            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For who is it that contemplates this admirable Frame of the World, and therein the Sun, Moon, and other Coeleſtial Bodies, conſidering their moſt bright Light, moſt powerful Faculties, ſundry turnings and returnings, and yet for ſo many Ages ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and regular, but that he muſt needs acknowledg a moſt wiſe and Almighty Creator? who that views this vaſt Region of the Air, and the Clouds therein flying and hanging over our Heads, and the Rains, Snows, Hails, Thunders, and other Meteors? who that weighs and ponders in his mind this Globe of Earth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we tread, hanging by Geometry in the empty Air, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the high Mountains, ſteep Hills, low Valleys, plain Fields, and theſe beſet with ſo many Trees, Shrubs, Herbs, Flowers, and Fruits, affording food to ſo many ſorts of living things which fly in the Air, creep and walk on the ſurface of the Ground; ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Fountains, Brooks, Rivers, and the Seas themſelves, and in them a countleſs crowd of Fiſhes? and in the Bowels of the Earth ſo many ſorts of Minerals, Mines, and Metals, ſo many Fires burning for ſo many Ages together, and the Waters with great violence ruſhing and rowling through the Bowels of the Earth without deſtroying the ſame? Who I ſay that ſees and conſiders all this without admiring the wiſdom and almighty power of
<pb facs="tcp:35070:3"/>God the Maker? Of whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf in the firſt to the <hi>Romans,</hi> thus writes; <hi>The inviſible things of God are cleerly ſeen by the Creation of the World, being underſtood by the things created; namely his Eternal Power and God-head:</hi> and <hi>Hermes</hi> or <hi>Mercurius Triſmegiſtus; Man is made to behold the Works of God, and he hath admired them, and known the Creator.</hi> But as the works of God in Nature are moſt wiſe and wonderful; ſo to ſearch into and know the ſame is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding hard, inſomuch that even the Prince of Philoſophers <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf did not bluſh to confeſs, that the eyes of our Underſtanding were to the Light of Nature as the eyes of Owls to the Mid-day Sun; and the moſt acute <hi>Julius Caeſar Scaliger</hi> in <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercit</hi> 307. <hi>Sect.</hi> 27. complains of the ſcantineſs of our Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and confeſſes that it is a part of Humane wiſdom to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly ignorant of ſome things; and in <hi>Exercit.</hi> 297. he inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly writes of himſelf (though otherwiſe a moſt acute man) I often give my ſelf the charge to look about, remember and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how weak the eyes of our minds an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to ſearch into the deep Myſteries of Nature. Yet ſince in great and hard matters it is a thing deſerving commendation, but to endeavor to do ſomwhat: Rare and Heroical wits in all Ages have not ſuffred themſelves by the difficulty of Nature to be frighted from the contemplation thereof. With whom though I cannot compare my ſelf; yet I was unwilling to lag behind, but ſpent a good part of my life in theſe Contemplations. And though I have found that common ſaying <hi>(Flattery gains Friends, but True ſpeaking breeds Foes)</hi> to be true, not only in civil Converſation, but alſo in Philoſophical Diſputations; while I have obſerved that thoſe who meerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite and tranſcribe the Inventions of our Anceſtors, are not ſo apt to be ſlandered and back-bitten; but thoſe who according to the Counſel of <hi>Seneca,</hi> being perſwaded that though our Anceſtors have done much, yet that they have not done all, and that there remains yet much work undone, have endeavored to add any thing to their Inventions, have made themſelves liable to hatreds and reproaches: yet have I alwaies more valued the Truth than the Friendſhip or Hatred of any man whoſoever. And therefore I have boldly adventured theſe my Meditations upon certain Heads of Natural Philoſophy into the publick, and having writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them a yeer or two ſince, now I communicate the ſame to others.</p>
            <p>And I was deſirous <hi>(moſt Illuſtrious Prince, and my gracious Lord)</hi> to dedicate them to the moſt Honored Name of your moſt Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious

            <p>And therefore <hi>Galen</hi> bids him that would find the Truth, <hi>to judg, try, and examine what he knows, a long time together, and to conſider what is agreeable to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt experience, and what is different therefrom, and to chuſe the one, and refuſe the other.</hi> And therefore, I my ſelf though in my youth I beſtowed no ſmal pains in the knowledg of Natural things: yet I obſerved that there were many things remaining not ſufficiently known, and Experience the Miſtriſs
<pb facs="tcp:35070:5"/>of al Knowledg, acquainted me with many things not before obſerved. But this is a thing which may be yet more wondred at, that ſince by a certain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and malignant perſon I have been ſo abuſed and ill handled, becauſe of certain Tenets differing ſomwhat from the common Opinions, ſcattered up and down in my Writings, what ſhould move me to propound the ſelf ſame things in a peculiar Treatiſe, which wil the more provoke and incite his fury. But in very deed, although I foreſee the Calumnies and Revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings whereunto I make my ſelf liable by ſo doing; yet the ſtudy of Truth, and of the knowledge of Natural things hath ſo far prevailed with me as to make me contemn them al, and care no more for them than I do for the barking of a Dog; eſpecially ſince I cannot ſee the man to produce any thing which is ſolid, and able to move a mind ſtudious of truth. I hear him indeed pitifully complain; <hi>That certain croſs grain'd Wits are arrived to ſo great a degree of Wantonneſs, and vain glorious Boldneſs, that they are not aſhamed to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw and drive out of the Schools, the Doctrine and Baſis of moſt true Principles, cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated and preſerved by the general Conſent of ſincere and learned Antiquity, and rightly uſed to this very day, againſt which every ſound witted and pious perſon makes conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to open his mouth; and to eſtabliſh their own abſurd, falſe, ſtinking, HERETICAL and BLASPHEMO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S Paradexes in their room; and by ſo doing, to corrupt all good Diſciplines, deſtroy the ſtudies of the Liberal Arts, reduce Barbariſm, and in this laſt dreggy Age of the declining World, to take away all true knowledg of things, and the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid wiſdom of the Ancients: and which vainly endeavor to deny the received and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally true Principles of venerable Antiquity, to weaken and pluck them up by the Roots; and to eſtabliſh for Principles in their room, their own Tenents and Paradoxes, fooliſh, colder than</hi> January, <hi>impious, falſe Heretical, long ſince condemned, or lately hatched in the Brainlets of Sycophants, and full of contradictions.</hi> But if any man ſhal ask what principles thoſe are, and upon what foundations eſtabliſhed, for the contempt and neglect whereof he makes, he makes ſo grievous complaints; and ſticks not to load good men with ſuch bitter revilings, and manifeſtlyes which that old Lyer and Slanderer the Devil hath ſuggeſted to him, he ſhall find nothing but Ignorance, both of the things themſelves, and the manner of Teaching, and if he go to the quick he ſhal find two things chiefly obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. The firſt is; That Forms are drawn out of the power of the matter. The other is, That in every Mixture there is a new form brought out, and the degrees of the former alwaies remaining that others do come, and that together with theſe new Qualities are emergent; and that Nature does aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, firſt univerſal forms, and by their means particular ones, til at laſt ſhe come to the forms of Individuals; and that ſo ſhe induces forms, firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Eſſence, and afterwards into the exiſtence, and the firſt for the laſt's ſake. Or that Nature firſt induces the forms of the Eſſence, then of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, or that the firſt educes the Univerſal forms, and by their help the particulars, until ſhe comes unto the Individual form and exiſtence. That thoſe firſt forms are for the laſt, and that their Eſſences do not periſh, nor are aboliſhed, but that there might be a more noble form for a more noble ſubject, laying aſide their rigor, and taking upon themſelves the office of matter as it were, they ſubmit themſelves to the power thereof; and out of this mixture of qualities ariſing from divers forms, and the mixture of bodies the forms being preſerved, and putting on the Nature of matter as it were, and power, that there ariſes a certain unſpeakable propriety of temperament, which may rightly after a ſort deſerve the name of an occult Quality. You ſhal find withal, that there are no reaſons brought to prove
<pb facs="tcp:35070:5"/>theſe things; but that this manner of the generation of Natural things which never was in Nature, nor ever will be, is obtruded upon us like an Oracle, ſo that he which does not admit and reverence the ſame, he muſt be ſaid to overthrow the Principles of Nature, to be an Inventer of new Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes, abſurd; and that there may be no want of Calumnies and lyes, he muſt be a Blaſphemer and an Heretick. If moreover you ſhall demand what is that ſame venerable Antiquity, of the contempt whereof he ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains; the greateſt Ariſtoteleans wil ingenuouſly confeſs, that they have never as yet been able to find thoſe Principles, and ſuch an Eduction of forms out of the aptitude of the matter; and therefore ſome wil anſwer that they muſt be aſcribed to <hi>Averroes,</hi> others not to him neither, ſince pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces contrary thereto are ſound in him, but to the School-men. Theſe (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) are the eternally true Principles of reverend Antiquity; this the Conſent of venerable Antiquity. But let us (truly) ſuppoſe that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> either invented or publiſhed them; yet is not <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (let me ſay with his good leave whom I admire and reverence as a great Philoſopher) the moſt ancient, but there was a time when he was but a new Writer; for which nevertheleſs his Writings could not be blamed: nor was <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> all Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, but there were before <hi>Ariſtotle, Pythagoras, Anaxagoras, Democritus, Empedocles, Leucippus, Meliſſus, Parmenides, Xenophanes, Socrates, Plato,</hi> all moſt learned and renowned men. And though <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> were the moſt ancient of all Philoſophers; yet he cannot therefore be taken for the Rule of Truth. For Truth is the ſquaring of the Notions which are in the Underſtanding, not with the Notions of another man, but with the things themſelves. All which things when I had weighed I would not ſuffer my ſelf to be frighted from the ſtudy of ſearching out the truth. This alſo hath moved me to publiſh ſuch things as I thought to have ſuppreſſed, becauſe I obſerved that mine Enemies did wreſt my Opinions into a ſtrange ſenſe which nere came into my mind, and charge me with Opinions that I never held. I thought it therefore more convenient (Friendly Reader) that you ſhould know my mind from this Writing of mine own, rather than from thoſe of other men. Out of which alſo thou ſhalt underſtand, That I was not the firſt that ſpread abroad theſe Opinions, which the envious and malignant Adverſary does ſo bitterly inveigh againſt, and load with all the Calumnies he is able to invent: but that there have been great Philoſophers, and ſuch as have been more verſ'd in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> than this Detractor, both in former Ages, and at this day; and as in other places, ſo in the moſt renowned Univerſities of <hi>Europe</hi> the chief Profeſſors, who have nothing to do with <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> who hold the ſame Opinions in theſe Points with me; and that I alone am unjuſtly chaſtiſed by this Detractor, and undeſervedly traduced as the Setter up of a new Sect.</p>
            <p>Accept therefore (Ingenuous Reader) with a friendly mind theſe ſecond Thoughts and Meditations of mine concerning certain wonderful Works of God, wherein my only endeavor hath been to preſent <hi>Nature</hi> unto thee, which is the ordinary Power of God, ſuch as the moſt Wiſe God hath fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med her. For I am not ignorant that it is an ungodly thing ſtubbornly to think and hold concerning Natural things, otherwiſe than God hath created them. If I have attained the Truth, I have reaſon to rejoyce: but if in this darkneſs of Mans Underſtanding I have ſomtimes erred; I hope mine honeſt and not unprofitable endeavor wil merit pardon; ſince according to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> thoſe that are minded certainly to know, muſt of neceſſity learn
<pb facs="tcp:35070:6"/>well to doubt. I freely offer my Opinion to be conſidered of; and let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other man (as is in a free Common-wealth fitting) freely offer his; he ſhal not offend me. I have never railed againſt any man differing from me in Opinion, nor being provoked with railings will I return railing for rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and reproach for reproach. For we are not only Philoſophers, but alſo Chriſtians, whoſe Duty it is not to return evil for evil, but patiently and contentedly to bear injuries.</p>

                  <p>And, Becauſe this Title, ſeemed in it ſelf, too much ſavoring of Arrogance;

                        </gap> Phyloſophy whence derived.</note> and many men void of all true Wiſdome, did for gaine or honors ſake, make profeſſion thereof, terming themſelves <hi>Sophous</hi> and <hi>Sophiſtas,</hi> that is to ſay, Wiſe Men or Sages: <hi>Pythagorar,</hi> both to avoid the Arrogance of that Title (for God alone is truly wiſe) and to diſtinguiſh himſelf from ſuch men as were wiſe only in Name, alſo to declare that Wiſdom is no common thing, nor within the reach of every Man; was the firſt that changed this Name, refuſing to be called <hi>Sophos,</hi> that is to ſay a Wiſeman or Sage, and chooſing in ſtead thereof the Title of <hi>Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophos,</hi> a Phyloſopher, or Lover of Wiſedom; as we find it recorded by <hi>Cicero</hi> in the firſt Book of his <hi>Tuſculans</hi> Queſtions, and by <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Third Book of the Opinions of Phyloſophers, Chap. 3.</p>
                  <p>The Novelty of this modeſt Title was ſo pleaſing to learned Men of all Sects, that they choſe all by common conſent to be called Phyloſophers, Lovers of Wiſedom, rather then <hi>Sophoi</hi> or <hi>Sophiſtai,</hi> Wiſemen or Sages. So that, if we conſider the Original of the word, <hi>Sapientia</hi> and <hi>Phyloſophia,</hi> Wiſedom and Phyloſophy, are of one and the ſame import.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit, The Word <hi>Sapientia,</hi> is commonly taken in a more ſtrickt ſence, ſo as to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the Metaphyſicks, as being reputed the moſt ſublime and excellent of all Theoretick Sciences and conſequently termed <hi>Prote Sophia,</hi> the principal part of Wiſedom, and <hi>Prote Phyloſophia,</hi> the moſt excellent Phyloſophy. Whereas on the contrary ſide, the ſame word <hi>Sapientia</hi> or Wiſedom is uſed in a larger ſence by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the ſixth Book of his <hi>Ethicks</hi> written to <hi>Nichomachus,</hi> Chapter, 7. where it is attributed unto Artificer and <hi>Phydias</hi> a carver in ſtone and <hi>Polycletus</hi> a maker of Statues, are termed <hi>Sapientes</hi> or wiſe Men.</p>
                  <p>But as the word Phyloſophy is ſufficiently known to all men;

                     </note> ſo are there very few that underſtand the true definition of the thing it ſelf. For thoſe main Definitions thereof, which go up and down among learned Men, are rather deicriptions and <hi>Encomiums,</hi> then right Definitions. <hi>Plato</hi> deſcribing the ſame in his <hi>Dialogue</hi> termed <hi>Phaedo,</hi> calls it <hi>The contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of Death.</hi> For, there being a twofold kind of Death, the one natural, which is a Separation of the Soul and Body; and the other ſuch a Death as whereby the Soul continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Body, is weaned from Earthly things, abandons vitious deſires, and gives it ſelf wholly up to the Contemplation of the moſt Excellent Objects: and ſeeing Phyloſophy reacheth, this ſame Abſtraction and Separation of the Soul from the Body, which is as it were the Priſon thereof, and the Garment of Ignorance, whereby it is clouded; therefore <hi>Plato</hi>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:35070:10"/>(though Metaphorically and therefore not ſo fitly) defines it to be, <hi>The Meditation of Death.</hi> In the ſame ſence, it is ſaid to be <hi>The Separation of the ſoul from the Body, An Affectation of Death,</hi> and a <hi>Cuſtomary courſe of Dying daily.</hi> And the ſame <hi>Plato</hi> in his Dialogue termed <hi>Theaetetus</hi> ſaies that <hi>Phyloſophy, is to ſtudy as much as may be to be like God.</hi> For the Operations of God being of two kinds, <hi>Viz.</hi> The knowledg of all things, and that Action whereby he Rules and Diſpoſes all: Phyloſophy makes a man capable of both theſe, as far as human Nature is capable. For ſhe both reaches us to contemplate all things, and to guide our Actions by the Rules of Honor and Honeſty.</p>
                  <p>That alſo is a common Definition of Philoſophy which was uſed by the <hi>Stoicks</hi> and by <hi>Tully</hi> in the Second Book of his offices,
<note place="margin">Cicero <hi>his Definition.</hi>
                     </note> Viz. That <hi>Philoſophy is the knowledg of all things divine and human.</hi> By human things underſtanding all things corporeal and ſubject to our ſences; and by things divine, meaning all ſuch things as being incorporeal are not ſubject to our ſenſes, but perceptible only by the underſtanding. Or by the term human, ſuch things may be underſtood, as tend to the Preſervation and Progagation of this mortal life and civil ſociety of mankind; and by the term divine ſuch ſublime matters as tranſcend vulgar Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                  <p>There are alſo certain definitions of Phyloſophy extant in the writings of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi>

                     </note> as where in the firſt Book of his <hi>Metaphyſicks,</hi> Chap. 1. he ſaies, it is the <hi>Science of Truth;</hi> and in another place (though this ſeems to be intended by him, as a definition of <hi>Metaphyſicks</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) he ſaies that, <hi>Phyloſophy is the knowledg of all things that are, not particularly, but generally conſidered.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs,
<note place="margin">Phyloſophy cannot be exactly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined.</note> as we ſaid before, theſe are not right definitions, but either <hi>Encomiums</hi> and <hi>Laudatory Elogies,</hi> or Tolerable deſcriptions, not containing the true kind not the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the thing defined. Yea and the very truth is Phyloſophy cannot be exactly defined becauſe it is not <hi>Genus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nivocum,</hi> and has a nature diſtinct from its parts. Neither is it <hi>Homonymal</hi> (for the parts thereof agree more then barely in name) but ſuch an one as they term <hi>Ab uno ad unum.</hi> For we muſt not think that Phyloſophy is ſome one ſcience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant about ſome peculiar ſort of being: but that it is the totall kind, comprehending all the Sciences in the world. For all things cannot be known by one habit of the mind, but by divers: which when they are all conjoyned, they make that perfection of knowledg, which is called Phyloſophy. And therefore all the definitions of Phyloſophy which are uſually brought, do ſwerve from the perfect Law of a Definition.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit from what has been already ſaid,
<note place="margin">Its Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> we may collect this following deſcription: <hi>Phyloſophy is an Habit of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, conſiſting in Wiſdom and Prudence, as that which contemplates all things, and ſo guides the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a Man, as that be may attain the Summum bonum, or cheif Felicity of which he is in this Life capable.</hi> For ſeeing a Man is perfected by Phyloſophy, and thereby qualified, it muſt needs be a certain quality or accidental form, by which a man is made fit to perform all the actions and Duties belonging to the human Nature. And it is ſuch a kind of quality as is not born with us (for no man is borne a Phyloſopher) but attained, being no other then an habitual ability, not of the body (for it is not the body of a man but his mind which wants perfection) but of the underſtanding. And therefore Phyloſophy is defined to be a twofold Habit of the underſtanding, viz. Wiſdom and Prudence, under which terms Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection and ſcience are comprehended.</p>
                  <p>We are now to conſider how Phyloſophy ought to be divided into its parts;
<note place="margin">The Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Phyloſophy according to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks.</note> which is a thing wherein Authors are not agreed. The Stoicks have divided Phyloſophy, into natural, moral and rational; under natural Phyloſophy, taking the phraſe in a large ſence, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend not only Phyſica or the Doctrine of Nature, properly ſo called, but alſo Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks and Mathematicks: by moral Phyloſophy they underſtand that Doctrine which regul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates the manners and actions of men; and by rational Phyloſophy or Logick that which teaches us how to reaſon, argue, and find out the truth. And the truth of this diviſion, they thus endeavor to prove. Seeing the happineſs of a man, which Phyloſophy aims at, does conſiſt partly in the actions of virtue, and partly in the contemplation of truth, hence two parts of Phyloſophy ariſe; the one of which inſtructs our Manners and actions according to the Rules of virtue, and is termed Moral Phyloſophy; the other is buſied in the inquiſition of truth and hunting our the ſecret myſteries of Nature, and is termed Phyſica, or natural Phyloſophy. And becauſe in the ſearch of Truth, we are very apt to miſtake, a third part is neceſſary, to teach us the way and method of reaſoning; which from <hi>Logos,</hi> reaſon, is called L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gica, Logick, or the Art of Reaſoning.</p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:35070:10"/>
                  <p> But this Diviſion of Phyloſophy,
<note place="margin">The ſame refuted.</note> is by very many and thoſe very learned interpreters of the peripatetick Phyloſophy, rejected, both becauſe the word Phyſica is therein improperly uſed, and becauſe it makes Logick a part of Phyloſophy. For the intent of Phyloſophers was, to include in this diviſion ſuch diſciplines, as treat about ſome real kind of being,
<note place="margin">Whether L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>gick is a part of Phyloſophy</note> the knowledg whereof denominates a man to be wiſe or a Phyloſopher, and Logick is no ſuch Diſcipline. For the Reaſons of things are not the ſubject thereof, becauſe compared to that which truly is, they have ſome ſort of beeing; for in this reſpect they belong to Meraphyſicks; nor becauſe, or in as much as they are framed by the mind of man, for ſo they belong to natural Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy; but only as inſtruments, profitable to denote our firſt conceptions, and ſuch things as truly are. And therefore Logick is not a part of Phyloſophy, but the inſtrument of a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, to guide his underſtanding, being invented not for its own ſake, but for the better underſtanding of all other ſciences. Which Ariſtotle confirmes in the firſt Book of his Topicks Chap. 9. Where he calls it the Handmaid of Phyloſophy, yet my intent is not contentiouſly to wrangle with any man that ſhal be of the opinion of <hi>Pererius</hi> in the ſecond Book of his Natural Phyloſophy, Chap. 18. viz. That when it is diſputed whether Logick be a Science or a part of Phyloſophy, the Controverſie is rather touching words and the manner of Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then the thing it ſelf; ſome taking the words Phyloſophy and Science, in a larger, others in a more preſs and proper ſignification.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Toletus</hi> divided Phyloſophy into three parts. Speculative, Active and Factive:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of</hi> Tolet.</note> taking the ground of his diviſion from that Ignorance which Phyloſophy cures in us, which is threefold, either of the Truth, and that part which heales this, teaching us to find out the truth, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Speculative or contemplative Phyloſophy; or it is Ignorance how to act and play our parts upon the ſtage of this world, and that which cures this, teaching us to conform our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Rule of right Reaſon, is called Active Phyloſophy; or finally it is the Ignorance of things neceſſary to maintain and preſerve our Lives, and that is healed by the Factive part of Phyloſophy, under which is comprehended all curious mechanical Artifices. But,
<note place="margin">The ſaid diviſion refuted.</note> though this diviſion be true in reſpect of the principal diſciplins: yet is it no good diviſion of Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy. For, the <hi>Factive</hi> Diſciplines are not to be reckoned as a part of Phyloſophy; For, they do neither contemplate things divine; nor do they regulate theſe actions which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to a Man; not is honeſty the thing they aime at, but Profit, nor does the chief good and Felicity of a man conſiſt in them. And who is there that dares reckon Smiths, Carpenters, Joyners, Weavers and ſuch like Artificers, amongſt Phyloſophers? For they are only the Servants of civil Policy. And therefore Lucian juſtly derides thoſe, which reckon Arts me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical as a part of Phyloſophy, when ſpeaking of one that was about to dig up a Feild, he ſaies, that with his Spade he would play the Phyloſopher.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore to be obſerved,
<note place="margin">The name of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin larger then of Phyloſophy</note> that the name of diſcipline is of larger Extent then that of Phyloſophy, and that all Diſciplines are not comprehended under the Notion of Phyloſophy. Yet has Phyloſophy obtained this peculiar dignity, that all diſciplines are either a part thereof, or fruits growing and reſulting there from; or an inſtrument provided and fitted for its Service.</p>
                  <p>I, for my part, take that to be the trueſt diviſion of Phyloſophy,
<note place="margin">Ariſtotle <hi>his diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                     </note> which is delivered by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the Second Book of his <hi>Metaphyſicks,</hi> Chap. 1. and retained by all ſorts of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, viz. into Speculative and Practical. The Speculative part, is that which contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plates all beings or things, with their Principles and Affections or Qualifications, only for knowledg and truths ſake: But the practical part of Phyloſophy is that whoſe ſubject is the Actions of Men, which it regulates according to the Rule of right reaſon and Honeſty; and does therefore teach us not only to know but to do alſo.
<note place="margin">The ſame confirmed firſt from the ſubject</note> For ſeeing the mind which Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy is to inform and frame, has two parts, the Intellective or underſtanding part, and the Appetitive or deſiring part, they make a double end, and it makes two parts of Phyloſophy; the Speculative, which perfects the knowing or Jntellective part of the Soul or mind, and the practical, which moderates the Appetitive part of the mind, and regulates our affections. So that the Duties of a wiſe man are two, to contemplate all things that are, and to performe ſuch actions as are beſt, and moſt ſuitable to the Life of a man. Or more briefly, to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate things divine and regulate human affairs. For, after that (to uſe the words of <hi>Marſilius Ficinus</hi> in the fourth Book of his Epiſtles) the Mind of a Phyloſopher, has contemplated what is the firſt good or goodneſs it ſelf, judging in human affaires, what things are good &amp; what bad what filthy and unſeemly, and what honeſt &amp; comely; what profitable, and what unprofitable: according to the pattern thereof he diſpoſes the affairs of men; draws them from that which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35070:11"/>is evil, and by this prudence of governing, he rules his own private Family, and the common-wealth, and teaches the lawes and waies of the Adminiſtration thereof. Nor was this diviſion unknown to the Platonicks, For theſe are the two wings wherewith the mind of man flies up to Heaven, from whence being weighed down with Earthly Cogitations, it had before fallen: concerning which ſee <hi>Plato</hi> in his Dialogues cald <hi>Phaedo</hi> and <hi>Phaedrus,</hi> and <hi>Marſilius Ficinus</hi> in the firſt Book of his Epiſtles Page, 612.</p>
                  <p>The Verity of the ſaid diviſion is further demonſtrated,
<note place="margin">Secondly the from Object.</note> from the end and Object. But moſt immediatly from its end: howbeit diſtinct Objects do produce diſtinct ends. For ſeeing every diſcipline is converſant about ſome one thing or other: and there are two kinds of things, as is apparent in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> his ſixth Book of Ethicks to <hi>Nicomachus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Two kinds</note> Chap. 3. Some things being neceſſary, others contingent, and of thoſe which are neceſſary, ſome are ſimply eternal, ungenerated and uncorrupted; others neceſſarily made,
<note place="margin">Of things.</note> which though they are not alwaies but are made; yet are they not produced by us; but by nature, working by certaine cauſes: Now the contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent are ſuch things as may or may not be, and whoſe principle is in the doer and not in the thing done, which depend upon our will, in the power whereof it is, to effect them or not. Hence we gather, there are two parts of Phyloſophy, one which is buſied about the things neceſſary, and the other about things contingent. And this diſtinction of things,
<note place="margin">Thirdly from the end.</note> does alſo produce divers Ends. For either we han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle a matter, only that we may know it, or that beſides the knowledg we may effect the ſame: a third cannot be aſſigned. For the things which alwaies are or which are made, but by Nature and not by our ſelves, we therefore handle, that we may know their nature. For what was ever ſo made, as to endeavor to effect ſuch things as are only poſſible for Nature, but impoſſible for all the Men in the world to effect? But thoſe things which are not alwaies, and may be effected by us, we do not handle only to know them, but that their Nature being diſcovered we may learn to effect them. And therefore thoſe former diſciplines, which are converſant about things, not for any operation, but for knowledg ſake alone, are rightly termed ſpeculative ſciences, or ſciences abſolutely and properly ſo called. But the other diſciplines, which are verſt in contingent things, or ſuch things as are ſubject to our will, are called diſciplines or ſciences (the word ſcience improperly taken) practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and operative.</p>

                     <note place="margin">what Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis is.</note> For every energy or Operation of a Man is not termed Praxis in this Caſe, but ſuch as is ſubject to the command of the will, and ſeeing many Errors may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen there abouts, it needs a certain habit, which being inherent in the practical un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, ſhould be its rule as it were in acting. Now thoſe Actions which are ſubject to the will are threefold. One proceeds from the will it ſelf, as Election or choice;
<note place="margin">Threeſorts of actions ſubject to the will.</note> a ſecond proceeds indeed from another power, yet is under the command of the will as the Operations of the wrathful and luſtful faculties of the Soul: and and touching this we cheifly ſpeak in this place. The third of it ſelf, is not ſubject to the will, but in ſome reſpect, as the operations of the ſpeculative underſtanding,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35070:11"/>are ſo far ſubject to the will, as they are performed at this time, and ſo long or ſo long, or according to other Circumſtances. Theſe therefore, as the former, ſeeing they are not ſimply ſubject to our will, do alſo not pertaine to this place. We may therefore well grant, that contemplation is an action, that is an act according to the inward energy or operation of the Mind: but no external act, ſuch as that is, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect whereto, one part of Phyloſophy is ſaid to ſpeculate, another to act. For this internal action is no way different from the knowledg of the truth, as in practical Diſciplines whoſe action differs from the knowledg of Truth, and whoſe end does not reſt in the truth known, but beſides that, proceeds to work ſomewhat.</p>
                  <p>And ſeeing as has been ſaid before that Phyloſophy has more then one ſingle ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; it is to be marked, that this name is attributed principally and primarily to the Speculative part, and conſequently and in the ſecond place to the Practical. For they are commonly termed Phyloſophers, who apply themſelves to the Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and who profeſs themſelves skilful to govern the life of man.</p>
                  <p>And this is the general diviſion of Phyloſophy:
<note place="margin">The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſion of ſpeculative Phyloſophy</note> afterwards each part is ſubdivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the ſixth Book of his Metaphyſicks Chap. 1. Divides the ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive part of Phyloſophy into <hi>Phyſica, Mathematica,</hi> and <hi>Metaphyſica.</hi> Which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion truly, was both received by the Ancients, and is this day in uſe, and has its reaſons to ſupport it.
<note place="margin">The ſame demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> For ſince the diverſity of Objects breeds a Diſtinction of ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, it is manifeſt that there are no more nor fewer ſciences, then the three aforeſaid. For a being is conſidered two waies, Univerſally and Particularly. That Science which conſiders the whole and Univerſal ſtate of Beings as beings, is Metaphyſica. The other Sciences conſider a being in Particular, and ſome ſort of being. And theſe are two, as there is a twofold ſort of beings. The one is in matter and cannot be known without matter, and this Phyſica conſiders: The other is indeed in matter, but it may be ſeparated therefrom by our thought, and may be known diſtinct from the matter, which is handled by <hi>Mathematica.</hi> And therefore <hi>Metaphyſica</hi> conſiders a being, only as it is a being: <hi>Phyſica,</hi> conſiders it as it is moveable or natural: <hi>Mathematica</hi> as it is abſtracted from Matter. But, as <hi>Pererius</hi> in the firſt Book of his <hi>Phyſica,</hi> Chap. 7. Rightly ſaies it would not be abſurd, if a Man ſhould add a fourth Science, which ſhould treat of ſpirits and ſubſtances ſeparated from matter, which ſome at this day term <hi>Pneumatica.</hi> Yea it were no Abſurdity to add a fift,
<note place="margin">Pneumati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.</note> which ſhould treat of ſuch things as might be naturally known concerning God.</p>
                  <p>Again there are ſeveral ſorts of Mathematical diſciplines.
<note place="margin">Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into pure and mixt.</note> For their ſubject is Quantity; which being double continual and diſcrete, there wil alſo be two Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces purely Mathematical, Arithmetick and Geometry. Muſick is ſubordinate to Arithmetick, from whence it borrows its principles, and conſiders Number as it is joyned with ſound. This according to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his firſt Poſteriora is two fold, Mathematical and aconſtick; but the former is truly and properly a Science, the Latter is rather to be termed an Art. Stereometria which conſiders the Doctrine of ſolid bodies is a part of Geometry. Nor is it ſubordinat to Geometry, becauſe it does not conſider Quantity with any Contraction, and addition of matter and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble quality; nor is it of a middle Nature between <hi>Phyſica</hi> and Geometria: but purely Mathematical; ſeeing it quite ſeparates its ſubject from ſenſible matter. To Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry, Perſpective is ſubalternate or ſubordinate, which conſiders a line as it is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: Now Geometry and Stereometry do bring forth Sundry diſciplines, which are in ſome ſort of a middle Nature betwixt Mathematical and Phyſical: yet are they called Mathematical, becauſe they uſe Mathematical principles, and conſiders all their ſubjects in relation to quantity. Such are: The Doctrine of the Raine-bowe, Aſtronomy, Coſmography, Geography, Chorography, Topography. Thence alſo afterward ſundry Mechanical Arts do ariſe.</p>
                  <p>The other part of Phyloſophy was the Practical.
<note place="margin">The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſion of Practical Phyloſophy</note> But Praxis taken in a large ſenſe, comprehends under it <hi>Poieſis</hi> and <hi>Praxis,</hi> properly ſo called. Now <hi>Praxis</hi> or Action differs from <hi>Poieſis</hi> or working, according to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the <hi>ſixth of his Ethicks to Nicomachus Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>and the firſt Book of his Magna Moralia Chap.</hi> 35. In that Action does leave no Work behind it: but Working or <hi>Poieſis</hi> is ſuch an Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as leaves a work behind it. From this twofold ſignification of the word Practice, two kinds of diſciplines ariſe, Active diſciplines, and Factive diſciplines. The factive are the Arts, as was ſaid before, and do not belong to Phyloſophy. But
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35070:12"/>the active part of Phyloſophy is divided into <hi>Ethica, Politica</hi> and <hi>Oeconomica.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the Utility of Phyloſophy,
<note place="margin">The Utility and neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy.</note> though that be cheifly to be regarded in the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical part: yet has the ſpeculative alſo its profit, of which we read much every where in Authors. Two Teſtimonies ſhall ſuffice in this place. The firſt is that of <hi>Hermes Triſmegiſtus</hi> in his Book Entitled, <hi>Of Piety and Phyloſophy. He that is pious and Godly is an exact Phyloſopher. For without Phyloſophy it is impoſſible to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly religious. But he which knowes the things that are, and how they are ordered, and by whom, and for whom: he will give thanks to the cheife workmaſter, as to a good Father, a loving Nurſe and a faithful Steward: And he that gives thanks is Godly; and he that is Godly and Pious, ſhall know, both where the truth is, and what it is, and the more he learnes, the more godly will be grow.</hi> The Second is that of <hi>Scaliger,</hi> in his 307. Exercitation <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>The Searching into theſe ſubtilties, although it be not profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to make Windmils or watermils to grind Corn; Yet it ſcoureth off the ruſt of Ignorance from our Minds and whets and prepares it to the knowledg of other things; in a word fills it with ſo much ſplendor, that it can light it ſelf to gain the ſimilitude of the firſt work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter: who as he is fully and perfectly all things, and beſides and above all things: ſo he will have thoſe to be his, that are ſtudious of the Sciences; and has made their underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, Lord of all things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Finally,
<note place="margin">The plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Phyloſophy</note> How great the pleaſure is which ariſes from the knowledg of Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy and cheifly the Speculative part thereof, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> teaches in his firſt Book <hi>de Partib. Animal.</hi> Chap. 5. I ſhall here ſet down what <hi>Caebius Rhodiginus, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Book and Chap.</hi> 30. <hi>of his Antiquae Lectiones,</hi> Cites out of <hi>Maximus Tyrius. You know,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>what it is that I think the Speculation of a Phyloſopher doer moſt reſemble?</hi> Viz. <hi>A manifeſt, clear and flying dream. For his Body remaining ſafe and ſound, his mind runs al the world over; it is carryed from Earth to Heaven; it paſſes over the whole Ocean Sea; it flyes through the whole Aire; with the Sun it compaſſes the Earth, with the Moon it walkes the round; it joynes it ſelf to the dance of the other ſtars, and comes little ſhort of bearing a ſhare with Jove himſelf, in the Mannagement of all things: O Happy Pilgrimage! O Beautyful ſhewes! O moſt true and real Dreams!</hi>

For it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates in a neceſſary ſubject the proper affections by the proper Cauſes: as very many demonſtrations touching things natural, do witneſs. And ſo alſo it is called by <hi>Ariſtotle, in the Third of his Phyſicks, Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>Text,</hi> 24. <hi>and the Second of his Metaphyſicks, Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>Text the Third,</hi> and the ſame is by him plainly proved, <hi>in the Fourth of his Metaphyſicks, Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>Text the</hi> 23. And although it be reported that of old,
<note place="margin">Whether it be the knowledg of Natural things.</note> 
                     <hi>Heraditus; Cratilus,</hi> and <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> held there was no knowledg of natural things, but only opinion; and <hi>Socrates</hi> being diſcouraged by the Mutability of natural things, and becauſe he thought he had no certain knowledg of them, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame, gave himſelf wholly to moral Phyloſophy; Alſo <hi>Democritus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of the deep pit of truth which had no bottom, and Empedocles of the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row paſſages of the ſenſes: yet it ſeemes moſt probable that theſe Phyloſophers did not deny all knowledg, but rather modeſtly diſſembled their own knowledg, then confeſſed their Ignorance; ſeeing what we know in compariſon to what we know not, is little more then nothing; and taxed their Arrogance who did vainly boaſt of their own Wiſdome. And as for the new Sect of <hi>Academicks</hi> who did not only deny that there was any knowledg of things natural, but that there was any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of any thing, they are elſe where refuted. Nor let that trouble us, becauſe in natural Phyloſophy many times probable Reaſons are invented. For theſe take not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35070:12"/>away from the neceſſity of the Sciences truth, but do often prepare and fence the way to following demonſtrations, or are uſed to declare the principles.</p>
                  <p>We muſt therefore hold that <hi>Phyſica</hi> or Natural Phyloſophy is a ſcience and that properly ſo called, viz. A ſpeculative ſcience, as appears out of <hi>the ſixth of</hi> Ariſtotles <hi>Metaphyſicks Chap.</hi> 4. And out of <hi>the firſt of Metaphyſicks Chap.</hi> 6. Although it be in a manner ſuperfluous to ad the term ſpeculative, ſeeing if we take the word Science properly, all Sciences are ſpeculative: now words are not to be improperly uſed in Definitions.</p>
                  <p>Now as concerning the neceſſary truth of <hi>Phyſica</hi> or Natural Phyloſophy,
<note place="margin">Natural Phyloſophy has two ſorts of propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> we muſt obſerve, that there are in this Science two ſorts of Propoſitions; ſome are alwaies and ſimply neceſſary, as the fire burnes: the knowledg whereof is moſt properly called Science: others are neceſſary for the moſt part, concerning ſuch things, as are in their ſubject, only in a certaine ſtate, or for the moſt part, and when all impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are removed; as a Man is born in the ninth Month, with two hands, two Eyes, two Kidneys. For theſe diſpoſitions are of a middle Nature betwixt contingent and neceſſary, and therefore ſome do call them neceſſary, by a Phyſical or natural Neceſſity.</p>
                  <p>Now before we ſpeak of the ſubject of <hi>Phyſick</hi> or Natural Phyloſophy,
<note place="margin">The ſubject thereof.</note> ſome things are to be premiſed concerning the word ſubject. For this word has ſundry ſignifications. 1. A ſubject is that wherein there are accidents. 2.
<note place="margin">The terme ſubject how many waies uſed?</note> A ſubject is that part of a propoſition of which ſomwhat is affirmed. 3. The matter is termed a ſubject in reſpect of its forme. 4. A thing is ſaid to be a ſubject in reſpect of ſome Action and Operation; and it is that about which the Artiſt or workman is employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and whereupon he exerciſes his Labor. 5. That is termed a ſubject, which is handled in any Science. Now it is ſo called, becauſe it is ſubjected to ſuch accidents and affections as are demonſtrated therein, as alſo becauſe our knowledg is conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant thereabout. And in this laſt acceptation, we do here take the word ſubject:
<note place="margin">How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in the place?</note> in which ſence nevertheleſs, it is taken divers waies. For firſt in a more large ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, all that is termed ſubject, whereof we treat in any Science, whether it be a principle, an affection and accident, or any other thing. But properly that thing or matter which is therein conſidered is called the ſubject of a Science,
<note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the ſubject of a ſcience</note> which ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject has theſe Properties. Firſt, That we know that it is in Nature alwaies and neceſſarily, and what the name thereof ſignifies. And therefore the ſubject is never demonſtrated in its proper Science. For ſeeing it is the Baſis and Foundation of all things delivered in the Science, if that ſhal be called into Queſtion, denied, and taken away, all things that are ſaid thereof, are denied and taken away. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond condition is, that it have proper affections or diſpoſitions, and proper princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, of all which it is the Baſis and Foundation. And therefore a ſubject, in that Science wherein it is a ſubject, is not conſidered as inherent in any other thing; and every thing that is conſidered in any Science, as being inherent in ſome other thing, is not the ſubject of that Science. The third is, that it be adaequate or commenſurate to the whole Science, and not wider or narrower then it, and that all things which are delivered in the Science, do pertain to the Explication thereof.
<note place="margin">Two parts thereof.</note> Of a ſubject thus conſidered there are two parts: one is as it were the matter, and is termed the thing conſidered; the other is in ſtead of the form, and is termed the manner of conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The thing conſidered, may be common to many diſciplines: but the manner of conſidering, which contracts the thing to a certain and peculiar way of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is proper to every Science, and thereupon properly depends the diſtinction of Sciences.</p>
                  <p>Touching this Adaequate ſubject of Natural Phyloſophy,
<note place="margin">The divers opinions of Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers about the ſubject of Natural Phyloſophy</note> there is ſome difference amongſt authors, moſt of the Greek Interpreters of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> do make the ſubject of this Science to be <hi>Corpus Naturale,</hi> a Natural Body; <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> ſaies it is <hi>Ens Mobile,</hi> a Moveable being; <hi>Albertus</hi> and <hi>Aegidius</hi> ſay it is <hi>Corpus Mobile,</hi> a move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Body; <hi>Scotus</hi> wil have it to be, a Natural ſubſtance; <hi>Tolet</hi> makes it, a Natural Being; others ſay it is Nature, by nature underſtanding God and Angels and al Bodies, others again wil have it to be nature, meaning thereby al things pertaining to natural Bodies ſuch as are not only the compound bodies themſelves, but alſo their principles and affections or diſpoſitions: others ſay it is <hi>Ens Mobile,</hi> a moveable being, not only, as <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> underſtanding thereby, a moveable Body, but alſo the matter
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35070:13"/>and forme: others will have it to be <hi>Corpus Naturale Miſtum,</hi> a mixt natural Body: others, a Body ſubject to generation and corruption.</p>
                  <p>It is not worth the while to produce in this place,
<note place="margin">The true opinion.</note> all the Arguments that are brought to juſtifie theſe ſeveral opinions. I approve only of the firſt opinion, which ſaies the ſubject of this Science, is a natural Body. To this opinion (as ſhall be ſaid hereafter) I conceive the four following may be reduced; and moſt learned men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the ſtrife is more about words then the thing it ſelf, and that herein lies the controverſie, how the ſubject of this Science, the thing it ſelf being agreed upon, ſhould be called: whether a Natural Body, a moveable being, a Natural ſubſtance, a Natural being: and therefore theſe other opinions are to be reduced to the firſt, or are ſimply to be rejected, as the latter five.</p>
                  <p>The adaequate ſubject therefore of Natural Phyloſophy is a natural Body,
<note place="margin">
                        <p>The adae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Phyſick</p>
                        <p>Natural, how many waies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood?</p>
                     </note> in as much as it has in it Nature, that is to ſay a principle of motion and reſt. For Natural is taken three waies. Firſt, For that which is eſſential to any thing, and belongs to the very eſſence or being thereof: Secondly, For every thing which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes the knowledg of Nature; in which ſenſe, both the firſt matter and form and accidents of a Natural Body, are termed Natural: Thirdly, And properly it is taken for that which has Nature in it, that is to ſay, a certain internal principle of motion and reſt; and ſo neither motion, nor matter is termed Natural, but only Bodies compounded of matter and forme. And ſeeing the Adaequate ſubject of a Science, as was ſaid before, conſiſts in the thing conſidered, and the manner of conſidering the ſame: the thing conſidered in this Science, is a body, and the manner of conſidering is, in as much as it has Nature in it, that is to ſay. A principle of motion and Reſt. For although every Body has in it a principle of motion, and that which has in it a principle of motion is a body; yet in as much as a body may be conſidered, not only as it has in it a principle of motion, but in divers other reſpects: by this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Natural Phyloſophy is diſtinguiſhed from other diſciplines, which do alſo treat of a Body.</p>
                  <p>And that what has been ſaid touching the ſubject of this Science,
<note place="margin">Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Opinion propoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> is true, may hence appear: in that all the porprieties of the ſubject of a Science do agree here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. For it is fore known what it is, and what the name thereof ſignifies, it has its proper principles matter and form; its proper affections as motion, place, time &amp;c. nor is it in this Science, inhaerent in any other thing, and it is Adaequate or commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurate to the whole Science. For all things delivered in Natural Phyloſophy, are either the principles of a natural Body, or its affections, or its kinds and ſorts. The ſame alſo is apparent from <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> For as to the thing conſidered in this Science, that it is truly ſaid to be a Body, appears from the <hi>Begining of his Second Book of Phyſicks, and his</hi> 3. <hi>de Caelo Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>and his firſt de Caelo:</hi> Where he tels us that the Science of Nature is converſant about Bodies, and that it conſiders their principles and affections.</p>
                  <p>And that the manner of conſidering is, in as much as the ſame Body has nature in it, is apparent from the begining of his Second Book of Phyſicks. For ſeeing all things are diſtinguiſhed from other, by their form; and things natural differ from artificial and non-natural things, becauſe they have the principle of their motion in themſelves, but the other only by accident: doubtleſs, to have in it ſelf a principle of motion, is in ſtead of the form, and the formal reaſon of the ſubject, whereby a Body, the thing conſidered in Natural Phyloſophy, is differenced from all other things. The ſame is confirmed by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in the Second Book of his Phyſicks, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>Text</hi> 70. or 71. Where he ſaies: <hi>What ever things move being themſelves moved, do belong to the conſideration of Natural Phyloſophy &amp;c.</hi> For he teaches, that thoſe things only are conſidered by a Natural Phyloſopher, as his ſubject, which have in themſelves a principle of motion. Howbeit, other things may alſo be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in natural Phyloſophy, which have not in them a principle of motion, but it is as they are principles or Accidents to bodies Natural, but not as the proper ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Science of Nature. Which is manifeſt from the 73. <hi>of the ſame Book,</hi> where he ſaies, that there are ſome principles Phyſically moving, but not Phyſical; that is to ſay not conſidered as the ſubject of <hi>Phyſica</hi> or natural Phyloſophy, becauſe they have not in themſeles a principle of motion,
<note place="margin">The Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>iled.</note> And this is the true Opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſubject of this Science, to which, as was ſaid, the following four
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:35070:13"/>Opinions muſt be reduced, or rejected. For ſeeing theſe Opinions contain two manner of conſidering the ſubject, the one, as it is moveable; the other, as it is Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural: both of them do ſignifie, indeed, nothing elſe, but Nature having in it a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of motion. For ſince moveable, may be taken two waies,
<note place="margin">Movable underſtood two waies.</note> as for that which hath an aptitude to motion, which is a certain affection of a natural thing; or for that which hath Nature in it, that is matter and forme, or the Principle from whence ſuch aptitude ariſes: moveable cannot be taken here in the former ſenſe, but only in the latter. Becauſe the paſſion of a ſubject cannot be its <hi>Ratio Formalis,</hi> or formal Conſtitutive conſideration; and with its ſubject it makes a thing which is acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally one, and is later then its ſubject, of which it may alſo be demonſtrated. Hence therefore would follow this Abſurdity, that the ſubject, <hi>viz.</hi> A thing moveable, ſhould in its proper Science, be demonſtrated by its proper Cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Nature. And therefore, <hi>Moveable</hi> cannot be taken for a paſſion, but for the reaſon and eſſential degree of a Body, from which of it ſelf motion ariſes. In ſenſe it denotes nothing elſe, but natural, or that which hath Nature in it. Howbeit, if we ſhal accurately weigh the matter, the manner of conſidering is better and righter deſcribed by the term Natural, or that which hath Nature, then by the word Moveable. For ſeeing <hi>Natural</hi> includes both motion and reſt, and <hi>Moveable</hi> only motion; the former is commenſurate, the latter not. And therefore either we muſt take <hi>Moveable</hi> for Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and that which hath Nature, or we muſt reject it as leſs Proper and not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurate. Since from all which hath been ſaid it appears, that <hi>Natural,</hi> or <hi>in as much as it hath Nature in it,</hi> is the true manner of conſidering the ſubject of this Science, therefore by all means we muſt make the thing conſidered to be equal there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. But if we ſhal conſider all things which are placed in the Predicament of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, we ſhall find nothing but <hi>Body</hi> equal thereunto. For what ever hath in it a principle of motion is a Body, And therefore it muſt needs be, that both Ends or Being, and ſubſtance, are taken for a Body, But a Body in as much as it hath Nature in it, is more properly ſaid to be the ſubject of natural Philoſophy, becauſe to have Nature is accidental to <hi>Subſtance,</hi> and to <hi>Being,</hi> unleſs they be taken in a prickt ſenſe for a Body. Nor is there ſuch a proportion betwixt <hi>Subſtance, Being,</hi> and <hi>Natural,</hi> as ought of neceſſity to be, betwixt the thing conſidered and the manner of conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. For <hi>A Being</hi> is not ſaid to be Moveable, as it is a <hi>Being;</hi> for ſo every Being ſhould be Moveable.</p>
                  <p>And if there be any that will not allow their opinion to be thus corrected, and wil endeavor to obtrude upon us, ſomwhat more common, or more narrow, for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of natural Phyloſophy, they are juſtly to be reproved. For thoſe that wil have God himſelf, the Intelligences, and Angels, to be handled in Natural Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, as the ſubject thereof: truly they do abſurdly and unskilfully confound things abſtract and ſimple with bodily things and ſuch as are overwhelmed in matter. For ſeeing theſe things are exceedingly different, how can any man aſſign to them one manner of conſideration, which is the thing which makes a Science to be one?</p>
                  <p>Nor do thoſe men think a right, who make Nature the ſubject of natural Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy; underſtanding, thereby, both the principles, and affections, and Compounds. For they do not rightly uſe, neither the word <hi>Subject</hi> nor the word <hi>Nature.</hi> For a ſubject properly ſo called, whereof we diſcourſe in this place, is not taken fo every thing that is handled in a Science, but for that whoſe conditions are ſuch, as have been ſet down before, and which is diſtinguiſhed from the Principles and Affections. Again, they do ill in confounding <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>a thing Natural;</hi> which they might eaſily learn, out of, <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> ſecond Book of Phyſicks <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. where the Phyloſopher ſhews us, how <hi>Nature, Natural</hi> and <hi>according to Nature,</hi> differ one from another.</p>
                  <p>Alſo we approve not their opinion, who conceive that <hi>Ens Mobile</hi> a <hi>Moveable Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is to be counted the ſubject of this Science; and by <hi>Mobile</hi> they underſtand al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the matter and the form. For nothing is called moveable, but that which is the ſubject of motion: and nothing hath in it a principle of motion but a Body. For matter is not moved of it ſelf, but by accident, <hi>viz.</hi> In as much as, it is a part of that Body which is moved. But if ſo be whatever hath any relation to motion, ſhould be called movable al things explained in this Science, will be ſeveral ſorts of its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and therefore there will be no Principles, no Affections or adjuncts, different therefrom.</p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:35070:14"/>
                  <p> And as we have rejected their opinion, who make ſomwhat more common then a Natural Body, to be the ſubject of this Science; ſo can we not agree to them, who wil have the ſubject thereof, to be ſomwhat more narrow. For ſome make the <hi>thing conſidered</hi> to be, a Natural Body tranſitory, or ſubject to mutation: others, a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Body mixt. Yet they agree in the manner of conſideration, which both make to be <hi>in as much as it is Movable.</hi> But they <hi>both are</hi> in an Error. As to the thing Conſidered; becauſe the former reject the Heavens; the latter both the Heaven and Elements, from being ſorts of the ſubject, and will allow them to be only Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples thereof. For things muſt be ſo handled and conſidered, as they are conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Nature, Seeing therefore the Heaven and Elements are ſo produced by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as not only that they ſhould be the Principles of other things, but alſo, that as peculiar ſorts of Bodies, they might compleat the Univerſe: they are to be known and handled both waies. As we ſee <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath alſo done; who explained them after the former manner in his Book of Generation and corruption; after the latter in his Books touching the Heavens: in which Books, whatever is ſaid of the Heaven and Elements, is ſaid without any reſpect to mixt Bodies. As to the manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, they are both out, in that they make it more large then the th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ng conſidered. For not only, things mixt and ſubject to mutation, but the Elements alſo are Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, or have in themſelves a Principle of motion.</p>
                  <p>From all the Premiſes,
<note place="margin">The defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy.</note> let us at laſt infer; that, <hi>Phyſica</hi> or <hi>Natural Phyloſophy, is the Science of Natural Bodies, or of ſuch as have Nature in them.</hi> Whereof being now to treat, I ſhall chiefly follow that ſame Eagle-Ey'd Phyloſopher <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> For he did ſo excel in this part of Phyloſophy, that though ſome do make him infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to <hi>Plato</hi> in matters divine, (which <hi>Scaliger</hi> nevertheleſs denies again and again in the 365. of this <hi>Bxercitations, Sect.</hi> 3. Yet in this Science he will eaſily bear away the Bell. I will ſay nothing of the <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> I ſhal only relate what is reported of <hi>Plato.</hi> For he coming upon a time into his School, and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> being not there, he cried out, <hi>The Phyloſopher of Truth is abſent.</hi> And another time when he was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, he ſaid, <hi>The Mind is not come.</hi> And amongſt the Peripateticks innumerable company of moſt Famous Men and every way moſt learned, Greeks, Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians, and Latines have handed this Phyloſophy to Poſterity, and ſpent all their lives in explaining the ſame, and acknowledged it alone for the true Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, and have judged it worthy of ſo much honor, as never any other Phyloſophers Phyſicks were thought worthy of, In the mean time, I would not detract from the diligence and Induſtry of others, nor would I cal any man from making a more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſearch into the ſecrets of Nature. Thoſe who have gone before us (ſaith <hi>Seneca</hi>) have done much, but they have not done all. There is much work yet remaines, and much there will remain, and he that ſhall be born a thouſand Ages hence wil not want occaſion to add ſomwhat or other. But that Man will do it more eaſily, who, hath known theſe things aforehand: and it is eaſie to add to things invented.</p>
                  <p>And that I may propound a Summarie of al Natural Phyloſophy,
<note place="margin">Natural Phyloſophy divided into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and proper part.</note> as in a table be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Eyes; you muſt know, that <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Interpreters have fitly divided all this Science into two parts; the former they call <hi>common,</hi> the latter <hi>Proper.</hi> In the firſt we are to treat of the kind it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> A Body Natural commonly taken. And of all things appertaining to a Natural Body ſo generally conſidered; which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> handles in his 8. Books of Natural Phyloſophy cal'd <hi>Peri Phyſices Acroaſews.</hi> In the other, we are to treat of all the ſorts of Natural Bodies; which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> does in all his other Books of Natural Phyloſophy.
<note place="margin">A Natural body how many waies underſtood?</note> Nor is this diviſion without Reaſon. For, A Natural Body is taken three manner of waies. 1. Only for the common kind, in it ſelf conſidered, without any conſideration of the ſorts. 2. For a Collection only of the ſorts. 3. For both together. <hi>viz.</hi> Both for the common kind, and the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of al the ſpecies or ſorts Nor are Natural Bodies only to be conſidered, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Proper affections, but alſo according to the common. Nor muſt the common affections, of the kind be attributed to the ſorts, nor muſt ſuch things as are proper to the ſorts, be demonſtrated of the kind. A Body Natural therefore taken in the firſt ſenſe, is the ſubject of the common part; taken in the ſecond ſenſe, of the proper; and in the third, of the whol Science.</p>
                  <p>We muſt therefore in Natural Phyloſophy, treat in the firſt place of a Body Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural in general, and conſider its principles and common affections, which agree to al Natural Bodies, conſidered as ſuch. And ſeeing a Natural Body is twofold, Simple
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:35070:14"/>and compound: we muſt firſt diſcourſe of a ſimple natural Body, and its ſorts, the Heaven and Elements, or of the world as it is a maſs of al ſimples. After the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of ſimple bodies, muſt follow the Doctrine of a mixt body; and firſt in general, where its principles, viz. The four Elements and its general affections or adjuncts are to be explained. Here therefore we muſt treat of the Elements, and of their qualities, of Action, Mixture, Generation and corruption. Mixt bodies, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are twofold, perfectly and imperfectly mixed: in the firſt place we conſider things imperfectly mixed; and then ſuch as are perfectly mixed. And ſeeing things perfectly mixed are either ſimilar or diſſimilar: firſt we muſt treat of a body Homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneal, perfectly mixed; which is handled by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the fourth of his Mereors. Afterwards the ſeveral ſorts hereof are to be explained, as things dug out of the Ground, Mettals, and al the ſimilary parts which conſtitute Animals and plants. Here therefore we muſt treat of things dug our of the Earth and of Mettals. For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſimilar mixt things, becauſe they exiſt not by themſelves in nature, but are therefore only, that they may conſtitute Animals and Plants, we muſt not treat of them in any other place, ſave where we diſcourſe of Plants and Living Creatures. And thus far may that part of Natural phyloſophy be extended, which treats of thoſe things which are common to things living, and things liveleſs. And the laſt place we muſt treat of ſuch things as concern only things living: and ſo the whole doctrine of natural Phyloſophy, ſhal end in the Explication of plants and Animals.</p>

<note place="margin">Whether a Principle and Cauſe do differ and how?</note> yet they are found ſomwhat to differ amongſt Phyloſophers. For a principle is commonly of a larger extent then a cauſe.

For the term from whence any man ſets upon the way, &amp; the point whence a line flowes, are the Beginnings of a way and a Line, but not the cauſe. But paſſing over the ſundry ſignifications of a principle, let us now treat thereof, as it concurs to the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and generation of things Natural. In which ſenſe, Principles are by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> thus defined: <hi>Principles are ſuch things, as are neither made of other things, nor one of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, but all things are made of them.</hi> And ſo there are <hi>three</hi> conditions of Phyſical Principles. <hi>Firſt,</hi> that they be not made of other things. For if they were made of others, they ſhould receive their Eſſence, from the principles of another Nature, and ſo themſelves ſhould not be principles. The <hi>Second,</hi> That they be not one made of another. For if one of them did conſtitute another and were a part of the ſame Eſſence, they ſhould neither be <hi>Firſt</hi> nor <hi>Simple.</hi> The <hi>Third,</hi> that all Natural things be made of them and receive their Eſſence from them.</p>
                  <p>Now as concerning the number of <hi>Principles</hi> there were ſundry not only Opinions but Dreams alſo of the Ancients,
<note place="margin">The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of principles is three.</note> which becauſe they are largly confuted by <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> in the <hi>firſt of his Phyſicks,</hi> and the moſt of them are now vaniſhed: Yea and ſome of them are not ſufficiently underſtood: I ſhal here paſs over all thoſe Opinions, and only undertake to explain that of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> as moſt agreeable to truth, who aſſerted only three principles of Natural things, <hi>viz. Matter, Forme,</hi> and <hi>Privation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yet this one thing I muſt premiſe,</hi> That while I eſtabliſh theſe three principles, I do not exclude that only firſt Principle of all things, <hi>God,</hi> eternal, immortal, only one and indiviſible, from whom and in whom are all things, but my enquiry is only after the firſt Natural principles of all things. For neither does <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> deny that all things have their dependance upon the moſt good and great God; as appears in the firſt Book of his <hi>Metaphyſicks, Chap.</hi> 2. Where thus he writes: <hi>For God ſeems to be the Cauſe and principle as it were of all things.</hi> And in the fifth Probleme of the thirtieth Section. <hi>God hath given us two Organs within us, wherewith we make uſe of the Organs that are without: viz. To our Body the Hand, to our Soul, the Mind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now being to ſearch out the number of Natural principles; we will take out
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:35070:15"/>beginning from hence, that <hi>the principles of things are contrary one unto another:</hi> which both all the ancients do ſeem to grant, and the thing it ſelf argues as much. For thoſe are called principles, which are neither made one of another, nor of any other thing, but all things are made of them. Now ſuch things are prime contraries. For ſeeing they are firſt, they are not made of any other: and becauſe they are contraries they are not made one of another, for one contrary cannot change into the ſubſtance of another thing which is contrary to it. <hi>Moreover</hi> experience it ſelf does witheſs; that of all things that are, every thing does not act upon every thing, nor ſuffer from every thing, nor is every thing made of every thing, unleſs accidentally; but every thing acts upon its contrary, and ſuffers from its contrary, is made of its contrary, and diſſolved into its contrary; or as <hi>Galen</hi> ſpeaks in his <hi>firſt Book of Temperaments, Chap.</hi> 2. Every mutation is made by a contrary, and of a contrary, and into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
                  <p>Seeing therefore the Principles of things are contrary, they muſt needs be more than one: for contraries are not one, nor can one thing be contrary to it ſelf. 1 <hi>Phyſ. Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>Text,</hi> 50. Nor yet can they be infinite. For ſo ſhould there be no knowledg of Natural things, which depends upon the knowledg of them Principles, and Nature it ſelf abhors infinity. Moreover, ſince in every kind, there is one firſt contrariety; and of one contrariety, two extreams: conſequently in a ſubſtance there are not infinite contrarieties, but thoſe two firſt and extream are to be held for principles.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore two firſt contrary Principles are ſufficient: one from which the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is made, and which is the term from which the other, to which the Progreſs is made, or the term to which. Howbeit theſe contraries are not alone ſufficient for the conſtitution of a thing. For as a contrary doth not make its contrary; ſo they alone of themſelves cannot conſtitute a ſubſtance. For that contrary which is indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, cannot be received into that which is expelled; ſeeing contraries do mutually reſiſt one another; and at the end of the motion, that contrary which is expelled, ceaſes to be. A third principle therefore of things muſt be added, which is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to neither of the other two, and which one while with one, may conſtitute one natural thing, another while with the other may conſtitute another, and which may be the ſubject of thoſe contraries, by turnes. For ſeeing in every mutation a ſubject is required (for an accident cannot be without a ſubject) as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in <hi>the firſt of his Phyſicks Chap.</hi> 7. Proves by Induction; and which in the mutation of accidents, is moſt of all apparent, wherein we ſee there is a common ſubject of the accidental form aboliſhed, and of that which is bred a new: and it is manifeſt that there is no progreſs from contrary to contrary, without ſome ſubject matter: the ſame is to be concluded touching that ſubſtantial mutation, which happens in a natural body.</p>
                  <p>And theſe three principles do ſuffice. For both one ſubject is enough to ſuffer: and two contraies to act. For one contrary can corrupt its contrary. The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples therefore are <hi>Partly</hi> contrary, which are called <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Privation:</hi> and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not contrary. For the ſubject which we call <hi>Matter,</hi> is apt to receive al forms. And they are all three neceſſary to Generation, which is nothing but a progreſs from the privation of one form in the matter, to the acquiſition of a new form: yet every one after a peculiar manner, <hi>viz.</hi> The form as the <hi>terminus ad quem,</hi> the terme to which the motion is made; Privation, as the terme from which: the Matter, as the ſubject of the Mutation. Howbeit to the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of a thing, two principles are only neceſſary <hi>viz.</hi> Matter and Form. For privation, beſides that it is no ſubſtance ſeeing it is contrary to the form, it cannot conſiſt therewith. Hence <hi>Simplicius up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt of Ariſiotles Phyſicks,</hi> ſaies, To enquire after the Principles of natural things, is one thing, to enquire into the principles of mutation, is another; for of things na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Privation is an accidental Cauſe; but of Mutation it is a direct cauſe, or a cauſe by it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things being thus generally ſpoken touching the principles of natural things,
<note place="margin">Whether there be a Materia prima, or firſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> let us proceed to handle them in particular. And as to the <hi>firſt Matter,</hi> although that there is ſuch a thing in Nature, was before proved: yet let us prove it again, after this manner. Whatſoever is made, is either made ſimply of nothing, or of ſomthing. Not of nothing, for that is creation and not Generation; and therefore of ſomthing, now that of which a thing is generated, is either only form, or the whol
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:35070:15"/>compound, or ſomwhat beſides theſe. Not the two former. For in the Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a new thing the former form periſhes. There is therefore ſomwhat elſe remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning beſides the form in that thing, out of which a new ſubſtance is generated, <hi>viz</hi> the matter, which hath a privation of the thing to be generated, and which is apt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive as well that form which it now actually poſſeſſes, as that which, the former being aboliſhed is introduced into its place. Now that this <hi>is the firſt ſubject</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon no other, is thus proved. Whatever things are changed, have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſubject. Al theſe ſublunary things are changed one into another; if not al im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly, yet mediately. For things mutually ſight one againſt another, with contrary qualities, alter one another, and throw one another from their natural ſtate and condition. Therefore they have al a common ſubject. For if it were of ſome other thing, it would not be ſubject to all mutations: and if it were not common, al things could not be changed.</p>
                  <p>But what is the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of <hi>Matter</hi> is exceeding hard to find out,
<note place="margin">The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the firſt matter is obſcure &amp; exceeding hard to be known.</note> and can hardly be diſcerned by a direct knowledg. For as eſſential mutation, by which it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, that there is matter, was known by way of analogy from accidental mutation; even ſo by analogy, and a certaine baſtard kind of knowledg and inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaies) we come to the knowledg of matter. For from the knowledg of ſenſible matter, we are led to the knowledg of inſenſible: and ſo is matter related to form Natural, as Braſs or Wood to the Form or Figure of Mercury. For even as Braſs or wood, does in it ſelf actually poſſeſs no artificial form; yet is it furniſhed with a power to receive al forms: even ſo the firſt matter, hath in it ſelf, no determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſpecifick natural forme; yet is it apt to receive all formes, howbeit herein they differ, in that the artificial matter is a body of it ſelf exiſting and perfect: but the Natural matter doth not exiſt by it ſelf without the form.</p>
                  <p>Now matter is conſidered <hi>Two maner of waies,</hi> one abſolutely,
<note place="margin">Matter is conſidered two man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of waies.</note> as it is a beeing or a certain ſubſtance: the other, repectively, as it is a principle of natural things. In the firſt manner of conſideration, we ſay it is void of all formes and Qualities, Dimenſions and Quantities, and we allow it a power of receiving indifferently all formes; in which reſpect <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the <hi>ſixth of his Metaphyſicks, Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>Text.</hi> 8. Deſcribes it by the negation of all things. <hi>In the ſecond notion</hi> we attribute unto it a power of receiving particular forms, and privation; in which ſignification <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the firſt of his Phyſicks <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. <hi>Text.</hi> 82. Defines it,
<note place="margin">The difini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of matter.</note> that it is <hi>The firſt ſubject of every thing, of which every thing is made, being not accidently inherent, and into which it returnes when it is corrupted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And although in its firſt notion, it can very hardly be known,
<note place="margin">The firſt matter is no notion of the brain.</note> becauſe of its weak and obſcure Entitie, by which it comes near to a Non-beeing, and is the loweſt of al beeings: yet muſt we not think that it is a meer fiction of our Brains. For it is undoubtedly a real being, and indeed a ſubſtance, as appears in the l. <hi>Of Ariſtotles Phyſicks Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>Text.</hi> 52. <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. <hi>Text,</hi> 79. <hi>In the Second de Anima. Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>Text.</hi> 7. <hi>In the Seventh of Metaphyſicks, Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>Text</hi> 7. For of it, and form al natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſubſtances are compounded; and it is the ſubject of Generation, and receives the formes; and it ſelf is in no other thing or ſubject. Now by ſubſtance, we do not here underſtand a compound ſubſtance, which is properly called ſubſtance, <hi>but a being</hi> as it is diſtinguſht from an accident, and oppoſed thereunto: which is <hi>two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſold: One</hi> in act, as the forme: the <hi>Other</hi> in power, as is the matter. Nor is it an incorporeal but a corporeal ſubſtance. For ſeeing of it and Form al compound bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies do conſiſt if both were incorporeal, there would then ariſe from incorporeals a corporeal compound which is abſurd. Moreover ſeeing a body of the predicament of quantity doth alwaies preſuppoſe a body of the predicament of ſubſtance; nor can a body of the predicament of quantity exiſt without a body of the predicament of ſubſtance, nor this without that: and that a body of the Predicament of ſubſtance, as ſhal be ſaid, doth immediately inhere in the firſt matter, and altogether depend thereupon: it muſt therefore needs be a body pertaining to the predicament of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. And the firſt matter hath this its eſſence of it ſelf, and as <hi>Scaliger ſaies in his</hi> 5. <hi>Exercitation,</hi> the matter by that eſſence which is proper to it ſelf, is that which it is; and in his 17. <hi>Exercitation.</hi> The matter hath its <hi>quiddity</hi> or <hi>Somwhatneſs,</hi> whereby it is ſomwhat, and differs from other things.
<note place="margin">The firſt matter hath no exiſtency of is it ſelf.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And although the matter hath an eſſence and entity proper to it ſelf, whereby it is ſomwhat different from the form: yet hath it of and by it ſelf no exiſtency, which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:35070:16"/>is proper only to a compound, which hath it from the forme: which ſeeing the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath not (which its indetermination that I may ſo ſpeak witneſes) it cannot be ſaid of it ſelf to have actual exiſtence, which is an effect of the forme, but only by the forme, which determines it, perfects it, and makes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t to be this or that. The matter therefore is altogether a meer poſſibility, that is to ſay, a certain imperfect indeterminate ſubſtance, and a rudiment of all ſorts of natural things, and which receives al its perfection and all its qualities from the form.</p>
                  <p>Yet this is thus to be underſtood, not that the matter is only a poſſibility to its own being, which it hath of it ſelf by its own Eſſence; but to this or that ſort of Being, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaies in his 17. Exercitation. Nor is it ſaid to be <hi>Apoios</hi> becauſe it hath no quality, but becauſe every forme and quality which is therein, is without and beſides its Eſſence. For, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaies, in his 61 <hi>Exercitation.</hi> The firſt matter, is one <hi>Individuum</hi> or particular being, like a lump of wax, one part whereof bears the form of a Candle, another the forme of an Image; another of a Ball, another of a Die: and the ſaid maſs may have as wel this form as that and challenges none as properly belonging to it ſelf, yet muſt it of neceſſity have alwaies ſome forme or other. Nor was the matter created by God as a certain diſtinct ſort of a natural thing, but it is rather concreate or created together with natural things, and as was ſaid it is as it were a rudiment, Beginning and part of al natural things, nor did it ever exiſt without any form but only with and under the ſame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quantity</hi> doth properly follow the Nature of Matter,
<note place="margin">The firſt matter is unlimited.</note> and is as old as it, nor can be ſeparated there from, in deed or in thought. But it is only unterminated quantity I ſpeak of, For terminated quantity doth neither follow the forme alone nor the matter alone, but both of them. For quantity of it ſelf flows from Matter (for, by means thereof al things are termed ſo great or ſo great; and it alſo is the ſubject of all mutations. Now every thing which is changed, is diviſible. <hi>Phyſ.</hi> 6. Chap. 3.36.) But not from the forme; for it of it ſelf hath no muchity, is not diviſible, only it is extended, and is ſaid to be ſo great or ſo great according to the extenſion and quantity of the Matter. But certaine bounds both external as the Figure, and internal as certaine ſorts of Quantity, do proceed from the Forme. For as it ſtreigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens the Nature of the matter, and limits it to ſome peculiar and determinate ſort of natural thing: ſo it limits the Quantity thereof, and imprints thereon, this or that ſort and Figure of Quantity. And when we ſay the Matter, is unbounded, let not any one ſo underſtand us, as that the matter either is or hath ever been without cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain limits. Nor is it ſaid in reſpect of the forme to be introduced, in which reſpect the ſeed of an Oxe, if you regard the bounds it ſhal receive from the form of an Oxe may be called a certain unlimited thing; but in reſpect of all limits, which either it hath or may have from any form whatſoever. For as the matter conſidered in it ſelf, is altogether without form; yet receives all forms, nor is ever without form: even ſo Quantity and Dimenſion of matter which follows the eſſence thereof, hath of and by it, ſelf no certain and determinate bound and Figure; yet is it fit to receive all, nor is it ever found without ſome Figure and determinate dimenſion. And thus unbounded and potential dimenſions, are in a ſubſtance corporeal, unlimited and potential, ſuch as is the Matter: but actual and determined, in a determined and perfect Body.</p>
                  <p>Out of the ſame Nature of the Matter,
<note place="margin">Theere is a two ſold potentiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the matter.</note> flowes <hi>Poſſibility,</hi> or <hi>Potentiality,</hi> which is an apitude or fitneſs to receive all Forms, and it is <hi>two fold, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niveſal</hi> and <hi>Particular. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> is the Aptitude and propenſity of the matter to receive all forms without diſtinction, and equally reſpects the two oppoſite principles, form and Privation, that is to ſay all forms a like.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                     <note place="margin">Univerſal</note> For matter, to ſpeak properly, hath no appetite to Privation, as Privation, but as another form, and privation is not deſired but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther form annexed thereto. And this is termed <hi>the firſt and indeterminate Petentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> and the Appetite of the matter, which is nothing elſe, but the inclination of the ſaid matter to receive any forme. For it is not rightly ſaid, that the matter while it is furniſhed with this form, does covet another; nor do the changes which happen, by reaſon of the matter, but by reaſon of contrary forms, nor is there in the matter any appetite of change, but only of perfection. And every part is perfected under every form, and all the matter by all the forms; As <hi>Scaliger</hi> hath it in his 61. <hi>Exercitation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:35070:16"/>
                  <p> Now this univerſal Poſſibility, or Potentiality is not the very eſſence of the firſt matter taken in the firſt ſenſe; but only a certaine accident and Natural Propriety, following the Eſſence thereof. Now no accident is eſſential to a ſubſtance. And though the matter be ſomtimes termed a Poſſibility: yet by this word is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood a Quality, but its ſubſtance, which is imperfect, and as it were incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, having only a weak kind of Being: or it may be termed a potentiality, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a ſubſtance in <hi>Poſſe,</hi> and after this manner of ſpeaking, Potentiality or Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility is uſed in ſtead of a difference, to declare its obſcure Eſſence, and which cannot be eaſily underſtood. And although alſo the matter in its firſt Notion is termed <hi>Apoios</hi> without Quality: yet may we allow ſome quality therein; but it muſt be ſuch as makes no Reſtriction or Determination of the matter, and does not reſtrain it to a certain and ſpecifick Nature, ſuch as is an univerſal Potentiality. For ſeeing the matter is therefore ſaid to be free from all Qualities and Forms, that it may receive all: and this univerſal <hi>Potentia</hi> or Aptitude, does not only not h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der but further the Reception of all Forms and Qualities; it is not to be taken from the matter. And this aptitude is as old as the matter and inſeparable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from. For ſeeing the matter by reaſon of its univerſal potentiality, hath an apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to receive al forms; and every day by Reaſon of contrary Agents, ſome forms do periſh: therefore this Appetite thereof can never be ſatisfied, and one form going away, it deſires to be perfected by another. But this ſelf ſame univerſal po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer or potentiality, is as it were of the Eſſence of matter, according to the ſecond acceptation. For in as much as the matter is a paſſive principle; this Potentiality, is as it were its form and conſtitutes the ſame. For therefore matter is termed a material principle, becauſe it hath an aptitude to ſuffer,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                     <note place="margin">Particular</note> But a <hi>Particular Potenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality,</hi> is that whereby the matter reſpects one determinate form: and this does not follow the Eſſence of the Matter, but is communicated thereto by the Agent, or the form and Qualities, which fit and determine the ſame, to receive this or that form. So the firſt matter, being furniſhed with the form of a Dog's Seed, hath no other Particular Aptitude ſave that of receiving the form of a Dog. This Aptitude is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental to the matter, whether taken in the firſt or ſecond ſenſe, and ſeparable therefrom. For when the <hi>Act</hi> comes, it periſhes; and therefore neither does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute its Eſſence, nor yet follow the ſame as an eſſential Accident. For the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, both as it is a being, and as it is a principle of things ſubſiſts without it. For before it received, for examples ſake, this Particular Form of a Lyon, the Matter was actually in being, and when it ſhall have laid it down, it will remain in actual being. Seeing therefore this Determinate and Particular power or Potentiality, is not one alone, but many according to the variety of Forms, and the matter may exiſt without any one of them: none of them conſtitutes its Eſſence, or properly follows the ſame: moreover nothing Definite or Determinate does conſtitute its Eſſence; or can depend thereon. Poſſibility indeed or potentiality as ſuch does immediately depend upon the Eſſence of the Matter, and is an eſſential accident or adjunct thereof: but in as much as it is definite, and reſpects this peculiar Form, it is not from the Matter, but from the the Agent and preſent Form, which is a priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Form to be introduced. And therefore it is not as old as the matter, but is ſeparate therefrom (as hath been ſaid) when the Act comes, it is ſeparated. This Particular power or poſſibility, is only oppoſed to the Act, as Privation is to the Habit: the univerſal is not oppoſed thereunto. For <hi>that</hi> does not reſpect any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Form: but an infinite multitude of them.</p>
                  <p>And this is the Doctrine of the Peripateticks concerning the firſt matter: yet not different from the Tenets of the Platoniſts, as we may ſee in <hi>Alcinous</hi> in his Book <hi>de Dectrina Platonis</hi> Chap. 8. in theſe words. <hi>He</hi> (viz. Plato) <hi>cals the Matter, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle, Nurſe, Mother, Place, and Subject of all things; and he ſaies that it is felt without ſenſe, and comprehended by a baſtard kind of reaſoning. He wil have it to be the property of matter, to receive al Generations, and like a Nurſe to cheriſh them alſo to receive all formes, ſeeing it ſelf of its own nature is void of all Quality. Form and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure. Alſo he ſaies that it is ſprinkled and figured with ſhapes, like a Picture, having of it ſelf no Figure or Quality. Nor were it a ſubject fitly prepared for ſundry impreſſions of forms, unleſs it were quite void of all thoſe Qualities, which it is to receive. For we ſee thoſe that would make ſweet ointments of Oyl do ſeek for Oyl infected with no ſmel at all: and thoſe who would print forms upon Wax, or Clay, de firſt work &amp; ſmooth &amp; poliſh the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:35070:17"/>matter, til the old figures are quite blotted out. For it is fit that the univerſal matter, if it be to receive all forms, ſhould not have in it ſelf the nature of any of them, but that without all Quality and Figure, it muſt be the ſubject of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> ſorts of things. And being ſuch as is ſaid, it is neither a Body, nor yet incorporeal, but potentially a Body, even as Braſs is potentially a Statue, becauſe receiving the figure it may become a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>other</hi> Principle of Generation is <hi>Privation.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Privation and Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion how they differ.</note> That we may underſtand what that is, we muſt ſee how it differs from negation. For Negation is of larger extent than Privation, and is attributed to matter taken in the firſt ſenſe, and denotes an univerſal Abſence of all forms and Qualities in the matter. But ſuch is not privati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: (for one Privation is not oppoſed to all forms, but to every one a proper) but it agrees to matter taken in the ſecond ſenſe, and alwaies preſuppoſes other Qualities, and is neceſſarily conjoyned with ſome form, which goes next be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Form to be introduced. For the Privation of the form of Wheat, is not an univerſal negation of all formes in the firſt Matter, nor yet every other abſence thereof, as for example ſake, that which is in Iron: for Wheat is not generated of Iron: but that which acompanies ſome definite and determinate form, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the grain of Wheat. Hence <hi>Themiſtius</hi> upon <hi>Ariſtotles Poſtertora,</hi> writes thus; Privation is a Negation in a determined ſubject, and <hi>Alexander de Ales</hi> upon the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphiſicks; Privation eſſentially requires the Negation of a form with an aptitude to receive the ſame. And the very ſame <hi>Scaliger</hi> affirms in his 18. <hi>Exercitation.</hi> Privation (ſaies he) ſeems to have the Nature of a certain Being. For it is the ſame after a ſort with that Habit, which is contrary to the Habit, whereof it is a privation. And therefore as <hi>Zabarella</hi> ſaies; Privation is in its own nature, the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a form, and it is nothing, and is oppoſed to a form only Privatively, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as another form alwaies accompanies the ſame, in which reſpect the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of that thing is properly ſaid to be ſome poſitive thing having contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety thereunto.
<note place="margin">What Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is?</note> We gather therefore from the Premiſes; that <hi>Privation</hi> is the Abſence of a form in that Matter which is immediately diſpoſed to receive the ſame. Now Prvation is not of the Eſſence of Matter, but an accident thereof being taken in the ſeond ſenſe,
<note place="margin">It is not of the Eſſence of Matter.</note> being neceſſary, not ſimply, but in reſpect of Generation. For it concurs with other Principles to the Generation of a thing; and it is in Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as it were the term from which the motion is made. For that which is generated, was not before; yet it was poſſible, and in generation not being goes before Being: and therefore it is called a third Principle eſſentially diſtinct from matter: and matter concurs <hi>one</hi> way to Generation: Privation <hi>another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>third</hi> Principle of natural things we make to be the <hi>Form,</hi> which becauſe it is the moſt excellent of all,
<note place="margin">The Form</note> it requires more diligent conſideration. That there is ſomwhat in things beſides the Matter, called Form, all in a manner do grant: but what that is, whether a Subſtance or an Accident, all are not agreed. For there were both Phyloſophers of old, and ſome there are at this day, who conceive there is no ſubſtantial form in the matter. Yet verily, that is the truer opinion which ſaies that there is in every natural thing, beſides the matter, ſome ſubſtantial form, which is naturally before all the accidents or adjuncts, both common and proper. For the Parts of a Subſtance, are themſelves alſo ſubſtances. And if things did conſiſt only of matter, the Eſſence and operation of all things, would be one and the ſame, and there would be no true diſtinction betwixt them. For from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents a true diverſity and diſtinction of Eſſence and Operations cannot be drawn. For the Act and eſſential perfection of a thing, whence its difference is taken, does belong to the ſame kind, wherein the thing is placed: or as <hi>Toletus</hi> ſaies, No imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect thing in any kind is pefected in that kind, ſave by ſomwhat of that kind. Since therfore Matter is an imperfect Subſtance, and is perfected in the compound; it muſt be perfected by another Subſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> The Form. Moreover, the diverſity of Accidents and Operations, whence proceeds it? Why is the fire not cold, but hot? not by reaſon of the matter: for that operates nothing, makes no diſtinction, but is void of al Quality. Therefore we muſt preſuppoſe ſomthing more noble than an accident.
<note place="margin">The form is of its ſelf an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal Subſtance</note> Finally, if the Form were an Accident, there would be no Generation of any thing, but only an alteration.</p>
                  <p>The Form therefore is a Subſtance of it ſelf; and indeed incorporeal; of it ſelf void of all Quantity, Demenſion and Diviſion. But it participates of Quantity by
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:35070:17"/>Accident, <hi>viz.</hi> inaſmuch as it is inherent in the Matter, according to the extenſion and diviſion whereof, it is extended and becomes diviſible. For as the matter is not, ſo neither is the form perfect of it ſelf, nor conſtitutes any ſort of natural things; but it concurs together with the matter, to make up the compound. And therefore neither the matter nor the form, hath of it ſelf all things requiſite to make the compound; but each wants the others help, and they mutually aſſiſt one another. The form wants the matter to ſuſtain it; and therefore ſome call the Matter <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipuum Subjectivum formae,</hi> the Principle of the form, or that Principle wherein the form reſides; upon which the form depend in its making and conſervation. But the matter is perfected by the form and from it receives its actual being and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and therefore ſome call the form, the formal Principle of the matter; not becauſe it gives it its Eſſence, but becauſe it perfects the ſame. The whol nature ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the Form conſiſts herein, that by a real conjunction with the matter, it may give it that perfection which is proper thereunto, and ſo with it conſtitute the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound. And therefore it is by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the ſecond of his Phyſicks Chap. 3. Text 8. defined to be, <hi>That which makes a thing to be what it is,</hi> and in his 6. Book of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſicks Chap. 8. I cal the form that which makes a thing to be what it is, and the firſt Eſſence of a thing; and in the 6. of his Metaphy licks Chap. 11. <hi>For the form is the inward ſubſtance of a thing, from which a ſo the whol matter is called a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</hi> For the form is a ſimple ſubſtantial Act, with the matter making one entire compound. For this is the end of Generation; by it the matter is perfected; it is coveted by the matter; herein the matter finds it ſelf contented; from it al acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and actions flow.</p>
                  <p>But, <hi>Concerning the original of Formes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of Forms.</note> there is a very great controverſie amongſt Phyloſophers, which hath exerciſed the Brains of the moſt able amongſt them; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or ſeems it as yet ſufficiently determined whence the forms have their Original. For though <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and his Expoſitors do ſay, That neither the matter is genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor the form, but the compound yet their Intent is not, that both the matter and the form are generated at one and the ſame time (for the matter is not genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor can be) or that ſome third thing different from theſe is produced; but this they would ſignifie: that the form is not produced by it ſelf apart from the matter and without it, and afterward joyned thereto; but that it is produced in the matter and joyned therewith. For the compound is nothing but the matter and form joyned. Therefore we muſt grant that in ſome ſort the form is made, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it is the Burt and End of Generation.</p>
                  <p>This being granted we muſt ſee <hi>Whence the forms have their original.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Whence the forms pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed?</note> If you ſhal ask a Peripatetick or follower of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (ſetting aſide at this time the Opinions of <hi>Anaxagoras Plato,</hi> and <hi>Avicenna</hi>) He wil tel you they are drawn out of the Aptitude or Potentiallity of the matter. I hear indeed (to uſe the words of <hi>Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> in his 61. exercitution) the found of words; but I deſire ſomthing to ſatisfie my mind: but I hear nothing. For though this expreſſion be worn thredbare by many yet few do ſufficiently explain what we are to underſtand thereby. But this ſeems to be the opinion of thoſe who do think moſt rightly:
<note place="margin">What it is for forms to be drawn out of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the matter.</note> for forms (excepting the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Soul) to be drawn out of the power of the matter, is nothing elſe, but for them to be ſo made in a ſubject having a natural aptitude unto them, and exiſting before them both in time and nature, as that both in reſpect of their conſervation and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, they do ſo depend thereupon, that out of it they neither can be made, nor preſerved, nor operate. For the form which is educed, is not at firſt produced apart from the matter, and out of it, and afterwards externally adjoyned to the matter, but it is produced in the matter. And ſo <hi>two</hi> things are required to the eduction of forms: <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Subject have a natural aptitude to the form: <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the form which is drawn forth, depend upon the matter both in their making and conſervation; that is to ſay, that without the help of the ſubject, and out of it, it can neither be produced, nor preſerved, nor operate. And conſequently al natural forms, except the humane, do ſo depend upon the matter, that out of it, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aſſiſtance thereof, they cannot be.</p>
                  <p>But if any man, not content with what hath been ſaid, ſhal further urge, and ſay,
<note place="margin">Whether the Form be made of nothing in the matter.</note> that he acknowledges what hath been ſaid to be true, <hi>viz.</hi> that for a form to be drawn out of the aptitude of the matter, is nothing elſe, but for a form to be made in the matter, and not out of the ſame: but ſhal yet enquire; whether in the matter,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:35070:18"/>Form is made abſolutely of nothing. Which <hi>Picolomineus</hi> ſeems to conceive in his 1. <hi>Book of Creation Chap.</hi> 7. So that the Agent affords nothing of its own Eſſence thereunto, but action only; or ſo as that the Agent does not communicate the Forme it ſelf, but brings the Aptitude of the matter to ſuch a Form into Act, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Potentiality of the matter to break out into a formal Act. But whether a new Form comes out of the Eſſence of the old Form, is an hard queſtion to anſwer.</p>
                  <p>For ſeeing naturally,
<note place="margin">The Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of the forms from whence it is?</note> nothing is made of nothing, and a Form is now in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which was not there before, the Queſtion wil be, whence is its Original? How the Interpreters of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> do torment themſelves, about this point is every where to be ſeen, and among the reſt out of <hi>Teletus</hi> in his Comments upon the 1. of <hi>Phiſicks</hi> Chap. 9. queſt. 19. and upon the firſt <hi>de Generat.</hi> and <hi>Corrup.</hi> Chap. 3. Queſt. 2. where he reckons ſundry opinions of the Peripetaticks in this point. For in the firſt place, ſome mentioned by <hi>Du-Rand</hi> in his 2. <hi>B.</hi> upon the Sentences D. 18. did hold, that there did precede in the matter certain Entities, out of which afterward the Forms were made, <hi>viz.</hi> ſeveral forms out of the ſeveral Entities, and theſe Entities or Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, they called Poſſibilities of Forms. Secondly, Others think, that the parts of the forms precede in the matter, but very remiſs, and that afterward they are in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration vigorated and that ſo every form is precedent in the matter, in a weak man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Being. Thirdly, <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> held, that al forms did eſſentially precede in the matter, ſo the that Matter is a kind of habit prepoſſeſſing al forms eſſentially.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Toletus</hi> acknowledges the Abſurdity of theſe opinions, and therefore he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines, that there was nothing of the form in the matter, which did precede the introduction thereof; and this he proves by firm reaſons which you may ſee in the forecited place.</p>
                  <p>Others that they may avoid theſe abſurdities, do attribute this power to the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, and ſome with <hi>Plato</hi> make the Ideas to be the efficient Cauſes of the Forms: and others ſince have brought in the Soul of the world to that intent: <hi>Avicenna</hi> hath invented a tenth Intelligence, whom in his own language he cal's <hi>Cholchodea,</hi> &amp; gives him this office of making forms. <hi>Fernelius</hi> with ſome others makes the Heaven to be the efficient cauſe of forms. But if that were ſo, Generation would not be univocal, and the form not having been in the matter, muſt be held to be created. Howbeit that does not pleaſe other peripetaticks. Wherefore <hi>Piccolimineus</hi> in his 2. <hi>B.</hi> of the Principles of Natural things, although he grant, that the form is in part made out of nothing, becauſe nothing of it was before in the matter; yet he denies that it is created, becauſe it preſuppoſes a Subject, out of which it is educed. But <hi>Tolet.</hi> in his 1. <hi>de Gener. &amp; Cor.</hi> ſees that this anſwer, which was alſo <hi>Marſilius Ficinus</hi> his anſwer, wil not hold, and therefore he writes: This Doctrine does not pleaſe me. For verily if the production be of the form it ſelf, ſeeing no part thereof was precedent in the matter, it muſt be called a Creation. And the truth is, whether the form be produced in the matter or out of it, if there were nothing thereof prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, it muſt be a Creation; which himſelf acknowledges ought not to be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to natural agents.</p>
                  <p>He therefore, to free himſelf from this difficulty, determines: that what is firſt generated and corrupted is the compound; and that the form is not produced by it ſelf, but comproduced and made together with the production of the compound, and that the Action is firſt terminated upon the compound it ſelf and conſequently and as it were by accident upon the form.</p>
                  <p>But in very deed, whether the Form be made in the firſt or ſecond place, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, whether alone or with the compound, the Queſtion remains juſt as it was; <hi>viz.</hi> Whence the form, which now is in the matter and before was not hath its Eſſence; whether it did praeexiſt in the matter, or was made by converſion of matter into form, or of nothing. For it does not follow that if the ſinger be made with the hand it is therfore made of nothing. Yea the compound ſhould rather be ſaid to be made conſequently and in the ſecond place, than the form. For as whiles Wood, Bricks, Morter and other things are made and compounded, an Houſe is conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made: even ſo a natural compound, which is nothing elſe but matter and form, is made, when the Matter and Form is made. And ſeeing the matter is not made, what elſe ſhal ſhal we ſay is made except the Form. And therefore when he obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that he neither ſatisfied himſelf nor others; and ſaw that no part of the form
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:35070:18"/>did preexiſt in the matter, nor could a power of creating be attributed to Natural Agents; at length in his 1. <hi>de Gener. and Cor. Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. He concludes: I confeſs this is an admirable power and Virtue, which partakes ſomwhat of a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting power: but it is no ſuch creating power: ſeeing it hath alwaies ſubjects to work upon. Alſo the Virtue of the matter is wonderful, out of the Aptitude whereof things are produced, which actually are not there. But in very truth, that virtue is not wonderful, becauſe there is none ſuch, but their wilfulneſs is wonderful, who will have that to be drawn out of the matter, which is impoſſible, as not being in the power either of the matter or of the Agent. For many men had rather reſt upon certain principles, which cannot ſatisfie minds covetous of the truth, then make profeſſion of that which is the manifeſt and ſolid truth. Which they perhaps therefore do that they may be thought good Phyloſophers: whereas, doubt leſs, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> if he had known the firſt and true Original of Forms, and the Creation of the world, as we do, he would have left us, a Natural Phyloſophy better and more complext then he hath done.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore to whom theſe things are made known out of the holy Scriptures, omitting thoſe opinions, which endeavour to bring the Forms out of the matter, or from Heaven, or from elſewhere, determine that the Forms themſelves, as alſo the matter, were at the beginning of the world created with the things themſelves, that of them all Natural things might conſiſt: And that the firſt matter cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be generated but that by means of the Forms, all changes of generation do happen, and that the Forms are the ſecond principle of Natural things, by which they are that which they are, and do that which they are commanded to do; that according to the Forms al Naturul thin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s do not only act, according to their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that is to ſay, as the creator hath commanded them to act but thereby they are governed, preſerved and propagated. For God commanded, that natural things ſhould not only exiſt by their Forms, but propagate themſelves thereby, and as he commanded it, ſo he gave every of them a power to do ſo as he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and forthwith to encreaſe and multiply which command of God (that no man may bring the Forms out of Heaven) appears to have been given out before the Heaven was created. <hi>Geneſis,</hi> 1. verſe, 11 and 12. <hi>And God ſaid let the Earth bring forth Graſs, the Herb yeilding Seed and the Fruit tree yeilding Fruit after his kind whoſe Seed is in it ſelf upon the Earth: and it was ſo. For the Earth brought forth Graſs, and the Herb yeilding Seed after his kind and the Tree yeilding Fruit, whoſe Seed was in it ſelf, after his kind: and God ſaw that it was good.</hi> All Natural things do therefore obey the command of the Creator, and al Forms, as in the firſt creation by a power put into them, do beget by promotion and propagation of themſelves; they remaining nevertheleſs in the mean while entire; which alſo we ſee in Plants and Animals, which generate by Seed. For they when they afford Seed do afford ſomwhat of their matter and ſomwhat of their form. For the Seed of a plant while it is in the plant, is animated with the Soul of the plant. But when it is ſeparated therefrom, that portion of the Form, which is Inherent in the Seed, and together with the matter, of the Seed Is ſeparate from the Plant, grows into a plant like to that from whence it came. And the ſame holds in Animals. And therefore the Form is Potentially in the Seed; becauſe as <hi>Scaligar</hi> ſaies <hi>in his</hi> 6. <hi>Exercitation, Sect.</hi> 5. The Seed is able to give the Form: it is therefore drawn out of a remote poſſibility, which is the firſt act, to a near poſſibility, which is the Second Act. So that the Form is in the ſame matter, after the ſame manner as, to need no helps, but to enjoy its End and to which the whol compound is ordained: which is then brought to paſs, when the Form does conſtitute its own matter, and Alter, Labor and diſpoſe it as if it were its Houſe. And therefore when a living Creature is made of the Seed, the Form is not then firſt induced thereinto, but exiſts therein already being communicated by the Ingenderer, and it does only by aſſiſtance of the wombs Heat diſplay it ſelf; which is rather a certain ariſing or ſpringing out, then a drawing out. To be ſhort: This is common to all Forms (though to ſome in a more noble, others in a more inferior degree) that they can multiply themſelves, are incorporeal, have of themſelves no dimenſion or Quantity, nor do of their own Nature take up, but do fil. And if we ſuppoſe the Body of any Animal or Plant to grow never ſo big, yet the ſame Form without any Addition will fil it all: and though it be never ſo much leſſened, the Form is no waies leſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:35070:19"/>or impaired. But let us conclude this diſcourſe with the words of <hi>Scaliger</hi> in his 307 <hi>Exercitation, Sect.</hi> 29. <hi>The matter is a poſſibility, apt to be perfected: the Form is an Act, fit to perfect. And thus we ſee the ſhallowneſs of mans underſtanding, who is ſo bold as to ſay be knows the Forms of ſubſtances. But this exquiſite knowledg is hid from our Eyes:</hi> viz. <hi>How of two things, one is made. How the Form is totally in the whol and in every part of the compound. So divine a thing is the Form, that being a ſubſtance, it fils another ſubſtance ſo ful of it ſelf, that of both one is made. Wherefore to ſearch further, is the part of an overcurious and buſie mind. For it is a part of Mans Wiſdom, to be willingly ignorant of ſomethings.</hi> Yet we muſt not reject as falf, ſuch things as are hard to be known. For (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaies in his Dialogue called <hi>Theaetetus</hi>) <hi>they are profane who think there is nothing, but what they can feel and handle.</hi>

                  <p>THere are ſundry Significations of the word Nature,
<note place="margin">Divers ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Term Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> which you may ſee in <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle, in the</hi> 5. <hi>of his Metaphyſicks, Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>And in</hi> Pererius, <hi>in the 7. of his Phyſick, Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>In</hi> Piccolomineus, <hi>in the</hi> 2. <hi>of his Phyſicks,</hi> p. 249. <hi>In</hi> Fonſeca, <hi>in the 5. of his Metaphyſicks, Chap.</hi> 4. I ſhal cite only ſome which are moſt ſuitable to our preſent matter in hand. And in the firſt place, ſome cal God himſelf by the name of Nature. Again, others take Nature for the ſecond Cauſes; in which ſenſe <hi>Scaliger, in his</hi> 188. <hi>Exercit. and</hi> 359. <hi>Sect.</hi> 11. ſeems to define it to be the ordinary power of God. Thirdly, Nature ſignifies the whol Univerſe of things. Fourthly, Nature is taken for the Eſſence of every thing; in which ſenſe we ſay that things ſeparate from matter, as God and Angels have a Nature, that is to ſay an Eſſence. Fiftly, Natural is oppoſed to voluntary, ſo that a thing which acts without deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration is called Natural; and that which acts with Deliberation, Voluntary. And yet more ſtrictly, Natural is oppoſed to Animate, and Nature is taken for a Faculty oppoſite to the knowing Faculty. For ſeeing the knowing Faculty reſpects both parts of the oppoſition, and is apt to do as wel this as that contrary: Nature, contrariwiſe, is ſaid to be that which reſpects but one contrary and is only determined thereunto. Finally, in a certain middle way, betwixt theſe laſt ſignifications, Nature is ſaid to be the internal principle of motion; and every thing is ſaid to be Natural which is mutable and variable. And in this place we treat of it, in this laſt ſignification: and that we may the better find out what it is, let us ſee how Natural things differ from things Artificial.</p>
                  <p>All things in the whol Univerſe are of two kinds: ſome are from Nature, as the Elements,
<note place="margin">Things Natural and Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial how they differ</note> Living-Creatures and their Parts, Plants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſome again are from other Cauſes, as Art, Counſel, Fortune, Chance. And although things Natural differ from Artificial many waies, as may be ſeen in <hi>Pererius, Lib. 7. Phyſ. Chap.</hi> 2. Yet this difference ſhal ſerve our tutn: that Natural things have an inward Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their motion and reſt: But Artificial things, as ſuch, and of themſelves, have no ſuch principle. For whereas a Statue or Image tends downwards, it does it not as a Statue: But as conſiſting of Stone or Wood. Since therefore Natural things are hereby differenced from Artificial,
<note place="margin">The defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of Nature.</note> Nature is not unfitly defined to be <hi>the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Motion and reſt in that thing wherein it is primarily, of it ſelf, and not by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But before we paſs to other things, that this definition may be rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, ſome things are to be hinted. And in the firſt place you muſt obſerve, how Nature is ſaid to be the principle of Motion and Reſt. For it is not ſo to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as if Nature did effect both theſe together: but one after another. Nor as if there were the cauſe of both in every Natural thing. For every nature is not the principle of Motion and Reſt. But it is thus to be underſtood, that all things which naturally move and reſt, have this motion and reſt from nature. For there are ſome things that alwaies reſt; ſome which are alwaies moved; ſome which both reſt and are moved, and yet nature is the Cauſe of al theſe. Moreover, this is not to be forgot; that every nature is not the principle of every motion, but this of that, and another of another; nor is every natural body moved with all motions.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:35070:19"/>And by Reſt we do not underſtand every Ceſſation from motion, and every priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof: but to reſt, is to remain in its Natural place. So Earth, when it comes to its place, it hath a Principle whereby it Naturally reſts therein, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves not therefrom unleſs by violence forced. And whereas in the Definition it is ſaid, that Nature is a principle of motion and reſt, in that wherein it is; thereby, Nature is ſeparated from Art and from an external Agent, which are the Cauſes of a Tranſient operation only. Yet, I deny not but that Nature is the cauſe of a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient Action. For Fire heates alſo other things. Howbeit, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> would define Nature, only by an immanent Action, becauſe thereby it is manifeſtly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from Art. And if the definition of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> be ſo explained, that Nature is the internal principle, from which every thing hath a power of acting and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and ceaſing from both; al ſeeming difficulties wil be cleared up.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe the principle of Motion is twofold, one Active,
<note place="margin">A two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſold prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal of motion active and paſſive. IThe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive what?</note> by which the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is effected, another paſſive, Wherein? hereuupon ariſes a double controverſie amongſt Authors. Firſt what we are to underſtand by a paſſive Principle: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, whether Nature be both theſe Principles or only one of them. As to the Firſt, a paſſive Principle may be underſtood two manner of waies, Firſt for the paſſive Aptitude of things oppoſite which is free, and not more apt to receive of it ſelf, one motion more then another, but is equally propenſe to both: Secondly, For a power already reſtrained, and limited, to one only of the Oppoſites, and Determined to one Motion, which is ſaid to be the Natural motion of the thing. I am of the latter opinion: for from the former, this abſurdity ſeems to follow that all violent and Artificial motions, may be called Natural; ſeeing the firſt matter is of it ſelf a like diſpoſed to receive all Motions.</p>
                  <p>As to the other Controverſie:
<note place="margin">Nature is a principle as wel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive as paſſive.</note> although ſome have ſaid that Nature is only an active principle, others that it is only a paſſive; Yet I conceive, both may well be affirmed of Nature. For to things having Nature in them, it is no leſs Natural to move themſelves, then to be moved by themſelves.</p>
                  <p>And from what hath been ſaid it is now apparent what is Nature in things, <hi>viz.</hi> The principle of motion and reſt, both active and paſſive.
<note place="margin">To what things the term Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may be applied.</note> It remaines that we now declare, what that is, and to what things the name of Nature is due. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> gives the name of Nature both to the matter and the Form: and that not amiſs, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he be rightly underſtood. For the Form alone primarily and of it ſelf deſerves to be called Nature: and it is a Principle of motion as well active as paſſive.
<note place="margin">The Form is cheifly Nature.</note> But becauſe the matter is indifferent and doubtful, diſpoſed to receive contrary moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, reſpecting no determinate motion, but al indifferently: it cannot primarily and properly be called nature. For ſo, as all natural things have one matter, ſo ſhould there be of all but one Nature: whereas nevertheleſs every thing hath its own peculiar Nature. Yea, if ſo be the matter as well as the Form were Nature, every thing ſhould have two Natures. Nor is it abſurd to cal the Form a paſſive principle. For ſeeing, as hath been ſaid, a paſſive principle, is not ſo called, in reſpect of every indeterminate motion; but only of that determinat and certain motion, which is peculiar and natural to every thing: by very good right, the Form alſo is called a paſſive principle; ſince from it proceeds al determination and reſtraint of matter to the reception of certaine determinate Motions. Now the Form is termed a paſſive principle, in as much as it is in the matter (for in reſpect of the matter every thing is ſaid to ſuffer) and determinates the Nature thereof: and in as much as it is the Form, it is alſo termed an active principle. The matter, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding as hath been ſaid is alſo called nature: not becauſe it is nature of it ſelf; but only potentially: or becauſe it hath an aptitude to receive the Form, which of it ſelf is Nature. Actually therefore the Form is nature; potentially the matter.</p>
                  <p>The whol Sum therefore of this diſcourſe is this: One thing hath one nature, which properly and primarily is called the Form. For this of its ſelf is the active principle in things, and in as much as it is the Form: and alſo the paſſive, in as much as it determines the doubtful nature of the matter. And therefore to be a paſſive principle, is in divers reſpects attributed both to the matter and the Form. For the matter is the Paſſive principle, not as it is barely the matter but in as much as it is furniſhed with ſome Form, whereby it is determined to receive ſome particular motion. The Form is a paſſive principle, not as it is the Form, but as it determines
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:35070:20"/>the doubtful nature of the Matter. And thus neither of them without the others aſſiſtance, can be called a paſſive principle.</p>
                  <p>From what hath been ſaid,
<note place="margin">Whether e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Form informing be Nature</note> it may eaſily be collected, what may be determined in reference to that controverſie, Whether every form in forming, is to be counted Nature, or not. The Definition, truly, of Nature doth evince: that every form in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming, inaſmuch as it is inherent in the matter, and informs the ſame, may right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be called Nature.</p>
                  <p>It is now manifeſt what and what kind of thing Nature is.
<note place="margin">Things natural &amp; according to nature, how they differ.</note> One thing muſt yet be added: What that thing is which hath Nature, and what that is which is according to Nature. Natural things are Subſtances which have nature in them, <hi>viz.</hi> A princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of motion and of reſt. Such are only natu al Bodies. For that thing is not called natural, which produces any thing that is natural; for ſo God himſelf ſhould be reckoned amongſt natural things. Nor is that ſaid to be natural, which is produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by naturral motion; for ſo the firſt Man and this whol world ſhould not be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural. But that thing is properly natural, which hath an implanted Principle of its motion and reſt. And ſuch a definition of a natural Body, does comprehend all bodies both Celeſtial and ſublunary. But according to nature, is of larger extent, than having Nature, or Natural; for according to nature, are not only the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, but alſo their properties, and their affections or adjuncts which follow their Nature. <hi>And ſo much of Natur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> may ſuffice to be ſaid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But inaſmuch as nature is chiefly conſidered in this place, as it is referred to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or, as they ſay, it hath a peculiar Cauſality over the motion and reſt of that thing wherein it is: the <hi>Cauſes</hi> are now to be explained, <hi>viz.</hi> inaſmuch as they have reſpect to motion; and we are to conſider what kinds of Cauſes have place in things natural.
<note place="margin">What a Cauſe is, and how many cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes there are?</note> They define a <hi>Cauſe</hi> to be that by the virtue or efficacy whereof any thing is made: or by which any thing is of it ſelf produced. Now they are four: The Matter, of which a thing is made and ſubſiſts: The Form, by which a thing is that which it is, and nothing elſe: The Efficient, whence proceeds the Beginning of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or Reſt: The End for the ſake whereof a thing is. Nor is there need to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent more Cauſes; ſeeing by theſe we can ſufficiently Anſwer any Queſtion, why a thing is,
<note place="margin">The Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Cauſes.</note> and whereby the cauſe thereof is demanded. Yet there are more Modes or manners of Cauſes. For a Cauſe is neer or remote: of it ſelf or by accident; in act or in aptitude, ſimple or conjunct, of which ſee <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his 3. of <hi>Phyſicks Chap.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>To Cauſes by Accident,
<note place="margin">Fortune &amp; Chance, how they differ?</note> Fortune and Chance are referred. For ſeeing ſome things are made alwaies or for the moſt part, others ſeldom; again ſome are made for ſome ends ſake, others for none: and thoſe which are made for an end, are made either by Election or without Election: Fortune and Chance are ſaid to be the Cauſes of ſuch things as happen ſeldom &amp; without an end propounded. And herein Fortune and Chance agree, that they are both the Cauſe of ſuch things, which are not alwaies or for the moſt part, but ſeldom effected, and which are undertaken for ſome Ends ſake. Yet herein they differ, that Fortune is of things done with Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and Chaunce of things done without Election.</p>
                  <p>Fortune therefore is the Cauſe by accident of theſe things,
<note place="margin">What For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune is, and what Chance?</note> which among things done by Election and for ſome end, do not alwaies nor frequently but ſeldom hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. And in ſuch a ſenſe we may grant, that there is both Fortune and Chaunce in things. But in reſpect of the moſt great and good God, nothing happens by chaunce or by fortune.</p>
                  <p>But it is the part of a natural Phyloſopher to conſider all the four kinds of Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<note place="margin">Whether it belong to a natural Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher to conſider the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes?</note> and by all four anſwer may be made to that queſtion why or how a thing comes to be, and that phyſically. For it is the part of a Phyſitian or natural phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, to conſider the Parts and Principles of a body natural. And to him it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, to explain the mutation and generation of things and their cauſes; and to ſee for what things ſake, the Efficient acts, or to enquire into the end: moreover to weigh and conſider what is made, or what form is introduced afterwards, to know what that is which ſuffers and receives the form, <hi>viz.</hi> the matter, finally to ſearch out the efficient which introduces the form.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit we are to know, that the three Cauſes, Efficient, Form, and End, are in natural things many times united together, and grow into one Cauſe: ſo that the form and end, though they differ in definition, yet in number
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:35070:20"/>and ſubject they are one Cauſe: but the formal and efficient cannot be one in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, yet one in kind. For the ſame form of an animal, is at the ſame time both the form and end: the form in reſpect of the thing Generated, inaſmuch as it is an act perfecting the matter, and therewith making up the compound: but an end in reſpect of the Generation. For it is the Butt to which nature rends, and wherein ſhe reſts contented after it is attained. Moreover the ſame form is alſo the Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, inaſmuch as the thing generated, is of the ſame ſpecies or ſort with the, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator.</p>
                  <p>This thing alſo is to be noted, after what manner every cauſe, does concur to the Production of the Effect. The End concurs to the production of the Effect no otherwiſe than as it moves the Efficient to produce the ſame, and after the thing is effected, all the cauſality thereof ceaſes. The Efficient concurs ſomtimes only to the production of the Effect, and ſomtimes alſo to the conſervation or preſervation thereof; which latter efficiency does chiefly belong to the univerſal Cauſes, which <hi>Scaliger</hi> does excellently ſhew, in his 28. <hi>Exercitation. It is not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>neceſſary, that the particular efficient Cauſes ſhould be perpetuated together with their Effects: but then only to ſtick to them when they work. For it is enough that they give them their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>orm, whereby not only they are, but are preſerved: ſince out of their matter the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies being driven by their contrary, the form alſo is forced away. Only the firſt Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, becauſe he is Lord of Eternity and the world, accompanies his effects: there is no neceſſity that other Efficients ſhould do ſo: no not the Heavens themſelves, otherwiſe than by his favor and Indulgence.</hi> So far <hi>Scaliger</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Matter and Form are neceſſary both for the Production, Conſtitution and Conſervation of the thing.</p>
                  <p>And although there were anciently, ſome who thought all things were made at random and by hap hazard: yet we avouch that God and Nature do nothing in Vain. Yet we do not here introduce a ſimple Neceſſity, but only a conditional, and therefore we do not deny all Contingency in natural things.</p>
                  <p>Many things might be added touching the Cauſes; but all that may be ſaid of them, belongs not to our preſent Purpoſe, alſo I endeavor to be as brief as may be. Only one Queſtion we ſhall here diſcuſs, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Whether an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent can produce a Subſtance?</note> Whether an accident can produce a Subſtance. There are about this Point Three Opinions. The firſt is of ſome late Writers who aver, that an accident by its own proper Virtue can produce a Subſtance? ſo that when Fire produces fire, that whol production intrinſecally and effectively proceeds from Heat, nor does the ſubſtantial form which is in the fire concur to the effect. The ſecond, is the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Scotus, Ocham,</hi> and <hi>Du-Rand,</hi> who teach, that Accidents can neither by their own proper Virtue, nor the power of ſubſtantial forms, produce a ſubſtance: but that a ſubſtance is immediately produced by a Subſtance. The third is the opinion of <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> who avers: That accidents do not produce a ſubſtance by their own proper force, but by the power &amp; virtue of the ſubſtantial forms, whoſe virtues and Inſtruments they are. This laſt opinion ſeems to me moſt probable. For that ſubſtances act mediately, any body may hereby learn, inaſmuch as the things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween which there is action and paſſion, are many times, we ſee, in ſeveral places: whereas, nevertheleſs a mutual contract betwixt the Agent and Patient is neceſſary, and the Agent and Patient ought to be together. And that Accidents cannot of themſelves produce a ſubſtance, does hence appear; in that whatſoever is in the effect, does praeexiſt in the efficient cauſe. For nothing give; that which it ſelf hath not, either formally or eminently, as they ſay.</p>

                  <p>NOthing is more intimately inherent in a natural Body than Quantity; as being of equal durance with the firſt Matter, and altogether inſeperable therefrom, and by help whereof, all the remaining Accidents do adhere to the Matter Yea and by a Body in the predicament of Quantity, we come to the knowldg of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Body, which is nothing but a ſubſtance that hath three dimenſions of Length, Breadth, and Thickneſs. For theſe differ one from another, like Subſtance and Accident. In Subject they are one. For that Body which conſiſts of Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:35070:21"/>is not without a ſubſtantial Body: but they differ eſſentially, having different eſſences, when no man thinks of them.</p>
                  <p>Now continued Quantity is that whereof we cheifly treat in this place;
<note place="margin">What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Quantity is &amp; how in a yield. A <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And there are three ſorts thereof; a Line, a Surface, and a Body, each of which hath its pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Office and Peculiar bounds. For a Line is a Longitude without Latitude, the bounds of a Surface. The bounds of a Line is a point; whoſe Nature is to continue touch, terminate. For it begins, continues and ends a Line. The Nature alſo of a Line is to continue, Touch, Terminate, and alſo to divide. For by a Line a Surface is continued, and Terminated, and by the ſame, two Surfaces, do mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touch one another: Finally by means of a Line, every thing is diviſible accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to one dimenſion,
<note place="margin">A Surface.</note> 
                     <hi>viz.</hi> Longitude. A Surface is a Quantity long and broad; by means whereof Bodies are continued, do mutually touch one another, and are divided. For by means of the Surface, a thing may be divided according to a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold dimenſion,
<note place="margin">A Body.</note> 
                     <hi>viz.</hi> Longitude and Latitude. Finally, a Body is a Quantity, Long, broad and deep. And its Office is not to continue terminate or touch; but to fil and poſſeſs, and to be apt to be divided according to its threefold dimenſions, Length, Breadth and Depth.</p>
                  <p>Thus therefore,
<note place="margin">Things poſſeſs a place only in regard of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bodily.</note> in reſpect of all dimenſions things are ſaid to have Quantity and to be diviſible: but in reſpect of a body only they poſſeſs and fil. For that two bodies cannot be together in one place, is not becauſe they are ſubſtances: For divers incorporeal ſubſtances, may be together in one and the ſame place: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have matter furniſhed with a threefold dimenſion, the Penetration whereof is impoſſible.</p>
                  <p>Here I muſt take leave to digreſs a little,
<note place="margin">To take up and fill do differ.</note> and propound ſome things not much from our purpoſe, To poſſeſs or Occupy, and to fil, is for a body to be ſo in a place, as that another cannot be in the ſame place with it: and it is proper to ſuch things as have matter of a threefold dimenſion. For ſuch things do ſo take up the whol place, that another Body at the ſame time cannot be therein. But thoſe things are ſaid to fil, which may either many of them together, or with other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, be in a certain place, ſo that the Preſence of one ſhall not hinder the preſence of another.
<note place="margin">Why two bodies cannot be in one place?</note> And therefore two bodies can never be together, nor can two hold the ſame place: and as the common experſſion is, Penetration of Dimenſions is impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſible. For Naturally it cannot be, that into that place which any of us fils, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man, or any other Body, ſhould be admitted, til we leave the ſame. But it is otherwiſe in things free from dimenſion and Matter, and in all Forms, ſubſtantial and accidental, which is manifeſtly apparent in the light of the Stars, for the lights of infin te Stars, are every where ſhed and ſpred about under the Concave of the Moon, nor d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> the Elements at all hinder them, by whom this ſpace is before poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, nor does the preſence of the one hinder the preſence of the other, nor though they are all of them in all places, are they confounded or jumbled together. The ſame we ſee in other things which give light. For if you place Looking-Glaſſes upon the walls of a chamber round about, and ſet candles in the middeſt of the ſaid Chamber. They will all ſend their image and light into all parts of the Chamber, already ful of Aire, nor will the preſence of one hinder the other, nor wil they be mixed or jumbled together: but they will all appear diſtinctly, in all the Glaſſes. So in Honey, in all parts thereof there is yellowneſs, and ſweetneſs, and ſmel and moiſture. And the ſame happens in ſubſtantial Forms. For both our Soul and the Soul of all living Creatures, does fil all the Body, which it informs, nor though a Body have before taken up the place, is it hindred from being in all parts of the Body. It is therefore the Property of things which have dimenſions and are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, to poſſeſs and take up: but of things free from dimenſions and matter, to fil: and by how much a thing is more free, from dimenſions, Matter, and bodily bulk, by ſo much the more it fils. Hence we ſee a ſound fils a greater ſpace, then a ſmel, and colors greater then ſound; and the light of fire yet a greater, and the light of the Heavenly bodies,
<note place="margin">God is preſent repletively</note> a greater then that. Finally the moſt good and great God being inſinitly free from all dimenſions and from al matter, does infinitely fil all things, yea is himſelf an infinite fulneſs, abſent from nothing, included in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, nor mixt with any thing; but is totally al the world over, and totally every where without this world. For though he is preſent with all things, yet is not
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:35070:21"/>ſome part of his plenitude preſent with one thing, another with another, but he is wholly preſent with all things. Finally this world is made in the Atome, indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible point or Centre of his fulneſs. And therefore, al things void of matter,
<note place="margin">Forms of themſelves are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity and made viſible</note> and all forms, of themſelves, have neither Quantity, nor can be divided, unleſs by accident, in as much as they are inherent in a body by whoſe dimenſions they are bounded, and may be many of them together. For dimenſions being taken away, the Form of any of us, may be with the Form of another, in the ſame place, and fil the ſaid place, nor ſhould the preſence of one hinder the preſence of another. And we ſee the ſame Form; which at firſt ſits the Body of an infant, fil the ſaid body without encreaſing it ſelf, when the infant is grown to a tall Perſon.</p>
                  <p>But let us return to Quantity:
<note place="margin">Whether that which is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed be made of indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible or of diviſible parts?</note> where we are fallen into that moſt noble queſtion which hath exerciſed the wits of ſo many renowned Men: <hi>viz.</hi> Whether a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Body is made up of indiviſible parts, or of parts diviſible? And whether that which is continued may be divided infinitely? There were anciently ſome that held, that a continued Body was compounded of indiviſible parts, as <hi>Pythagoras, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus, Leucippus,</hi> and the greateſt part of thoſe who flouriſhed in <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> time, and the Stoicks themſelves who in this point followed their Ringleader <hi>Zeno.</hi> But <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> undertakes their refutation, in the Sixt Book of his Phyſicks. Alſo they are oppoſed in that which is called, <hi>Of Indiviſible Lines,</hi> which goes up and down under <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Name, which ſome deny to be <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Book, though according to his judgment, and collected from his publick diſcourſes. And in this point the moſt excellent Phyloſophers and Mathematicians do follow <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> And though weighty Reaſons be alledged on both ſides yet ſhal I ſide with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and that for theſe Reaſons following.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, if that which is continued be compounded of indiviſibles, as for examples ſake, a Line of Points, one indiviſible with another, wil either make a thing continued, or a thing contiguous, or a thing whoſe parts are ranked one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another. But none of theſe can be. And therefore that which is continued is not compounded of indiviſibles. Indiviſibles are not continued. For continued things are thoſe whoſe outmoſt bounds are one and the ſame. But the outmoſt bound of Indivibles is not: for every extream is diſtinct from that thing whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream it is. And therefore indiviſibles are not continued. And for the ſame reaſon likewiſe they cannot be contiguous. For thoſe things are contiguous whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams are together. The ſame is alſo thus proved. What ever touches another thing, touches it either as an whol touches an whol, ſo that all its parts are toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the parts of the other, or as a part touches a whol, or as a part touches a part. After theſe latter manners, things indiviſible cannot touch one another: for that which is indiviſible hath not parts, nor can it be parted. Nor yet after the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer manner. For every thing continued, hath parts without parts, ſo that one part is, ſeated here, another there. If therefore in the making of a Line, the points ſhould totally touch one another, and in making a ſurface, the Lines ſhould total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touch one another; Finally in making a Body, the ſurfaces ſhould wholly touch one another: from all the points would ſpring one point, and from all the lines one line, and from all the ſurfaces one ſurface only. And ſo a thing indiviſible, added to what is indiviſible, makes it no greater then it was; nor does it conſtitute a thing continued, which conſiſts of many parts, each of which is without the reſt. Nor do indiviſible parts in a thing continued, follow one another as in rank or row: for ſo there ſhould come nothing of the ſame kind between: but between any indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibles, there comes ſomwhat elſe of the ſame kind: for betwixt two points there is a line, in which there muſt needs be points.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> If a Line were made of Points, or a Surface of Lines, or a Body of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces; a Line which did conſiſt of ten points, would be longer then that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts only of nine; and a Surface compounded of ten Lines ſhould be broader then that which does conſiſt of only nine; and a Body made up of ten Surfaces ſhould be deeper then that which is made only of nine. But theſe ſhould not ſo happen ſave for a point, a Line, a Surface. Therefore that point muſt have Longitude, that line Latitude, that Surface Craſſitude or Depth. For in reſpect of that which is not long, another thing cannot be ſaid to be longer; nor in reſpect of that which neither is broad nor hath breadth can another thing be ſaid to become broader; nor in reſpect of that which hath neither depth nor thickneſs, can a thing be ſaid to be
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:35070:22"/>thicker then another thing All which things notwithſtanding are manifeſtly falf. <hi>Thirdly</hi> it would follow, that there are very many magnitudes, which cannot be divided into two equal portions; which is falf: ſeeing, it is by the Mathematicians demonſtrated that every continued thing, may be divided into two equal halves, to which it hath a double proportion. For things conſiſting of unequal indiviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, cannot be divided into equal parts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It would then follow, that the Diameter of a Quadrate were equal to its ſide, and a greater circle equal to a leſs, which has the ſame centre: which is abſurd. For if you draw lines from every point of one ſide of the Quadrate, as many as you can poſſibly, to the oppoſite ſide, they will all paſs through every point of the Diameter, nor will there be any point therein, through which they wil not paſs. For thoſe lines fil all the ſpace of the Quadrate. So it from the Centre you draw lines to all the parts of the greater Circle, they will all likewiſe paſs through the leſſer Circle, and therefore the leſs wil have as many points as the greater, and ſo they will be equal. And from theſe inſtances it appears, that a continued thing does not conſiſt of indiviſibles, and therefore that it may be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into parts perpetually diviſible. For ſeeing it conſiſts of ſuch into ſuch it muſt needs be reſolved.</p>
                  <p>Yet we are here to obſerve, that a thing may be ſaid to be indiviſible two man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of waies: for a thing is either ſimply ſuch as having no parts: or reſpectively, which cannot be actually divided into ſuch parts, though it contain them, ſuch as are the ſmalleſt things Natural. And touching the former, is our Queſtion; <hi>viz.</hi> Whether a line, conſiſt of points; a Surface, of Lines; a Body, of Surfaces. Moreover we muſt know, that when it is ſaid a continued magnitude may be infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly divided we are not to underſtand, that it has infinite parts actually or potential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo as by continual dividing they may at length become infinite: but thus we muſt hold, that ſo many parts cannot be taken from a continued magnitude but more will remain. For we muſt not here admit of a real diviſion. For ſince all Quantity adheres in ſome Natural Body, and there are Natural Bodies of the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt ſize imaginable, there will be found a quantity actually the ſmalleſt poſſible. But we muſt thus underſtand it; that there cannot ſo ſmal a Quantity be aſſigned, but that our underſtanding can conceive it diviſible into two parts, and again each of theſe into two, and ſo continually deſcending lower and lower. Again, this is to be obſerved, that it is rightly ſaid, that a continued Quantity may be infinitly divided: but it cannot rightly be ſaid that it may be divided into infinite parts. For if we ſay into infinite parts, we ſay not true: for as the continued Quantity is actually finite: ſo alſo its parts are actually finite: and are terminated by the bounds of the whol. But this is true, that a continued magnitude is apt to be divided infinitely, that is to ſay, in dividing you cannot come to any thing but what may be divided again. And hence it does not follow, that what is continued in magnitude has infinite parts. For every whol is eſtimated by ſuch parts, as have a certain magnitude: and ſuch in every continued thing are finite: but thoſe parts in reſpect of which a continued Quantity is ſaid to be infinitely diviſible are not actually of any determinate magnitude.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto has been ſhewed that a continued Quantity in a Body Natural, is not compounded of indiviſible parts, and therefore is infinitly diviſible, although it be never actually divided into infinite parts; ſeeing Natural things have determinate bounds of their greatneſs or ſmalneſs. Touching which, ſeeing there is ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie amongſt Authors, I ſhal ad ſomwhat to what has been ſaid, and make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition into the greateſt and ſmalleſt Natural things. Wherein that I may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the better, I muſt premiſe ſome things.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Firſt place,</hi> Although the notions of <hi>Greateſt</hi> and Smalleſt, are transferred from Quantity to other things, as alſo Qualities and motions are; yet that in this place we ſpeak properly of Natural ſubſtances. For touching them the Queſtion is, whether they certain bounds and limits ſet to their Quantity. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this Queſtion may have a manifold ſenſe: as a man may ask both whether there be in Nature a greateſt and ſmalleſt ſubſtance, then which now can be greater or ſmaller: and whether Nature have ſet bounds of Quantity, ſo that ſhe hath not of her ſelf power, to make things bigger or leſſer? Moreover, it may be further que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton'd, Firſt whether there be abſolutely the greateſt and ſmalleſt thing poſſible,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:35070:22"/>in the Univerſe? Secondly, whether in every ſort of Natural Bodies both ſimple and compound, and of Homogeneal mixt Bodies as wel as Heterogeneal, and of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate as wel as inanimate, there are certain and ſet bounds of Greatneſs and ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Thirdly we are to obſerve that the terms or bounds of greatneſs and ſmalneſs are twofold; ſome intrinſecal which things receive from their own Nature: others extrinſecal, which are by others externally preſcribed to things. Fourthly, That the greateſt and leaſt are ſo termed Poſitively or Negatively. Poſitively that is the greateſt thing, which is greater then all others, and to which nothing is equal: and the leaſt contrarily Negatively, that is greateſt, then which nothing is greater, though there be ſomwhat equal. And that is Negatively the leaſt, than the which nothing is leſſer, though there may be ſomwhat as little.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things being premiſed, thus we conclude. I. In the whol Univerſe,
<note place="margin">There is Actually in the whole uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and in every ſort of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural things, ſomwhat greateſt &amp; ſomwhat leaſt.</note> and in every ſort of Natural things, there is actually ſomthing which is greateſt and ſomthing which is leaſt. For unleſs there were ſomwhat greateſt and ſomwhat leaſt, in the whol world, and in every ſort of things, either poſitively or Negative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: there might be a greater then any that is never ſo great, and a leſs then any that is never ſo ſmal, and ſo there ſhould be actually in Nature an infinite multitude of things. But that that cannot be, ſhall be hereafter demonſtrated. The ſame does alſo hereby appear; Seeing all accidents do follow the ſubſtantial Form: and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Natural Body, hath a Form actually determined: therefore every Natural Body muſt alſo have accidents determined and a limited Quantity. And, indeed, of all Bodies Heaven is the greateſt, becauſe it containes all things: but what the ſmaleſt thing is, we cannot peradventure determine. Howbeit <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. In every ſort of Live-things, there are intrinſecal bounds of greatneſs and ſmalneſs, without which Nature cannot produce nor conſerve Living things: ſo that no Individual or Particular Creature of that ſort, may be produced and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, which either exceeds that term of Magnitude, or fals ſhort thereof. For examples ſake, in caſe the greateſt Height of a Man be four Cubits, the ſmalleſt one Cubit: there can no man be generated that ſhall prove higher then four Cubits, or lower then one Cubit: but all ſhall be either of four, or of three, or of two, or of one Cubit, or of ſome other meaſure betwixt four and one.

And that Augmentation is definite, does hereby appear, becauſe it is an action of the Augmenting faculty, which is determinate as all other faculties of the Form are: the inſtruments alſo are definite or determined. For the very Natural Heat is limited, and becomes every day more remiſs. Yea, and is at laſt extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed. Yea, and al the other. Inſtruments are alſo limited. Nor is experience againſt it. For we never heard of a Dog born as big as an Elephant, nor grown to that greatneſs, nor of an Elephant born no greater then a Puppy-Dog. Howbeit, hard it is to ſet down and obſerve the terms, in every ſpecies. For they have ſundry variations, and more in one ſort, then in another. Amongſt Men there is a great diverſity of Magnitude; a greater amongſt Dogs; but not ſo great amongſt Cats, and Birds and other Animals.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. But the Elements have no determinate magnitude of themſelves and intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecally, but from without. For the Elements of themſelves, if they had matter enough; and there were no outward obſtacle might be augmented indefinitely.

<note place="margin">The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of Place.</note> wherein I imitate <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> I ſhal propound the chief proprieties of Place, and examine which do truly and properly belong thereto; that from thence it may appear, which of theſe opinions is moſt probable. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the 4. <hi>Book of his Phyſicks Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>Text</hi> 30. tels us, That theſe are the properties of Place. 1. To contain the thing placed, or whoſe place it is. 2. To be no part of the thing contained, which property ſome joyn with the foregoing, thus: a place does ſo contain the thing placed, as to be no part thereof. 3. That the place be neither greater nor leſſer, than the thing placed. 4. That the place is ſeparable from the thing placed; or as ſome read it, that the place cannot be without ſome body, but may be without this body or that. 5. That all place is upwards or downwards. 6. That every body is naturally car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to its own place, and is diſpoſed to reſt therein. Howbeit, ſome joyn this with the ſift. From other places, Authors gather more properties: for they ad, 7. That it is a property of Place to draw to it ſelf the thing placed: which they would draw out of the 4. <hi>of his Phyſicks, Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>Text</hi> 4. 8. That the place has a faculty of generating, conſerving, and perfecting the thing placed: which they draw from the 4. <hi>of his Phyſicks ch.</hi> 1. <hi>Text</hi> 4. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>Text</hi> 48. 49. from the 4. <hi>de Caelo Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>Text</hi> 23, 24. from his 8. <hi>de Hiſtoria Animalium Chap.</hi> 28, 29. 9. That the place gives diſtinction and unity to local motion. 10. That Place is immovable, 4. Phyſ. Chap. 4. Text 41. 11. Out of <hi>Pſellus</hi> they draw this property: that a Place is neither aboliſhed, nor does periſh, though the things which are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, may be aboliſhed.</p>
                  <p>And theſe are the chief Properties of Place which we meet with in Authors: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt which we muſt nevertheleſs diſtinguiſh. For, as to the firſt, ſecond, third, fourth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, they are ſimply neceſſary to a place, nor is there much doubt concerning them. As for the reſt, we muſt ſee in what ſence they may be admitted, and we muſt enquire, what agrees with a place in it ſelf and as it is a place, and what by accident: in which point there is no ſmal confuſionin Authors.

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi</hi> and <hi>Situs,</hi> which is not any place, but one affected with certain conditions, which they are nevertheleſs frequently accuſtomed to cal Place. Hence 'tis a common ſaying, that the place of light things is above, and of heavy things beneath: becauſe in the middle of the world there are qualities by which hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy things are amicably cheriſhed; and about Heaven there are qualities that cheriſh light things: which Qualities nevertheleſs do not neceſſarily belong unto the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of place. For even the fire in the Bowels of the Earth is in a Place, though not favorable thereunto. Hence alſo <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his 8. <hi>B. de Hiſtoria Animalium, Chap.</hi> 19.28, 29. <hi>Probleme</hi> 15. <hi>Section</hi> 14 and <hi>Pliny</hi> every where, ſaies that the natures of platns and Animals are divers according to the variety of places wherein they are
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:35070:24"/>and that ſome places are convenient and others inconvenient.</p>
                  <p>Since therefore theſe are reckoned amongſt the proprieties of place: that every thing is carried to its place; that the place does allure and draw to it ſelf the thing placed; that the place has a power to generate, conſerve and perfect the thing pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced therein: we muſt know, that all theſe properties do not agree to a place, as it is a place. For ſeeing a place as <hi>Toletus</hi> ſaies, is formally Quantity: it is not of the Eſſence thereof to be a Cauſe. For Magnitude as they ſay, is not the efficient of an accident; which <hi>Scaliger</hi> alſo intimates in his 5. <hi>Exercitation, It is not true</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>that bodies are preſerved by their place, but by their form.</hi> And if a Place as a Place, and therefore not a proper one, ſhould conſerve: the Elements would not ſeek to get out of that place into their proper place. The Elements therefore are not preſerved by their place; but by their <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi. Scaliger</hi> in the <hi>ſame Exercitation, Section</hi> 5. But ſo far the Place is ſaid to preſerve the thing placed, inaſmuch as the body there placed, does conveniently receive the Qualities of the Heavens and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements which are moſt agreeable thereunto: and inaſmuch as Qualities friendly to the thing placed, are in the Subject which is about the place.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, ſeeing in the ſearching out of the nature of things, that which is by it ſelf, muſt be carefully diſtinguiſhed from that which is by accident: we do here underſtand the term Place, not in the latter, but in the former Senſe: Nor do we allow of that ſaying, that only the Elements are in a Place. For we do not here ſeek after the Adjunct of ſome ſort of natural Bodies; but our Enquiry is, what <hi>Place</hi> is in it ſelf couſidered, and as it agrees to al natural bodies in general, and to al their ſorts as a proper adjunct.</p>
                  <p>We are now in the next place to conſider,
<note place="margin">Whether the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of place do beſt agree to a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face or a ſpace?</note> whether the genuine Properties of place do beſt agree to the Surface of a body containing, or to the Space commenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with the thing placed. And that we may begin with immobility; <hi>that</hi> is a moſt true propriety of Place, and by <hi>Pererius</hi> his confeſſion, though it make againſt himſelf, it is an eſſential Propriety thereof, even as riſibility or a diſpoſition to Laughter is an eſſential propriety of Mankind; and as <hi>Aegidius Romanus</hi> ſaies <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Phyſ.</hi> 1.41. <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. the very formal being of a place. To the aſſerting whereof, though there were no other Reaſon, this might ſuffice, that all Men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever their opinion is concerning Place, do herein agree, that a Place muſt be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediable, and every one endeavors to accommodate this propriety to his Place. And verily he that takes away the immobility of Place, he takes away local moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the diſtinction thereof. For that which is moved, of neceſſity leaves one place and goes into another: which could not be, if the place were moved with the thing.</p>
                  <p>From this Propriety therefore we conclude: ſeeing place is neceſſarily immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, and the ſurface of a body containing is not immovable: that it is no Place. For ſuppoſe a Tower or a Pillar erected, or a Tree growing up in the Air, or ſuppoſe an Hill in a River, or in the Air, at every moment as the Wind blows and the River runs, their place wil be changed, which is againſt the Nature of Place. Yea and this great Abſurdity wil hence follow: that one and the ſame body, fixed in one and the ſame ſpace, quiet and without motion, ſhall have every moment a new place, and ſo be in an innumerabe company of places.</p>
                  <p>In this Argument the maintainers of a Surface to be Place, are variouſly perple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed as we may ſee in <hi>Pererius</hi> Book 11. Phyſ. Chap. 2, 3. and <hi>Tolet.</hi> Book 4. Phyſ. Queſt. 5. And <hi>Pererius</hi> himſelf demonſtrates that the anſwers carefully ſought out by <hi>Scotus</hi> and <hi>Aquinas</hi> are not ſatisfactory. And it wil be worth our while to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whether he brings any thing more to the purpoſe, ſeeing many affirm that he has anſwered all Objections. Now this is the judgment of <hi>Pererius:</hi> Firſt, he ſaies the word Place is uſed in common and vulgar acceptation for ſcituation and poſition; and 'tis commonly ſaid a thing has this or that place, meaning that it is ſo or ſo ſcituated; and therefore a thing may change its place two waies, either actively or paſſively: Actively, when it paſſes out of one place into another, leaving the place wherein it was before: Paſſively, when the thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains immovable, but the place about it is changed. He ſuppoſes therefore, that a Tower, a Pillar, or Mountain, about which ever and anon the ſurface of the Air or Water is changed, are not properly in the ſame place: yet they remain in the ſame place, by place intending ſcituation: or they remain in the ſame place actively;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:35070:25"/>becauſe theſe bodies themſelves do not paſs from place to place: yet they remain not in the ſame place paſſively; becauſe the Surface of the Air and water compaſſing the ſaid bodies, does not remain the ſame in number, but is ever and anon changed. This is <hi>Pererius</hi> his defence, which whether it be not contrary to al Reaſon and ſenſe, let himſelf judg. But I would firſt have <hi>Pererius</hi> reconcile this propoſition which is in his 11. B. ch. 3. p. 615. The Surface of the Body containing, which is of the Eſſence of place, is not alwaies the ſame in number about the ſame thing placed but is ever and anon varied; with that, in his 1. ch. p 607. immobility is eſſential to place, becauſe it is an eſſential property thereof, as riſibility is of a Man, and becauſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mobility is uſed in the definition of Place, inſtead of an eſſential difference. Can Surface be of the eſſence of place, and yet not be immoveable which is an eſſential propriety of place? Again I grant, that the term place is frequently uſed for the Scituation and Poſition of a Natural Body, and allow ſuch a ſpeech be proper enough: Yea, and if ſo be a thing remains in the ſame Scituation, I aver againſt <hi>Pererius,</hi> that it remaines in the ſame place; for Scituation alwaies preſuppoſes place, and it ſignifies the relation of the thing placed to the place. And therefore Natural bodies when they change their place, do alſo change their Scituation. And it is, doubtles, a great Abſurdity to ſay, that a thing not moved with any local mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould change its place. For a new place is gained only by local motion: and that which changes place, is locally moved, and by local motion, we are bronght to the knowledg of place, as may be ſeen in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> 4. <hi>Phyſic. Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>Text</hi> 32. And therefore <hi>Tolet</hi> rightly ſaies: If I ſtir not, and the Surface about me be changed, it may not be granted that I am not ſtil in the ſame place. That is therefore a weak defence, which is made by diſtinguiſhing betwixt active mutation of place and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive. For ſeeing to change place actively, is for a body to be transferred out of one place into another; to change place paſſively muſt be, for the Place to come unto and be moved to the thing placed: then which, what is more abſurd? Nor is <hi>Ant. Ruvius</hi> more happy in his ſolution, Book, 4. <hi>Phyſ. Queſt.</hi> 3. who confeſſing, that this Argument is ſo difficult, that in regard of the difficulty thereof, Authors have been divided, as to the manner of attributing Immobility to place; and examining and rejecting the opinions of others, he is at laſt forced to confeſs ingenuouſly; that it is impoſſible that the whol Nature of Place, ſhould conſiſt in a Stirface, and that <hi>Place</hi> ſhould be immoveable; ſince 'tis evident, that the ambient Surface is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly varied, and that therefore place requires ſomwhat, in reſpect of which it may be immoveable. And at length he is fain to fly to this, that Particular places, are therefore immoveable, becauſe they are parts o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>otal place, or parts of that whol ſpace, real or imaginary, which is comprehended under the compaſs of the Skies. Whereby to ſay the truth, he ſo leaves <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> as to joyn with them that ſay place is that ſpace, which every Body fils.</p>
                  <p>Another propriety of place, is to be equal to the thing placed. But the Surface is not equal the to thing placed; and therefore it is not the place. For a Surface hath only two dimenſions, but a Body three. Nor does <hi>Pererius</hi> his anſwer remove the difficulty: <hi>viz.</hi> That the place is equal to the thing placed, becauſe the convex Surface of the thing placed, and the hollow Surface of the thing containing are equal. For the Queſtion is not about the Quality of the Surfaces of a thing contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and a thing contained: but touching place and the thing placed. Now Bodies are placed, and not Surfaces. And therefore it is neceſſary, that a place, be not only equal to the Surface of the thing placed, but to al the dimenſions thereof: for otherwiſe the place ſhould not be equal to the thing placed. For a Line is not ſaid to be equal to a Surface, nor a ſurface to a Body; but a Line to a Line, a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to a Surface, and a Body to a Body.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not compare any more proprieties of a place with a Surface. For what hath been already ſaid,
<note place="margin">A ſurface does not agree to al Bodies.</note> is more then thoſe can anſwer, who wil have place to be a Surface. Yet one thing I wil add. <hi>Place</hi> is a common Adjunct of al Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Bodies, and ought to agree to all. But the Surface of a Body containing, does not agree to all Bodies. Therefore it is no place. For the Higheſt Heaven, hath no Surface of any Body to compaſs the ſame about:
<note place="margin">The high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Heaven is in a place.</note> whereas it is nevertheleſs a Body, and is locally moved; and therefore requires a place. For whereas ſome think it is no abſurdity to ſay, that the higheſt Heaven is in no place, nor that every Natural Body hath a place: this ſeems unreaſonable. For that every Body
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:35070:25"/>is in a place, and that a Body cannot be without a place nor a place without a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, is the Aſſertion of the graveſt Phyloſophers <hi>Avenroes, Johannes Grammaticus, Porphyrius, Marſilius Ficinus,</hi> and very many more both antient and late Authors. Nor does <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſeem to diſſent in this point, in the 4. <hi>Phyſ. C.</hi> 1 <hi>Text</hi> 6. <hi>and</hi> 1. <hi>de Caelo, Ch.</hi> 7. <hi>T.</hi> 69. And that aſſertion is not void of reaſon in the 4. <hi>Phyſ. C.</hi> 7. <hi>T.</hi> 1. <hi>Everything that is, is ſomwhere, and that which is not, is no where, and that which is no where, is not.</hi> Natural Bodies, are real beings, and therefore they are ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. Now there are three manner of waies, whereby a thing may be ſomwhere, Repletively, Definitively, Circumſcriptively, or Locally. But Natural Bodies cannot Naturally be ſaid to be any where in the two firſt manners.
<note place="margin">God is preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletively.</note> For it belongs only to God to be Repletively any where: who as <hi>Damaſcrin</hi> truly writes in Book 1 Ch. 16. <hi>is totally every where, totally in all things, and totally above all things.</hi> Or as <hi>Scaliger</hi> in his 1. <hi>de Plantis; who is by all things, above all things, in all things, before all things, after all things, High, Glorious, Immenſe, Incomparable, Incomprehenſible.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Angels definitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bodies Natural Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptively or locally.</note> And to be any where definitively, is ſaid of Angels. And therefore Naturally bodies as ſuch, where ever they are ſaid to be, they are ſaid to be there Locally: and by Reaſon of their Circumſcript and Determinate dimenſions, they are in a Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed and Determinate ſpace. Hence <hi>Du-Rand</hi> ſaies wel in 4 <hi>Sect. Diſtinct.</hi> 44. <hi>Queſt.</hi> 6. <hi>In this reſpect only a place is poſſeſt by the thing placed; becauſe the thing pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced hath within the place, the diſtention of its parts. Since therefore this is eſſential to the thing placed, at it has Quantity, it is impoſſible the thing placed ſhould be in the place, and not take the ſame up.</hi> And a little after: <hi>If a Body be locally in a place, it cannot be, but it muſt take the place up: becauſe to take a place up, is to have in the place parts diſtant in poſition one from another and from all other Quantity: and that is nothing elſe, but to have Quantity.</hi> Alſo there is a moſt elegant place to be ſeen in <hi>Scaligers</hi> 56. <hi>Exercitation, Sect.</hi> 6. wherein he ſhews, how the place is neceſſary to the thing placed. And in very deed, motion does ſufficiently teach, that the Heaven is in a place. For ſeeing every thing that is moved, is moved in its place, by local moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and the Heaven is moved with local motion; we muſt by no means deny that it is in a place. Nor can local motion be imagined without a place, Yea verily, though the Heaven were without motion; yet the Heaven of its own Nature is in a place. For ſeeing place belongs to bodies not only becauſe of their motion, but that Natural Bodies are in place when they ſtir not; what ever you will aſſigne to be the cauſe why Natural Bodies are in place, it wil be found alſo in the Heaven: ſeeing it is a Natural Body.</p>
                  <p>And whereas the Authority of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is objected, who in the 5. of his Phyſicks Chap. 5, Text 43. delivers this rule of knowing what Bodies are in a place and what not; <hi>viz.</hi> That Body is in a place, without which there is another Body that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines it: but that is not, without which there is none: this Authority does not hinder us at al. For <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> did build this rule upon his preſuppoſed definition of place; which definition falling, this rule fals: and withal the argument drawn therefrom. <hi>viz.</hi> That the Heaven is not in a place; becauſe place is the Surface of a Body containing: but without the Heavens there is no Body. For here the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is beg'd: and it is more doubted whether place be a Surface, then whether the Heaven be in a place.</p>
                  <p>Seeing therefore, for theſe and many other Reaſons,
<note place="margin">Place is a ſpace not a ſurface.</note> that Opinion which makes place to be the Surface of a Body containing, cannot poſſibly ſtand: and by confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all Peripateticks, ſuch a thing as place there is, and it is diſtinct from the thing placed; I do aver, that a place is all that place long, broad, and deep, which the Body placed does Occupy and this ſpace is a thing different from the Bodies themſelves. For though you ſhould imagine al the Bodies in the univerſe to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, there would remaine a ſpace, long, broad, and deep; which nevertheleſs, is not at any time actually without Bodies: but the whol Univerſe fils this whol ſpace, and every part of the Univerſe challenges a part of the whol ſpace, equal to it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Now that there is ſuch a ſpace is apparent out of the 4. of Phyſicks,
<note place="margin">Whether there is ſuch a ſpace.</note> Text 3. and the change of things out of one place into another ſhews as much. For there where Water now is, <hi>viz.</hi> In the Veſſel, when that is powred out there will be Air, or ſome other Body of equal dimenſions wil poſſeſs the ſame place. Nor does this happen only in reſpect of Surface. For unleſs a Veſſel be emptied according to al
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:35070:26"/>dimenſions; another body cannot go into it; and the thing placed fils its place ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the three dimenſions. Let there be two Veſſels of equal Magnitude and Capacity, in reſpect of their concave ſurface; and fil the one which ſhal have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it but Air, which Water: and afterward pour the ſame water into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the middeſt whereof a ſtone ſhal hang by a thred; the water will not all be contained, by a veſſel of the ſame capacity and ſurface. What is the cauſe hereof? If a ſurface be place, what is the reaſon, that, ſeeing there are in theſe two Veſſels equal ſurfaces, and conſequently equal places, they do not receive a Body placed of the ſame ſize? Namely, becauſe a place is to be defined and eſtimated not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſurface, but the whol ſpace and profundity, according to which the thing is placed. And that two bodies cannot be together, is not therefore, becauſe of the ſurface of the Body containing, but becauſe each body requires a peculiar ſpace for it ſelf to exiſt in.</p>
                  <p>And that this ſpace is place,
<note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties of place agree with ſpace</note> does hereby alſo appear, in that all the genuine proprieties of place do agree thereunto; and by this opinion, thoſe great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are avoided, which vex other opinions. For the ſpace containes the thing pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced therein, and is equal thereunto: and is never without one body or other; but it may be without this Body or that: it is immoveable, nor when any Body is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, does the ſpace wherein it was move with it: but the Body paſſes out of one part of this ſpace into another. Alſo by this opinion, that moſt difficult Queſtion, in the anſwering whereof, one ſide is much puzzled as may be ſeen in <hi>Pererius B.</hi> 11. <hi>Ch.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is in its ſpace.</note> 8. <hi>Tolet B.</hi> 4. <hi>Phyſ. Queſt.</hi> 7. <hi>Colleg. Conimbr. Book,</hi> 4. <hi>Phyſ. Ch.</hi> 5. <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. <hi>Art.</hi> 12. <hi>viz.</hi> How the uppermoſt Heaven is in place, may eaſily be anſwered. For it is in its ſpace which it occupies, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> rightly ſaies in his 5. <hi>Exercitation, Sect.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>Now what for a thing this ſpace is,
<note place="margin">What this ſpace is?</note> is not very eaſie to determine. Yet we muſt not therefore deny that there is ſuch a thing. For theſe are diſtinct Queſtions, whether a thing be and what it is, And if we ſhould deny there were any thing but that the Nature whereof is perfectly known to us: we muſt deny againſt manifeſt reaſon the beings of many things, becauſe their Eſſence is hid from us. Howbeit, when they who deny the uppermoſt Heaven to be in a place, ſhal explain what that ſame <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi</hi> is, in which the upmoſt Heaven exiſts and is moved: it will be eaſie to explain what this ſpace is. Or let them tel us, what is the Eſſence of the firſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and we ſhall with the ſame eaſe unfold the Nature of ſpace. For if from a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Body I remove in my thoughts all the form, and all the adjuncts proceeding therefrom, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf in the 7. of his <hi>Metaphyſicks, Ch.</hi> 3. <hi>Text</hi> 7. Deſcribes it by the negation of all things: what I pray you will there remain? And ſhall we therefore, becauſe we cannot ſufficiently underſtand the Eſſence thereof, and can only comprehend it by a baſtard kind of reaſoning, cal it only an imaginary kind of thing? By no means. Even ſo, though our mind cannot conceive ſpace, ſave by the denial of al Bodies: it does not therefore follow that it is nothing, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing different from the Body. For if this and this and that and that Body, may be removed from this ſpace; doubt leſs all theſe Bodies, wil be different from this ſpace, and the Space from the Bodies.</p>
                  <p>Yet I ſhal produce what Authors think therof. <hi>Proclus</hi> held this ſpace to be a body animate, indiviſible, immovable, immaterial. Others wil have this ſpace to be nothing real, but of it ſelf an emptyneſs, or privation of a Body, which yet it can receive. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſay, this ſpace is an accident, <hi>viz.</hi> A Quantity, long broad and deep: not as <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus,</hi> exiſting by it ſelf without any Body, but alwaies conjoyned with ſome Body. <hi>Jordanus Brunus Nolanus,</hi> takes it to be a fift kind of Cauſe. Which ſeems to have been an old opinion. For they relate from <hi>Albertus Magnus,</hi> that the Peripateticks did reckon place amongſt the Principles of Nature: from whoſe opinion, <hi>Franciſcus Patricius,</hi> ſeems not to differ, in his <hi>Book de Spatio Phyſico.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Among theſe opinions, becauſe the three laſt have renowned Men for their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, I am minded to propound them according to their Authors intents. Not but that I know the Objections which thoſe opinions alſo are liable unto; ſeeing it is much eaſier to overthrow <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> opinion of place, then to tel what ſpace is: but to the intent that the diligent ſearchers of Nature, may have hereby an occaſion to think of the matter. For as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> wiſely writes in the 2. <hi>of his Metaphyſicks Ch.</hi> 1. <hi>For we are not only bound to thank them that have ſo writ as to ſatisfie us with their opinions, but them alſo who have ſpoken but ſuperficially, for even theſe men alſo advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:35070:26"/>us by affording matter to exerciſe our wits.</hi> And as <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaies well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in <hi>his firſt Book of Plants, A ſtudious Perſon ſhould paſs nothing over, which may offer it ſelf as an occaſion of fuller contemplation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Julius Caeſar Scaliger</hi> therefore, in his 5. <hi>Exercitation. Sect.</hi> 9. ſaies, that this Space is a Vacuity ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>led with Bodies, or a <hi>Vacuum</hi> wherein is a Body, whoſe Nature is ſuch, that when one Body gives place to another, there is a <hi>Vacuum</hi> or Empty ſpace made, that the other Body may come in as Privation is a Vacuity of the Form to be introduced: and nevertheleſs is by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> placed amongſt the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Nature. For as <hi>Epicurus,</hi> in his <hi>Epiſtle to</hi> Herodotus <hi>in</hi> Diogenes Laertius, <hi>writer;</hi> If <hi>that were not, which we call emptyneſs or ſpace, Natural Bodies would no have where to be, nor would any thing be moved, as now we ſee things are moved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the laſt opinion ſave one <hi>Phyloponus</hi> did long ago ſtifly maintain, and ſome even in this Age do account it no abſurdity. Nor do they conceive, that which is objected againſt this opinion, much to hinder the ſame: <hi>viz.</hi> if ſpace it ſelf be long, broad and deep, and another body ſhould be placed therein, there would be penetration of dimenſions. For two Bodies are not hindred to be in one place, in reſpect of Quantity alone; for ſo a Body of the Predicament of ſubſtance could not be with a Body of the Predicament of Quantity; whereas nevertheleſs theſe two are one and the ſame in number and ſubject; but becauſe of the corporeal matter. And we muſt difference a Body extended and meaſured out, from the extenſion and meaſurement it ſelf: whereof the former is a corporeal ſubſtance, the latter an accident: both which are nevertheleſs termed a body, by reaſon of that penury of words in this Caſe. Hence <hi>Johannes Grammaticus</hi> himſelf ſaies,
<note place="margin">What a Body is?</note> that <hi>a Body is not a threefold dimenſion, but that ſubſtance to which the ſaid dimenſion is inherent as in a ſubject.</hi> Nor does any remarkable abſurdity follow from this opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> that an accident ſhould paſs out of one ſubject into another. For that paſſage only of a Form or adjunct out of one ſubject into another is impoſſible, whereby an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident or Form being one in number, does leave its whole ſubject, and paſs into another: but if a ſubſtantial or accidental Form, does not go out of its whol ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but remain therein, it is not abſurd that it ſhould go out of one part into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Therefore every dimenſion may receive any Body, as one part of the dimenſion of the whol Univerſe, may contain alſo ſome part of the Univerſe in it.</p>
                  <p>Finally, Neither does that follow from this opinion, that there can be places actually infinite, or that a place can have a place, or that a place, can change its place, as it is in the 4. <hi>of Phyſicks Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>Text</hi> 37. For the parts of water are in water, as in their whol, and in ſpace as in their place: which if they are finite, they have finite Spaces anſwerable, if infinite, they have infinite. Moreover ſince all the water changes place, the parts alſo of the water change place: yet place does not change place, nor is there a place of place. But as the whol and parts are transferred: ſo alſo the whol and parts change place: but the ſpace which is part of the Univerſal ſpace, remaines immovable. For neither a River, or Heaven or a Veſſel, or any ſuch thing is a place, but that ſpace wherein a River, Heaven or a Veſſel or any other thing is contained.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Didacus Maſius</hi> out of <hi>Philoponus</hi> and other Defenders of Space, does thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the nature thereof. The nature thereof is a body: for it conſiſts of three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions, Longitude, Latitude, and Profundity: yet is it immaterial; becauſe it has no matter nor form. For it ought to penetrate the thing placed, according to all its dimenſions: but if it were material it could not penetrate. And therefore it is alſo indiviſible; becauſe from it no parts can be taken away. For diviſion can only have place in ſuch things as conſiſt of matter: and moreover it is ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed from the Bodies placed therein. For the ſame ſpace in number which contains t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>. Wine in the Flagon, the ſame receives Air, and when that is gone Water or ſome other Liquor. And therefore it receives not its individual nature from the Bodies, but of the bodies within whoſe ſides it is contained, as the ſpace in the Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon from the Flagon; that in the Air from the Air. Moreover it is affected with no qualities; becauſe it is neither white, nor black, nor hot, nor cold. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſeems rather a Mathematical Body, ſeparate from all ſenſible matter, then a Phyſical and natural body. Alſo it penetrates al bodies which it imbraces in its Lap, yet without diviſion, as ſweetneſs penetrates through the whol Body of the Milk
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:35070:27"/>without dividing the ſame. For ſo it penetrates all bodies which it contains, as to fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> them according to all their parts and dimenſions, but not ſo as to divide them. Finally, there is one ſpace in the whol univerſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and world, equal thereunto, which in divers parts receives divers Bodies. Nor when a Body is moved from place to place, does it carry its Space with it, but it paſſes out of one part of the Space into another, the ſpace it ſelf remaining wholly immovable.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Franciſcus Petricius</hi> does thus conceive of Place. Firſt, He ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now he ſaies this Space was before all other things produced by God the great Work-maſter, inaſmuch as all other things ſtood in need thereof, and without it they could not be. And whereas it is hard to know what Space is; he ſaies it is no wonder: for all the Qualities of Bodies whereby they incur into our ſenſes, are la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the Bodies themſelves: but Space is different from Bodies, yea and is before Bodies. For he makes Space the firſt of all worldly things, yea before the world it ſelf. For if the world (ſaies he) ſhould be deſtroied, and reduced to nothing that ſpace in which the world is now, as in its place would remain quite empty. But it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>unto. For it happens by reaſon of the Bodies, which are al differrent therefrom. And he ſaies that Space is no otherwiſe a place, than as it affords a place for bodies to abide in, and of its own nature, before it is a place, it is a part of the univerſal ſpace. And to that com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>on objection, If Space be any thing, it is either a Subſtance or Accident, he anſwers: Space of it ſelf, ſince it goes before the world, and is without the world, is no worldly thing, excepting that part thereof which contains the world, or which the world poſſeſſes with its Body but goes before al worldly things, whether bodily or not bodily, Subſtantial or not Subſtantial, and as all things are accidents to it, ſo is it to all things: and that this ſame ſpace was unknown to the Authors of the Predicaments. And at laſt he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines Space to be an hypoſtatical extenſion, ſubſiſting of it ſelf, inherent in nothing, But if it muſt needs be of ſome predicament: if (ſaies he) that be a ſubſtance, which ſuſtains other things, which ſubſiſts of it ſelf, which is not inherent in any other thing, then Space is perfectly a Subſtance. For Space ſubſiſts of it ſelf, it reſts upon nothing, it needs nothing, to help it to be, or to ſuſtain it but it ſelf ſuſtains ſubſtances, and ſo enables them to be, and it ſupports all other things in nature. Alſo that it is the Original of Quantity, and that it has length, breadth, depth, and all dimenſions: alſo that it is never moved in whol or in part, but whatſoever things are moved, are moved through this ſpace, ſo that it ſelf is wholly unmoved and unmovable, What he ſurther writes at large ſee in his Book <hi>de ſpacto Phyſico.</hi> This one thing only I ad. The Quantity of a Body, is moved with the body it ſelf whoſe Quantity it is: but as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf ſaies, a body tranſlated into the place of another, poſſeſſes the ſame place in number and nature, which that body into whoſe place it comes did before poſſeſs. For example ſake, Water ſucceeds Air in the ſame numerical place; and ſo the Quantity of the Air and Water, are nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically different from the Quantity of the Space; ſince each remains in its own body, though it takes up and poſſeſſes another place. And ſeeing the Place is no part of the thing placed, nor any part (as has been ſhewed) of the ambient body, what other thing I pray you can we immagine, when both the Ambient Body, and the thing placed be removed but a Space having three dimenſions of Length, Breadth, Depth? And ſo much for this point. Let us conclude this hard diſcourſe with an excellent ſaying of <hi>Julius Caeſar Scaliger</hi> in the 297.

                  <p>A Peculiar adjunct of Eſſence, is that which Phyloſophers cal Duration; that is, as they ſay, a continual tract of being, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> rightly has it,
<note place="margin">How Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from Eſſence &amp; Exiſtency?</note> in his 350. <hi>Exerci ation Sect.</hi> 7. For Duration is the meaſure of the being of every thing; and in every thing, theſe three follow one another. Eſſence Exiſtence, and Duration: which hold this order, that Eſſence is firſt, Exiſtence next, and Duration laſt of al: Now Duration differs, as wel from the Eſſence as the Exiſtence of a thing. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed from the Eſſence of a thing it differs really. For there are divers things which have the ſame Eſſence, and yet have different durations. But from the exiſtence of a thing, Duration differs not really. For it is in a manner nothing elſe for a thing to dure, than to exiſt; and it is al one for a thing to be of a ſhort or long exiſtency, and for a thing to have a ſhort or a long duration. And as the extenſion of Quantity is to Quantity (which nevertheleſs do not r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ally differ) ſo is the Duration of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtency to Exiſtency it ſelf, yet there is ſome difference between them. For the Nature of exiſtency, is only this, that a thing be out of its Cauſes, and actually ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what; But Duration ſignifies the extention of a thing, in this its being, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation or abidance of the exiſtency. Duration therefore properly belongs to exiſtency, not to Quiddity, and it alwaies preſuppoſes exiſtency, without which it can neither be, nor be underſtood.
<note place="margin">Duration defined.</note> Hence therefore Duration is not amiſs defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that it is the Extenſion of the Exiſtence of a thing: or the abidance of a thing in its Eſſence.</p>
                  <p>Now ſuch as the Eſſence of things is, ſuch is alſo its Meaſure: and as many manners as there are of a things abiding in its Eſſence, ſo many durations it has.
<note place="margin">A three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> As things therefore are threefold, ſo is there a threefold duration, or as ſome phraſe it, a threefold meaſure of Duration; Time, Age, Eternity. For the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the duration of things, which are no waies infinite, and which have both a Beginning and End, is Time: The meaſure of the duration of things, which are partly finite, <hi>viz.</hi> in reſpect of their beginning, and partly infinite becauſe they have no end, is called <hi>Aevum,</hi> Age or Aeveternity. But Eternity is the meaſure of the dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of that which is abſolutely infinite, having neither Beginning nor End. But we are now to treat of Time.</p>
                  <p>Al Men do frequently talk of Time, and are often mentioning To day, Yeſterday to Morrow, and tell of daies, months and years; and in ſo doing they acknowledg that time is really ſomewhat: but what that is, very few can tel: and there have alwaies been ſundry opinions about the nature of time, as may be ſeen in <hi>Franciſc. Piccollimineus</hi> his <hi>Book de Nat. com. Affect. ch.</hi> 13. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> reckons up three and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes them in 4. <hi>Phyſ. ch.</hi> 10. For ſome would have time to be the motion of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens; others the greateſt of the celeſtial Spheres, others Motion ſimply conſidered. That we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ay therefore find out what Time is, we muſt know, that time may be two waies conſidered; Firſt as the internal duration of a thing which has had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and ſhal have end, and is ſucceſſively continued, and to ſay all in a word, of a thing which is movable; Secondly for the meaſure of the ſaid duration by ſome mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ion: and in this latter ſenſe time is commonly underſtood by natural Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, who hold that time is not without motion, nor can be underſtood without motion. For then we underſtand Time, when we underſtand there has been mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>and when we perceive no motion, we are ignorant that any time has paſſed:</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in ſuch as ſleep: For they when they are awaked, joyning the moment wherein they fel aſleep with the moment of their waking, conceive no time to have paſſed between; which that Tale ſhews cited by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in Lib. 4. Phyſ. ch. 11. t. 97. Alike Story to which others relate, of three men at <hi>Athens</hi> who being drunk at a Feſtival, ſlept three daies together. For when one of them did awake the next night after that in which he firſt lay down, and ſaw the Stars ſtil ſhining, ſuppoſing that firſt night was not yet over, nor the Sun yet riſen, he compoſed himſelf again to ſleep, til at laſt a waking with his companions on the third day, he returned to the Feaſt, believing it was the next day following that night wherein he went drunk to bed. And a Story or Fable not unlike is related by <hi>Pliny</hi> in his 1 Book
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:35070:28"/>of his <hi>Natural Hiſtory ch.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Time is ſomwhat of Motion</note> 52. <hi>of Epimenides.</hi> And dayly experience ſuggeſts the the like. Time therefore is not without motion, yea and ſomwhat thereof is moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Motion are perceived together.</hi> For though we ſit ſtil in the dark, and perceive no motion by any of our Senſes: if we conceive any in our minds, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently time preſents it ſelf therewith; and again, as often as we think of time, ſome motion does alſo therewith offer it ſelf to our minds. Time therefore is ſomthing of Motion: which what it is, let us thus further ſearch out.</p>
                  <p>Whatſoevever is moved, is moved from ſomwhat to ſomwhat, that is to ſay, from the term from which, to the term to which; ſo that between thoſe two terms there lies a Magnitude. Now all Magnitude is continued. And therefore that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is made continually, through a continued magnitude, muſt it ſelf be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued: and conſequently Time alſo muſt be continued: for ſo great as is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo great is the Time: and a longer motion is performed in a longer time, a ſhorter in a ſhorter. Moreover in magnitude, there is former and latter. For eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry magnitude is diviſible into parts, which are ſo diſpoſed, that ſome go before, others come after. For which cauſe, there is proportionably ſomwhat which comes before, and ſomwhat which goes after in motion: and thoſe parts of a moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are firſt, by which the Movable is moved over the firſt parts of magnitude, and thoſe latter, by which it is moved over the laſt. And for the ſame cauſe, alſo in time there muſt be a former and a latter; and ſo motion inaſmuch as it has former and latter, agrees with time, ſo that by the diſtinction of former and latter in motion, we come to the knowledg of time. For when we conſider two Inſtances or two extreams, wherewith motion is terminated, and underſtand that there is a middle ſpace betwixt theſe two extreams, preſently we conceive time. Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife, when we conceive any thing under the notion of one Inſtant, and do not think of two Inſtances one former, the other latter: we perceive no time at all.</p>
                  <p>From what has been ſaid we therefore gather,
<note place="margin">The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of Time. A twofold number.</note> that <hi>Time is the number of Motion in reſpect of former and latter.</hi> Which Definition that it may be more rightly underſtood and explained, theſe things are to be obſerved. In the firſt place, that Number is two-fold, the one <hi>Nmubring</hi> as two three &amp;c. the other <hi>Numbred</hi> as two Stones, three Trees, four Men. The former, which is alſo called formal number, and wherewith we reckon, is one <hi>Ens</hi> or being of it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> diſcreet Quantity, by cogitation abſtracted from all matter, and perceptible by the mind: and it is common to all things, nor is multiplied according to the variety of things numbred. Or the word Number is taken two waies; Firſt for Quantity diſcreet, or a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude conſiſting of parts diſtinct one from another, or for any meaſure though conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued. Now time is not a number in the firſt, but in the laſt ſenſe; nor is time a number wherewith we count (ſeeing time is a continued Quantity, number a Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity diſcreet) but a number counted or reckoned, <hi>viz.</hi> the parts of motion recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned up, For we muſt not here paſs over, that ſome diſtinguiſh betwixt a number nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable and numbred, and ſay that a number numerable are things, which have an aptitude to be numbred and diſtinguiſhed by the underſtanding, although act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually they are not numbred: but a number numbred are things, which are already actually numbred by ſomebody. And they ſay that time is a number nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, or a motion, which may be diſtinguiſhed, ſo as to have ſome parts going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, others coming after, although there were no man actually to number the ſame. From whence it appears, <hi>that Time is a real thing.</hi> For the aptitude to be numbred, or the numerability, does not depend upon the numberer, but is in the time and motion it ſelf. A number numerable is again twofold: the one which Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres to things which are really ſeparate one from another: and ſuch a number time is not: the other, conſiſts of parts diſtinguiſhed one from another, not really, but by our thoughts, as if a man ſhould conceive ſome continued magnitude divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to certain parts; and ſuch a number is time. For it is a flux and continual ſpin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out, of the parts of motion, which perpetually follow one another.</p>
                  <p>Moreover <hi>this</hi> alſo is to be obſerved in this place;
<note place="margin">A <hi>Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</hi>
                     </note> that a Meaſure is twofold: one <hi>formal</hi> which is called <hi>menſurata</hi> meaſured, or <hi>menſurabilis</hi> menſurable; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Meaſuring</hi> which is called active: which others expreſs by ſaying that time is the number of motion actively or paſſively. Formal Meaſure, is that which when it
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:35070:28"/>is in any ſubject, it makes it formally meaſurable; and thus every quantity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in any Subject, makes the ſame to be formally meaſurable, and this meaſure is as it were an accident in that thing whoſe meaſure it is. But Meaſure meaſuring, is that which as a rule meaſures another thing. For this is alwaies without the thing which it numbers and meaſures.</p>
                  <p>Hence therfore a Queſtion ariſes: <hi>Whether Time be a meaſure or number,
<note place="margin">Time is a Meaſure Meaſured.</note> with which being it ſelf out of motion, we number moiton: or whether time be the meaſurable motion it ſelf?</hi> And although Authors ſay in both ſenſes that time is a number or meaſure: yet primarily and principally, Time is a formal meaſure, and a number which is numbred. <hi>Ariſtot.</hi> 1 <hi>Phyſ. c.</hi> 11. <hi>t.</hi> 102 <hi>and</hi> 12. <hi>t.</hi> 110. For the nature of time does not depend thereupon in that therewith we number other things; but herein it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, in that it is a motion numbred according to former and latter. Moreover to be a meaſure (<hi>viz.</hi> meaſuring or active) is a thing reſpective: but time is a thing ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute. It is not therefore eſſential to time to be a meaſure meaſuring. For as the eſſence of an Ell yard does not depend upon meaſuring, <hi>viz.</hi> that we ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with meaſure Cloth or any other thing: but herein in that it is a ſtick or other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial of ſo many or ſo many Foot long, to which it afterward happens that we mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſomwhat therewith: ſo the Eſſence of time conſiſts herein, that it is a motion numbred, and diſtinguiſhed according to former and latter, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is followed by this adjunct, <hi>viz.</hi> to become the meaſure of other things. So by time, which is deſcribed by the converſion of the Heavens, we meaſure the motions of other things; and by the parts of time, hours, daies, months, years, we meaſure ſome whol motion or other.</p>
                  <p>Nor becauſe time is a number;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Time is not a thing made. In Time two things are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.</hi> 1. <hi>Its Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</hi> 2. <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                     </note> and a number does not exiſt with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ut the Action of our mind: does it therefore follow, that time is only a feigned thing, and a notion of our Brains. For we muſt know that here are two things to be conſidered in time: Firſt its <hi>Eſſence,</hi> which is a certain duration of the parts of motion; The other is its Affliction or Adjunct, which is numerability and menſurability. The former, <hi>viz.</hi> the abſolute eſſence of time, does no waies depend upon our underſtanding, but it would remain though our underſtanding were gone. But menſurability does in ſome ſort depend upon the operation of our mind. For ſeeing the parts of Time are either actually meaſured; or have an aptitude to be numbred: according to the Act and as they are actually numbred, they depend upon the operation of our mind, which being taken away, yet the menſurability would remain nevertheleſs. Nor when our Minds compares the parts of time paſt and future, joyns them, and reckons; does it fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gn any thing which is not, but finds out the parts which were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore really in the motion. For as an Ell-yard, when we do not think thereof, has the Quantity of ſo many or ſo many Foot: yet the diſtinction and the marking them out, is the work of our mind and Art: ſo alſo Motion is of it ſelf in nature, according to ſucceſſion, without the operation of our minds; but the comparing of the parts going before and coming after, and the reckoning up the ſaid parts, is the Action of our Mind.</p>
                  <p>We muſt alſo in this place take notice: that although time be a reall thing,
<note place="margin">Time is no perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent thing</note> yet <hi>it is no permanent thing,</hi> which has its parts together actually preſent and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent: but it is a <hi>Succeſſive</hi> thing, which has no part actually exiſting, but all its parts in a continual flux and ſucceſſion, ſo that when one is paſt another preſently follows.</p>
                  <p>And we muſt alſo here enquire for better underſtanding of the definition:
<note place="margin">What that thing is whoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nd, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of Time?</note> 
                     <hi>what things motion it is which is meant in the ſaid definition?</hi> And we are to know, that chiefly and principally is underſtood the <hi>Motion of Heaven,</hi> which is of all others moſt known, moſt regular, uniform, and perpetual: but eſpecially the motion of the firſt Movable or <hi>Primum mobile,</hi> of the Sun and the Moon, by whoſe Motions Daies, Nights, Months and Years are deſcribed. But the common People attribute no time to the motion of the reſt of the Stars; becauſe their motions are to the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar unknown. Howbeit Mathematicians, do not quite omit the ſame. And as the motion of Heaven is univerſally common to al Nations: even ſo al Nations uſe this Time. Howbeit, we muſt not ſay, that time is not at all in other Motions; for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is former and latter in every motion and it may be accordingly numbred: in every motion, alſo there wil be time.</p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:35070:29"/>
                  <p> Out of what hath been ſaid another Queſtion ariſes;
<note place="margin">Whether there be one time only or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny?</note> 
                     <hi>Whether there be one time or many.</hi> To which that an anſwer may be given, we muſt know. Firſt That one may here be ſaid to be one in <hi>Number</hi> or in <hi>Sort.</hi> Secondly, That time as hath been ſaid is <hi>more</hi> or <hi>leſs</hi> principal, <hi>more</hi> principal is of the heavens, <hi>leſs</hi> principal and ſecondary, of all other motions. Thirdly, That there are two things in time, as the Schoolmen ſpeak, the one <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial</hi> which is motion, the other <hi>Formal</hi> which is number. Hence we anſwer to the Queſtion, That <hi>the firſt and principal time, is but one in Number.</hi> For as there is every where, and in all Nations but one motion of the Heaven: ſo is there but one time, depending thereupon. But if time be taken abſolutely, for the number of every motion, it is not one in number: but formally indeed it is one in Sort, but materially it is many being Multiplied, according to the Multiplication of motion. For as ſeven trees and ſeven Horſes, do not differ as they are ſeven, but as they are Horſes and Trees: even ſo, what ever motions are together, do not differ as they are numbred according to former and latter, but as they are peculiar motions. Time therefore is formally one with all, for the Nature of preſent, paſt, and future is common to all, and thoſe things which are diſtinguiſhed according to theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of time, they are alſo diſtinguiſhed according to time: and they which agree in any of theſe differences, they alſo agree in time although they differ other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies.</p>
                  <p>And now there comes another Queſtion;
<note place="margin">Whether in the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time Reſt ſhould be added?</note> 
                     <hi>Whether Reſt ſhould be added in the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of time?</hi> Becauſe not only the motions of things, but alſo their reſt, is num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred by time, and as wel reſt as motion, is in time. But no evident reaſon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades, that we ſhould mention Quiet in the definition of time. For time is of it ſelf the meaſure of motion, but of reſt, by accident. For Reſt becauſe it hath not former and latter, cannot of it ſelf be meaſured and numbred. For reſt is meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by time, either as it is a privation of motion, for the meaſure of privation and habit is one and the ſame: and a thing is ſaid to have reſted ſo long a time, as it has not been moved, or as it ſhould have been moved, if it had been moved all that while; or becauſe the reſt of one body is alwaies joyned with the motion of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by means whereof, the reſt is meaſured.</p>
                  <p>And ſeeing time and motion do hang ſo one upon another,
<note place="margin">Whether time do really dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from motion?</note> this Queſtion muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo be diſcuſſed: <hi>Whether time do really differ from motion.</hi> Now the ſenſe of this Queſtion muſt be firſt obſerved. For the Queſtion is not concerning the time of the <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> or firſt moveable, compared with the motions of other Bodies. For hereof there is no Queſtion, and all do grant, that the time of the motion of Heaven, differs really from the motion of other Bodies; ſeeing they are in ſeveral ſubjects; but the Queſtion is, <hi>Whether any time compared with that motion whoſe number and meaſure it is, do really differ therefrom.</hi> And although others do think otherwiſe: yet theirs ſeems to be the truer opinion, who conceive that motion does not really differ from time. For time is nothing but motion numbred, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to priority and poſteriority.</p>
                  <p>Finally,
<note place="margin">What we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by priority.</note> This remaines to be explained in our definition: what is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by fore and after or <hi>Priority</hi> and <hi>Poſteriority.</hi> Touching which we are to take notice, that fore and after are not taken here abſolutely, for a bare reſpect but as <hi>added to the ſubject, and concretly for the parts of motion, including ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</hi> For priority and poſteriority do in this place ſignifie nothing elſe, then the parts of motion numbred, according as they laſt, and one follows ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>The Parts of time are <hi>Paſt</hi> and <hi>Future:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The parts of time. Now no part of time. Whether time gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and corrupt.</note> which parts are both diſtinguiſhed and coupled by the <hi>preſent moment.</hi> Yet <hi>is the preſent moment no part of time:</hi> As a point is no part of a Line. For ſo is <hi>now</hi> to time, as a point is to a Line: now that which is continued <hi>is not made up of indiviſible parts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Concerning time we muſt not omit to enquire <hi>whether it be in the power of time to generate or corrupt things.</hi> And although it is commonly ſaid that time does produce and perfect ſome things, and corrupt other ſome, and the Poets common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, Time conſumes all things; Time is a devourer: Time is able to change all things, and that nothing is ſtonger then time, as may chiefly be ſeen in <hi>Ovid</hi> his 4. <hi>de Triſtibus, Eleg.</hi> 6. Yet we breifly anſwer with <hi>Scaliger</hi> in his 352. <hi>Exercitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> That <hi>Time as time hath no Force to effect any thing.</hi> For ſeeing that it is Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:35070:29"/>it acts nothing. And all thoſe effects are to be aſcribed to things, which are in or with Time. But Time it ſelf is therefore ſaid to corrupt or generate things, becauſe the Application of Natural Agents for the corruption or Generation of any thing happens in time. <hi>And ſo much for Time.</hi>

                  <p>Whereunto for Affinities ſake, though they do not properly belong to this place,
<note place="margin">Aevum.</note> I think fit to ad a few things touching <hi>Aevum</hi> and <hi>Eternity.</hi> The term <hi>Aevum,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in that ſignification as it is diſtinguiſhed from Eternity, and comes ſhort thereof as having a beginning; it was not uſed by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> nor the ancient Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>eticks and Platoniſts: Yet is it at this day very much uſed by School divines and other noble Phyloſophers, who diſtinguiſh it both from Time and Eternity, taking it for ſuch a duration as hath had a beginning, but ſhall have no end, which they attribute to Angels. Now touching this ſame <hi>Evum</hi> or <hi>Aeveternity</hi> although there are ſundry opinions of Authors: yet this ſhal ſuffice us to ſay in this place; that all the Nature of <hi>Aevum</hi> or <hi>Aeveternity,</hi> does conſiſt herein, that <hi>it is the Meaſure of the duration of thoſe things, which have a beginning but no end:</hi> or as ſome will have it, <hi>It is the duration of things which have no end but have had a beginning.</hi> Now the way to meaſure this <hi>Aevum</hi> wherewith we are beſt acquainted, is by its coexiſtency, as they ſpeak, and its relation to Time. For we ſay the Angels have dured 5661. years, which is the Time ſince the worlds Creation. Hence it is manifeſt, that <hi>Aevum</hi> differs from time and Eternity: from time in reſpect of the end which Time hath, but <hi>Aevum</hi> or <hi>Aeveternity</hi> hath not; from Eternity, in reſpect of its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which <hi>Evum</hi> hath, but Eternity hath not. Which <hi>Leo Hebraeus</hi> expreſſed in his <hi>third Dialogue of Love:</hi> The <hi>Aeveternity</hi> of Angels (ſaies he) is placed in the conſines of Time and Eternity.</p>
                  <p>But Eternity, although there are other ſignifications thereof:
<note place="margin">Eternity what it is</note> yet properly it ſignifies a <hi>Duration which hath neither beginning nor Bnd,</hi> In which ſenſe, we fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently meet with this definition thereof in <hi>Boetins:</hi> Eternity is a total and perfect poſſeſſion of a boundleſs Life, all at once. For all the Eſſence of eternity conſiſts in immutability or unchangeableneſs. For that which is <hi>Eternal</hi> neither begins, nor ends, nor is any way changed; but <hi>is alwaies the ſame, and hath its whol Eſſence all at once.</hi> Whence there reſults two proprieties of eternity, Firſt,
<note place="margin">Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</note> that it hath no bound, in reſpect of beginning or end: Secondly, that it is all at once. For though we attribute daies and years to etermity, yet we do it only for our better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings ſake. All which <hi>Plotinus</hi> conſidering, in his 3. <hi>Ennead. Book</hi> 9. <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. he ſaies, <hi>Eternity is a life all together, alwaies wholly preſent, and not now one part and after another.</hi> But theſe things belong not to this place. I conclude therefore with <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> in his 12. <hi>B. de Civitate Dei, Ch.</hi> 12. Nothing laſts long which hath once an end and al the bounded ſpaces of all Ages, if compared to boundleſs eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, are not to be accounted ſmal, but nothing at all. Six hundred Millions of years or that ſum multiplied by as many, ſo that there were no name for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct or total Sum, yet all compared to <hi>Eternity</hi> is nothing; and if the ſaid ſum be ſubſtracted from Eternity, not once or twice, but as often as any accountants are able to ſubſtract the ſame, yet ſhould they never reach to the beginning of eternity, which hath no beginning.</p>

                  <p>This being the ſignification of this word (which though new to the dul multitude, yet was known to wiſe men to whom <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> wrote and not to pedants, as <hi>Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> in his 307. <hi>Exercit.

                  <p>To theſe Greek words, the Latin word <hi>Actus</hi> does anſwer, which does not,

                     </note> in this place, ſignifie Action only; But that, <hi>from which every thing is ſaid to be what it is.</hi> For as <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaies in his 359. <hi>Exercitation Sect.</hi> 2. we muſt borrow ordinary words to ſigniſie abſtruſe matters: which ſeem harſh to Novices, and ridiculous to curious Ciceronians.

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telecheia ſignifies in the place. An act is twofold.</note> neither for the perfect form, nor for the operation alone; but <hi>for a certain imperfect Act.</hi> For there is a twofold <hi>Act,</hi> one <hi>perfect,</hi> which when it comes, it expel<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> al Aptitude or potenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, and leaves none of it behind: another <hi>imperfect,</hi> with which there alwaies remains ſomwhat of poſſibility; which when it is taken away, the Act is alſo taken away; and ſuch an Act is Motion. For ſeeing that is called moveable, which may be moved: motion is the fulfiling and perfecting of that poſſibility, in regard of which a thing is called moveable, and makes that it hath not only a poſſibility of being moved, but that it is now really moved, indeed and in truth. Howbeit this <hi>Entelecheia</hi> does not take away al poſſibility, but only ſo perfects the Body move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that it retaines yet the poſſibility of being more moved, until at length it come to the utmoſt term of motion, to which while it is moved, it muſt needs have the power of motion. For truly the thing moveable, while it is in the term from which, is not yet moved; but while it is in the term to which, it is moved no longer, but now it is moved, and ceaſes from motion. But then it is truly ſaid to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, when it is now in the Act, in which before, when it was in the term from which, it was not, but only had a poſſibility of attaining the ſame; and when it yet tends to that further act, which in reſpect of the term from which, it hath not, but may attain. For if it had already the laſt term, it would be no longer moved thereunto. For which cauſe it is alſo ſaid in the definition of Motion: that Motion is the <hi>Act of that which is in poſſibility.</hi> For whatſoever is moved, as may appear by the premiſes, is part in act and partly in poſſibility. In act, in reſpect of the Form and of that term which by motion it hath already gained, and actually poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes: in poſſibility, in reſpect of that which it hath not yet obtained, and for the ſake whereof it is ſtill moved. For examples ſake: Water which is in heating, is ſaid to be moved, that is to ſay altered. For it hath already ſome degrees of heat, and has the poſſibility of gaining yet more, and does likewiſe gain them by growing warmer: and when it has attained all the degrees, it is then termed hot water; but is not ſaid any longer to grow hot, or to be altered and moved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Motion</hi> is there fore neither a pure act, nor a pure poſſibility,
<note place="margin">Motion is an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect act.</note> 
                     <hi>But a certain mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and imperfect act.</hi> And in every motion are found theſe three things: <hi>Some of the Form,</hi> which is by motion already attained; a <hi>power</hi> of receiving that form more perfectly and in a greater meaſure; a <hi>Flux</hi> and Progreſs or Tendenay to the ſaid Form. Finally <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> adds in the definition, <hi>in as much as it is in poſſibility,</hi> to ſignifie that motion is not made in reſpect of that Form and term, which the moveable thing hath already attained. For a thing is no longer moved for the ſake of that, which it already poſſeſſes; but for the ſake of that term which it has not yet attained, and which it has a power to obtain. From what hath been ſaid,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:35070:31"/>'tis eaſie to gather wherein the Eſſence and formality of Motion does conſiſt.</p>
                  <p>For ſeeing there are in every motion two things,
<note place="margin">Two things in Motion.</note> one the form it ſelf flowing; the other, the flux of the form: Motion formally, is neither ſimply a form, nor a form flowing, but a continual acquiſition of Form, and the flux thereof, partly already acquired and partly to be acquired. For to be moved, is not to have the form; but, to be moved, is to tend to the form.</p>
                  <p>Moreover,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>To na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are required.</hi> 1 <hi>A Mover.</hi>
                     </note> to all Phyſical or Natural motion, theſe things are required.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. <hi>A Mover:</hi> For every thing which is moved, is moved by ſome other thing. For it is impoſſible that the ſame thing in reſpect of the ſame form, ſhould be in Act and in Poſſiblity: But that which moves, or introduces any form, does actually poſſeſs the ſame; that which is moved has only a power to receive the form. And therefore it is not the ſame thing which moves and is moved. Howbeit touching this Axiome we muſt obſerve, that it is only to be underſtood of <hi>material things and natural bodies compleat, and of the motion of the who! compound;</hi> and that the intent of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the 7. <hi>Phyſick. cap.</hi> 1. when he delivered this axiome was to deduce natural motion to one firſt Principle, and thereby to prove that there was one firſt mover, by which as by a firſt Principle, all bodies are moved: otherwiſe, unleſs this axio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>A movable</hi> or <hi>thing moved,</hi> and hence every thing that naturally moves it ſelf is divided into a part moving, and a part moved. Now that which moves muſt needs be with that which is moved, or that which primarily does move any thing, without the Intervention of any intermediate agent, ought to touch that thing which it moves, and to be very neer unto the ſame. For we cannot ſo much as imagine, how any thing can ſuffer from that, by which it is not touched, or how any thing can act upon that which it does not touch. For ſince operation follows the Eſſence of a thing: where the thing is not, there it's operation cannot be. For though the firſt mover be abſent from the thing moved in reſpect of its ſubſtance, yet is it joyned therwith, by the Virtue which it ſends forth. And thus <hi>the next mover and the thing moved, are alwaies together, and every action is cauſed by touching.</hi> Now motion is in the thing moved. For the Act is in that thing, whoſe act it is. Yet is not the action of the mover different from the act of the thing moved, but there is one act of the Agent and the Patient, For it is one and the ſame thing which the mover produces by acting,
<note place="margin">The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the mover and the Paſſion of the moved are but one motion.</note> and which is produced in the Patient by ſuffering. And <hi>the Action of the mover and the paſſion of the moved are one only motion,</hi> not really di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct one from another; but only <hi>reſpectively,</hi> viz. in as much as the ſame Act, does proceed from the mover as from its Principle, and is received by the Moved, as the Patient: which is wel expreſt by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the 3. <hi>Phyſ. ch.</hi> 3. <hi>t.</hi> 22. <hi>For to be the Action of this in that, and of that from this, differs reſpectively.</hi> So that the ſame moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as it proceeds from the Agent, is an action, as it is received by the Patient, a Paſſion. And the heating of water by fire, is but one action: which as it proceeds from the Agent, <hi>viz.</hi> the fire, is called an Action, as it is received by the water, a Paſſion. And therefore Action and Paſſion are in one Subject. For ſeeing paſſion is in the Patient, and action really differs not from paſſion: the action muſt alſo needs be in the ſame Patient. Yet this muſt be obſerved that we ſpake here of a tranſient action: but not of an immanent action, which abides in the Agent.</p>

For though one motion may have many terms to which: yet they are not the laſt &amp; total, or they are not primarily intended and for themſelves, or they are not intrinſecal. But in motion we are chiefly to regard the term to which. For that is it for the ſake whereof the movable is moved, and from it the Unity, Diſtinction and Contrariety of Motion are chiefly taken.

But that a motion may be one in number, <hi>three</hi> things are requiſite: one movable, one term to which; and one continued time. To which a fourth may be added, the Term from which. For one motion cannot proceed from divers Terms.</p>
                  <p>What is the Nature of Motion has been explained hitherto,
<note place="margin">Motion &amp; Mutation differ.</note> it remains that we now ſhew you what are the Sorts of Motions. Where in the firſt place you are to take notice, that there is a difference betwixt <hi>mutation</hi> and <hi>motion. Metabole</hi> or Mutation is of larger extent, and ſignifies every variation of a thing, whether the terms in reſpect of which the thing is varied, be poſitive and contrary, or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictary: but <hi>Kineſis</hi> or Motion properly ſo called, is not of ſo large an extent, but is converſant betwixt terms (upon which, eſpecially the term from which its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture chiefly depends) which are contrary, or if mediate, yet having the nature of contraries.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Motion</hi> therefore <hi>properly ſo called is converſant betwixt contraries.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Motion is made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries.</note> Now we term ſuch things in this place contraries, not only which do moſt of all differ under the ſame kind: but whatſoever poſitive terms, by the coming of one of which another is changed, whether it be in reſpect of contrary qualities, or according to intention, or according to extenſion. Whatſoever therefore ought to be reckoned for a term of motion, muſt have theſe two conditions. Firſt that it have a contrary in ſuch a manner as has been ſaid; ſo that the motion muſt paſs from one contrary as the Term <hi>a quo</hi> from which, unto the other contrary as the term <hi>ad quem,</hi> to which. Moreover, that muſt of neceſſity be attained, which terminates the motion of it ſelf, and not without the change of the Subject, which is performed by real action and paſſion.</p>
                  <p>From which may eaſily be gathered,
<note place="margin">Motions are only in Quantity, Quality &amp; Place.</note> that true motion is <hi>only in three Predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> viz. <hi>Quantity, Quality,</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi</hi> or Place; or that in reſpect of that thing to which the motion tends, it may be reduced to theſe three Predicaments. For both the forms of theſe Predicaments have contrariety, and poſitive oppoſite terms; nor can their change happen without the change of the Subject.</p>
                  <p>But Generation and Corruption which are changes in the ſubſtance of a thing,
<note place="margin">Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Corruption are not properly Motion.</note> are not properly Motions. For that Contrariety neceſſary to motion, is not found in ſubſtances. Moreover, ſince every thing which is moved is an actual Being; but that which is generated is no actual Being (for if it were already, there were no need that it ſhould be generated) therefore <hi>Generation cannot be a Motion.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>Every motion is continued and performed in time:</hi> but generation is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in time, but in a moment, and therefore alſo it cannot be a Motion. For ſubſtantial forms being indiviſible and not capable of more or leſs, cannot be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively acquired and by piecemeal.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit we muſt here obſerve,
<note place="margin">A two fold Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of Ginerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</note> that Generation and corruption are taken <hi>two waies,</hi> either only for the acquiſition or loſs of a ſubſtantial form, without prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent alteration: or for the introduction of a form, with alteration which went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſame. Generation and Corruption taken in the former Senſe, are no moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but are performed in an Inſtant: but in the latter ſenſe they may be allowed for Motions.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, this muſt not be omitted neither. That <hi>Suceeſſion in motion is conſidered two waies:</hi> Primarily and chiefly as was ſaid before, <hi>in reſpect of the form,</hi> which ſeeing it may be intended and remitted, and has certain degrees, in reſpect of which it is capable of more and leſs, it therefore ſucceſſively acquires thoſe degrees, <hi>viz.</hi> one before, another after. But ſince the ſubſtantial form has no ſuch degrees, it
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:35070:32"/>cannot be intended, nor remitted, nor is it ſucceſſively introduced, but in an inſtant and all at once. Afterward there is ſaid to be a ſucceſſion <hi>in reſpect of the Subject,</hi> which is movable: which ſucceſſion others ſeem to call extenſion. For ſince a thing movable is diviſible, and has ſome parts formore others hinder: and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver acts firſt upon the formore parts and which are neereſt it ſelf, and afterwards upon the hinder and more remote: alſo in this manner we may grant that Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is made ſucceſſivly. But doth theſe ſucceſſions are conſidered, in motion properly ſo called: but the former holds more of the nature thereof: which being abſent from Generation it cannot be called motion.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, it is evident, that there is no motion in <hi>Relation, Action, Paſſion, When,</hi> and <hi>Habit,</hi> the Predicaments ſo called. For thoſe mutations which are made in them, do either not happen with the change of the ſubject, or not of themſelves primarily, but conſequently and by accident.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Motion</hi> therefore <hi>properly is only made out of one ſubject into another:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The ſorts of Motion.</note> and there are three ſorts thereof. In Quantity there is Augmentation and Diminution. For theſe two mutations have no common name. In Quality, there is Alteration. In Place, there is local motion from place to place.</p>
                  <p>To Motion <hi>Reſt</hi> is oppoſed,
<note place="margin">Reſt what it is.</note> which is the <hi>Privation of Motion in that thing, which is naturally apt to be moved;</hi> and in as much as motion is made to attain reſt, it may alſo be ſaid to be the end and perfection of motion. So a body, when it has attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned its natural magnitude, ceaſes growing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſt</hi> is either <hi>natural,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Reſt two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</note> whoſe principle is internal, and to which the <hi>movable</hi> is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally enclined: So the Earth is naturally moved to the Centre, and reſts there. Or <hi>Violent,</hi> whoſe Principle is external, when a body is kept by force in a place not natural thereunto; as when a ſtone or clod of Earth, is hung up in the Air.</p>

                  <p>That which is by the Greeks termed <hi>Coſmos,</hi> becauſe of its abſolute and perfect Elegancy and Ornament the Latins call <hi>Mundus</hi> for the ſame cauſe:

                        <hi>The ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the word</hi> Mundus</note> which word becauſe it ſignifies a thing which is abſolute, perfect and comprehending in it many things orderly ranked, many things are ſo termed. <hi>Marſilius Ficinus</hi> on the 3. <hi>Book of Plotin. Bnead</hi> 1. makes two worlds, one intelligible, being the divine mind, the Pattern and Idea of this ſenſible world: the other ſenſible, <hi>viz.</hi> this which we behold, being the Image of the divine Pattern. Others do again divide theſe two worlds, and make more worlds. The firſt is the Archetype of Intelligible world, which is the divine mind or God himſelf, who contains in him the patterns and Ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as of all things: the ſecond is the angelical world, made up of the multitudes of Angels rank'd in their Hierarchies: the third is the Elementary, which is made up
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:35070:32"/>of Heaven and the Elements: the fourth is the great world, which contains alcrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted things, both corporeal and incorporeal: the fift, is the little world or <hi>Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſme,</hi> which is Man.</p>
                  <p>We are in this place chiefly to treat of that world which conſiſts of Heaven and Earth and the Bodies therein contained, and by another name is called <hi>to pan,</hi> the Univerſe becauſe it comprehends al natural bodies, &amp; to which the term <hi>Mundus</hi> or World does chiefly belong and which in regard of its order was given it by <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> as <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaies in the 2. of his <hi>de placit. Phyloſop. ch</hi> 7. though we may doubt hereof, becauſe the word <hi>Coſmos</hi> is read up and down in the writings of <hi>Hermes Triſmegiſtus.</hi> For this univerſe is truly <hi>Coſmos</hi> or <hi>Mundus,</hi> that is to ſay adorned, orderly marſhalled, and beautiful.

                  </p>
                  <p>And as there are ſundry ſignifications of the term world, ſo there are ſundry defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions or deſcriptions thereof, which <hi>Franc.

But thoſe are of all other moſt pertinent and moſt fit for this place, which the Author of the <hi>Book de Mundo</hi> has in his 2. Chap. (for whether it be <hi>Ariſtotle's</hi> or <hi>Theophraſtus's,</hi> or of ſome other Author is a queſtion, of which ſee <hi>Ludovicus Vives</hi> upon <hi>Auſtin de Civitate Dei Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>Collegium Conimbri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe</hi> in the proaeme to <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Phyſicks queſt. 5. art. 4.) the firſt is this, <hi>The world is a Fabrick framed of the Heaven and Earth and the Natures in them contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> The ſecond is this, <hi>The world is the Order and Diſpoſure of all things, which is preſerved by and through God:</hi> which may thus I conceive be fitly joyned both in one. <hi>The world is that ſame orderly Diſpoſure of all natural Bodies, proceeding from God and by him preſerved.</hi>
                  </p>

And the world is compounded of the Heaven, the four Elements, mixt bodies, inanimate and animate, mettals, things dug out of the ground, Plants, and Anima is or living Creatures.</p>
                  <p>But what is the Form of the world is not ſo evident,
<note place="margin">Touching the form of the world ſundry O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions.</note> and there are ſundry opinions thereabouts. For ſome ſay God is the Form of the world; others a ſoul common to the whol Univerſe; others, the Heaven; others, its Figure; others, Order. But among theſe opinions, two have at this time the preheminence: the one is that which attributes a certain ſoul to the world for its Form: the other is that which makes or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be the form of the world. That the world has a ſoul is an old opinion, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by many moſt renowned men. It is countenanced by <hi>Hermes Triſmegiſtus, Zoro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſter, and Orpheus.</hi> So in his Book called <hi>Nous pros Erme, All things</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>are ful of ſoul.</hi> And in his Book <hi>de Intellectione &amp; ſenſu,</hi> he attributes a proper Sence and Intelligence unto the world. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> held the ſame, with <hi>Plato</hi> and his Follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, who oft times cal the world a living Creature, and aſſign it a common ſoul, which every where through Land and Water, contains in it ſelf ſpiritual and quickening ſeeds; and of it ſelf ingenders, wherever corporeal ſeeds are wanting; and alſo cheriſhes the ſeeds left by Animals, and of a putrified Grape-kernel en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genders a various, orderly and precious Vine; which wherever there wants a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator, and accidental qualities ſeem only the Cauſe of Generation, ſupplies the place of a generating Subſtance; as <hi>Marſilius Ficinus</hi> ſhews at large, <hi>in his</hi> 4. <hi>Book of Platonick Theologue Ch.</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p>But the Peripetaticks like not of this Opinion. For ſeeing no evident reaſon perſwades the ſame, nor is there any neceſſity that it ſhould be ſo; they neither attribute to the world any informing Subſtantial form, nor one common ſoul, nor do they think it ſit to multiply things without great occaſion. For no Action does plainly appear in the whol world, as proceeding from any peculiar ſoul common to the whol world: but all operations do proceed from peculiar and diſtinct forms. And therefore ſince all parts of the world have their peculiar forms, there needs no common form to knit them together; ſeeing without it, the ſeveral forms can perform their own operations. Moreover, if there were one form informing the world, the other forms, muſt either be parts thereof, or be informed thereby,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:35070:33"/>both which are abſurd. They cannot be parts; for all formes are not univocal, and differ more then in kind, nor can they make up one whol: And one form in number, cannot conſtitute diſtinct things, ſuch as Natural things are. For ſince the form gives unity as wel as being: all Natural things ſhould be termed one rather then many. And that the other formes ſhould be informed by this, is alſo many waies abſurd. Nor is there any reaſon to beleeve that this form of the world, comes upon the other forms, juſt as the form of a living Creature comes upon the form of a mixt Body. For if this were ſo, it ſhould be more excellent and more perf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ct then the reſt of the forms: which the Platoniſts nevertheleſs, will not grant. For the Soul of the world does not include more and more excellent faculties, then the forms and Souls of all Natural Bodies.</p>
                  <p>And therefore the Peripateticks deny that the world is one, by the unity of a Form informing; and they attribute thereunto only an unity of order of thoſe things, which proceeding from one principle, do tend unto the ſame as their end, agreeing one with another and with it; becauſe all things come from one and tend to one,
<note place="margin">The Form of the world.</note> as <hi>J. C. Scaliger</hi> ſaies in his 6. <hi>Exercitation, S.</hi> 2. The Form therefore of the world is <hi>the order or orderly diſpoſure of Natural Bodies</hi> Howbeit, we are here to obſerve, as Number is twofold, the one numbering, or wherewith we number, the other numbered, which is nothing but the things themſelvs which reckoned: ſo there is a <hi>twofold order,</hi> an <hi>order ordering,</hi> which is an accident, and the mutual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the parts one to another, or as <hi>Auguſtin</hi> defines it in his <hi>de Civit. Dei B.</hi> 19. <hi>Ch.</hi> 13. a Diſpoſure which among things like and unlike gives every one its place: and an order <hi>ordered,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe of the world.</note> which is nothing but the things themſelves aptly diſpoſed, and ſuch is the world. For natural Bodies, as they are aptly diſpoſed, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate of the condition of one firſt principle, and mutually accompliſh and cheriſh one another, do make one orderly Syſtem, which is called the world.</p>
                  <p>As to the efficient Cauſe of the world, though the Ep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cureans were ſo mad as to think and ſay that this beautiful Theatre of the world was made by a blind and fortunate concourſe of Atomes: yet all ſound Phyloſophers agree in this, that this world depends upon the <hi>moſt good and great God,</hi> as the only firſt principle of all principles. For as <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his <hi>de Civit Dei B.</hi> 11. <hi>ch.</hi> 4. ſaies, The world it ſelf, by its moſt orderly mutability and mobility, and the moſt beautiful Feature of all viſible things, does after a ſort ſilently proclaim both that it was made, and by none but God, nor could he made by any but him, who is unutterably and inviſibly great, and unſpeakably and inviſibly fair. And <hi>Scaliger</hi> in his 3. <hi>Exercitation,</hi> ſhews that <hi>Simplicious, Philoponus, Ammonius, Avonroes,</hi> and many other renowned Men, neither fewer in number nor of leſs Authority, then thoſe of the contrary foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh opinion, did hold that the world depended upon God, as its Efficient Cauſe: and at laſt, thus concludes. For if by his Providence all things are governed (which no man in his wits can deny) it neceſſarily follows, that he was the maker of al. For if he made not the world: then he received it made by another, either as borrowed, or by force, or by ſale, or as a pawn, or hired, or by lawful ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, or ſeazing upon it when empty, or by command, as a Miniſter, Servant and Mercenary from his Lord. All which are meer trifling and Impious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits.</p>
                  <p>As for what concernes the end of the World:
<note place="margin">The End of the world.</note> The <hi>End</hi> moves the Agent to act. But there was nothing before the world ſaving God alone. Nothing therefore mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved God to create the world, but he himſelf moved himſelf. and therefore he cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated it, that he might communicate his infinite goodneſs. Which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> has neatly expreſſed in theſe words, <hi>de Civit. Dei Book</hi> 11. <hi>Ch.</hi> 21. <hi>Three things we ought cheifly to enquire concerning the Creature, who made it, by what he made it, and wherefore he made it. God ſaid</hi> (quoth he) <hi>let there be light, and there won light, and God ſaw the Light that it was good. If therefore we ask who made it? it was God. If wherefore be made it? becauſe it is good. There is no more excellent Author then God, no more efficacious Art, then the word of God, no better Cauſe, then that what is good might be made by the good God.</hi> Nor does <hi>Plato</hi> render any other cauſe, why God made the world, but becauſe he is good. For it is the property of goodneſs to communicate it ſelf. And this is the end of creating the world.</p>
                  <p>But what the <hi>End</hi> is of the world already conſtituted and exiſting, is elegantly
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:35070:33"/>taught us by <hi>Hermes Triſmegiſtus,</hi> in his Book <hi>de Pietate &amp; Phyloſophia. Firſt there was God, then the World, then Mankind; the world for Mankind and Mankind for God.</hi> For ſince every end is good, and the perfection of that thing whoſe end it is; and God is the ultimate and moſt perfect of all things:
<note place="margin">God is the end of all things.</note> God muſt needs be the end of all things, and all things are for that one, which is for none but himſelf: and al things ſtand in need of God, Both to be and to be well: Man therefore was made for God, and the world for Man. But how all ſorts of things are made for Man, is not ſo plain. For <hi>Scaliger</hi> cals them the Enemies of Truth, who will have all things to be made for the uſe of Man. For what profit hath Man from Fleas and Wiglice? 'Tis truly ridiculous to ſay, that Fleas are made to ſuck out the unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable blood, and Wiglice to awake us in the night, that we may fal to our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers. Nor does <hi>Scaliger</hi> allow that ſome ſorts of things were made only for varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſake, and to ſtir us up to admiration: but he determines that God made all things for ſome certain end. For variety and bare ornament, is not the end, nor the Perfection of the Univerſe, but a way only to that perfection. For from fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry ſorts of things orderly diſpoſed, the perfection of the Univerſe does ariſe. <hi>Scaliger</hi> therefore himſelf thus reſolves the matter: that Man is a little world, and as it were the Rule and meaſure of other living Creatures; yea and the Prince of al. But he could not be Prince unleſs he were ſuch as he is, <hi>viz.</hi> In the middle: nor could he be in the middle, unleſs betwixt extreams. Therefore the extreams were made that he might be in the middeſt: and if any of the extreams, or thoſe things ſeated betwixt the middle and the extreams were wanting, there would be a vacui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty amongſt the forms. Which is much more abſurd, then that there ſhould be a <hi>Vacuum</hi> without a Body. For ſeeing the moſt good God is ful of himſelf, and the world as the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> ſay, is Gods Statue or Standing Image: it muſt alſo beful, and have no defect either in ſorts, or Quantity. And therefore if even the ſmalleſt thing were wanting in the world, the Univerſe would be no longer the Univerſe, and the world would ceaſe to be the world, that is to ſay, beautiful, orderly ranckt, and perfect.</p>
                  <p>And thus far we have known the world by its Cauſes; it remaines that we take a view of the cheif adjuncts thereof, and diſcuſs the controverſies raiſed touching them. Now in the firſt place comes Eternity; and the queſtion is,
<note place="margin">Whether the world be eternal.</note> 
                     <hi>Whether this world be Eeternal or not?</hi> This queſtion is much canvaſed by the diſputes of many Men, and the opinions of Phyloſophers concerning the ſame have been various; ſome affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the world had a beginning and ſhall have an end; others that it had a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning but ſhal never have an end; and others again that it never had beginning nor ſhal ever have end. That we may therefore diſintangle our ſelves from ſo great a variety of opinions, we muſt firſt obſerve this: that the chief queſtion in this place is not: whether God made the world. For though the madneſs of ſome hath been ſo great, that they durſt ſay that this world was made by Chance;
<note place="margin">The World was not made by chance.</note> yet al ſound Phyloſophers, do agree that God is the author of the world: and therefore the Author of the Book <hi>de Mundo, Chap.</hi> 6. ſaies Elegantly and Piouſly: <hi>It is an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſaying ſpred amongſt all Men from their Anceſtors, that all things were made both of God and by God; nor can any Natural thing be ſufficiently furniſhed to perſiſt in ſafety, if it be left to its own ſaveguard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without the tuition of God.</hi> And that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf knew the moſt good and great God to be the maker of the world, and that he expreſſed as much in words, is the judgment of moſt worthy Phyloſophers. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily if the world were not made by God, it muſt be made by it ſelf: which is abſurd. For a finite thing cannot be the firſt being; and every finite thing depends upon ſome other: nor are there many prime, infinite, eternal beings.</p>
                  <p>Here therefore the queſtion is; <hi>Whether the world be from eternal, or were created in the beginning of Time?</hi> The moſt renowned Ancient Phyloſophers have held, that the world had a beginning. But <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> held that this world hath been from all eternity, as himſelf witneſſes, in his 1. <hi>de Caelo ch.</hi> 10. <hi>t.</hi> 102.

                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:35070:34"/>in his 61. <hi>Exercitation S.</hi> 6. ſaies that Religion only does perſwade him, that the world had a beginning and ſhal at laſt be conſumed by fire. Yet he concludes in his 77. <hi>Exercitation, S.</hi> 5. that becauſe God is the efficient cauſe of the world, it muſt needs have had a Beginning and not be eternal. For whatſoever is made, is after its efficient cauſe, and nothing that is made is of equal durance with its maker, for ſo it ſhould not be made. This Argument others alſo uſe, and ſay that for a thing to be made and to be eternal implies a contradiction. For that which was made, ſomtimes was not. And they ſay that Eternity is the duration of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, nor can any creature be Coeternal with its Creator.</p>
                  <p>Nor are thoſe Arguments which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and his followers bring to prove the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity of the world, ſuch as mans wit cannot anſwer and refute. And I conceive it is well ſaid, that no reaſon brought againſt our Faith is true, or can be: becauſe truth is not contrary to truth. For though things of Faith are above the order of Nature, yet they are not contrary thereunto. For even here, theſe who contend for the eternity of the world, do cheifly build upon two fall foundations: one, that Creation is impoſſible, and that even the firſt cauſe cannot produre any thing out of nothing: the other, that God acts by the neceſſity of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>Now that Creation is not impoſſible and that the firſt Cauſe can produce ſomwhat out of nothing,
<note place="margin">Creation is poſſible ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,</note> may be evinced even by the light of Nature. For ſuch as is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a thing, ſuch is its operation: but the immortal God, ſince in reſpect of his eſſence he depends upon none, and needs no outward thing, neither does he need any external thing to be preſuppoſed in his acting. Moreover God is the cauſe of all things, and nothing except God hath its being of it ſelf, but all things depend on God. And in very deed, they who deny creation, and ſay it is impoſſble God ſhould make any thing of nothing, and yet grant that God is the Efficient cauſe of the world (for they muſt needs grant that) do contradict themſelves. For if God be the efficient cauſe of the world: doubtleſs, he made it of nothing. For beſides God and the world, there is nothing out of which he ſhould produce it. Others bring more reaſons to prove the ſame. And in truth, they who deny that God could produce ſomthing out of nothing. they deny God to be God, that is to ſay, that his power and perfection is inſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>And that God acts freely and not compelled by his Nature,
<note place="margin">God made the world freely.</note> and that he moſt free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly produced this world, is not contrary to humane reaſon. For ſince God is a moſt perfect being, depending upno none, ſtanding in need of none, ſelf ſufficient, <hi>Autexouſios, Autagathos,</hi> and (which word was elegantly invented by <hi>Scaliger Exercit.</hi> 365. <hi>S.</hi> 2. <hi>Autautos,</hi> ſelf, of himſelf: the wil of God cannot neceſſarily deſire any Creature, nor can he neceſſarily produce any, nor can his power be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by any thing: but himſelf moſt freely wils, what by his wiſdom he knows to be beſt: and he could, if he pleaſed, have made this world much ſooner or later, or not at all. Yet he does alwaies, that which is beſt. Nor, becauſe he made the world in the beginning, was his will therefore changed. For from eternity, it was his pleaſure to produce the world, then when he produced the ſame. Nor muſt we think, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks in his <hi>De Civitate Dei B.</hi> 11. <hi>Ch.</hi> 5. That any thing hapned accidentally to God, in that he made the world rather then, then in former times; ſince the former times had paſſed equally through infinite ſpaces, neither had there been any difference, why one time ſhould be choſen rather then another. And as he ſaies, <hi>in the ſaid</hi> 11. <hi>Book, Ch.</hi> 12. where he handles this argument ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently; that which we now enquire after five thouſand and od years, poſterity may ask with the ſame Curioſity ſix hundred thouſand years hence, if this mortal condition of men born and dying ſhal continue ſo long, and they retain their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh infirmity. Thoſe who were before us in the infancy of the world might move the ſame Queſtion. Yea and the firſt man himſelf, the day after, or the ſame day he was created, might enquire why he was made no ſooner. For indeed, as he ſaies in the ſame place, all the bounded ſpaces of Ages, if compared to boundleſs Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, are nothing.</p>
                  <p>As it appears from Scriptures,
<note place="margin">The world ſhal have an end.</note> that the world had a beginning: ſo they alone per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us that this World ſhal have an End; nor is any Phyloſophical reaſon ſtrong enough to prove the ſame. For though it be true which <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaies in his 61. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercitation, S.</hi> 5. and <hi>Exercit.</hi> 307. <hi>S.</hi> 20. that all things becauſe they have not the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:35070:34"/>cauſe of their being from themſelves, but depend upon another, are of themſelves mutable, and corruptible; but are not corrupted, becauſe God wil not have it ſo: yet true it is, that the world left to it ſelf, with that common and ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of God which now it has, may for ever endure, nor does it of its own accord tend to corruption: but it ſhall end by the free command of God, <hi>viz.</hi> when he ſhal withdraw from it his ordinary aſſiſtance, and change it into a better condition.

                  <p>Nor is it much leſs controverted: <hi>Whether this world be one.</hi>

For ſome have held the world to be but one, others that there are many worlds, and they either like or unlike one another. For ſome were of the opinion, that there were other worlds beſides this, in ſome of which there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sun nor Moon; in others, that there is Sun and Moon greater then thoſe in this world; and in ſome many Suns; alſo that there are ſome Worlds void of al Plants, Animals, and Moiſture: and <hi>Metrodorus</hi> did ſay, that it is as abſurd that there ſhould be but one world, as that in a vaſt field there ſhould grow only one Ear of Corn.</p>
                  <p>In this variety of opinions, we beleeve there is but one world: but we hold ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting aſide what may be urged from our religion, that there is no Phyloſophical rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſtrong enough to prove the ſame. For ſure enough God can and could have made more worlds: But whether or no he will make more: none can tel but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſeeing neither ſenſe nor reaſon can inform us. For as for the reaſons every where alleadged by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and others for the unity of the world; they are not ſuch as do certainly prove the ſame. Which <hi>Plutarch,</hi> beſides others, does ſhew in <hi>his Book of the Ceaſing of Oracles,</hi> and Mirandula <hi>in Exam. Vanit. Doct. Gent.

For ſo the parts being of one and the ſame Nature would hang together and would not go out of their world; all heavy bodies would ſeek their own Centre, and that lighter would ſly upwards, and the ſame may be judged of the reſt, proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit this one world does ſufficiently demonſtrate the goodneſs of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he made it of his own accord, not being obliged ſo to do; alſo it ſhews his great power, becauſe he could make it of nothing; and exceeding great it ſhewes his Wiſdom, becauſe he hath made al things ſo admirably and with ſuch rare skill.</p>
                  <p>And although we beleeve this world to be one;
<note place="margin">The World is perfect.</note> yet we hold the ſame to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, with ſuch a kind of perfection as a Creature is capable of. For it was made by a perfect Artiſt according to a perfect Pattern: nor is there any thing wanting, in the abſolute perfection of the things whereof it is made up; nor in their Variety.

<note place="margin">Whether the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven have matter in it.</note> 
                     <hi>Whether it is of the ſame Nature with that which is here below.</hi> And although as to the former queſtion, there are ſcruples good ſtore on al ſides: yet that opinion ſeemes to me more probable which attributes matter to the Heaven and I conceive it was well ſaid of <hi>Scaliger</hi> in his 359. <hi>Exercitation, Sect.</hi> 11. <hi>to make a Body without matter,</hi> is all one as to make a dream without ſleep: or as he hath it in his 1 <hi>de plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:35070:35"/>Bread without meal.</hi> For where ever there is quantity, Figure and Local mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: there muſt needs be matter. For Quantity immediately follows the Nature of matter, and cannot be in any thing without it, and all forms and accidents have no quantity of themſelves, but are ſaid to have quantity, becauſe of the Quantity of the matter wherein they are. Wherefore ſince we ſee, that the Heaven hath quantity, is of a certain Figure, and a determinate magnitude, and locally mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: we muſt needs confeſs that it hath matter in it.</p>
                  <p>But what kind of matter this is,
<note place="margin">Whether the matter of the Heavens be the ſame with that of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</note> whether ſuch as this of ours, or ſome peculiar: is ſo obſcure a Queſtion, that reſolve which way you will, you may eaſily find ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to maintain your Aſſertion. We deny that the Heaven conſiſts of one or more of theſe Elements of ours, which was the opinion of very many an cient Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers: yet I conceive we ſhould not aſſign it any other matter, then this firſt matter of ours. For there is no need to invent a new one, nor any neceſſity to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>introduce a new being, into the Catalogue of Nature: ſince what ever is attributed to the Heaven in reſpect of its matter, may rightly be attributed to this matter of ours. <hi>Scaliger</hi> therefore in his <hi>Exercitation,</hi> 61. does well conclude this Queſtion: One matter differs not from another, ſave by the Form entring thereinto, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it becomes this or that. For matter as matter, includes no act in it ſelf, and has nothing determinate, but receives all determination from the Form. Whereunto this may be added, that in Heaven there is Quantity, and ſome other Qualities, which are common to it and theſe inferior Bodies, and proceed from the firſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Which things being ſo the opinion of <hi>Avenroes</hi> cannot be admitted who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented a new ſimple Body not compounded of Matter and Form, and held that Heaven was a Body, that was neither pure matter, nor pure Form, nor any thing of them compounded, but a certain middle thing betwixt theſe, <hi>viz,</hi> A certain form conſiſting of it ſelf, furniſhed with dimenſions and apt for Local motion. For theſe things ſeem to be invented without cauſe, yea and hard to conceive, That there ſhould be a thing (to uſe <hi>Scaligers</hi> words <hi>Exerc.</hi> 61. <hi>S.</hi> 1.) in Nature ſubſiſting of it ſelf, which is neither God, nor an Act, nor a power; neither informing nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; neither matter nor immaterial; neither a Body nor incorporeal; without the Predicaments, and yet having Predicamental Quantity and Qualities. Which what for a thing it can be, let himſelf conſider. And if it could be proved, that there is a ſimple Body not compounded of matter and Form: verily a great foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of peripatetical Phyloſophy will fall to the ground. And if there were ſuch ſimplicity in the Heaven: there can be perhaps no cauſe aſſigned, why it might not alſo be admitted in ſome ſublunary Bodies.</p>
                  <p>Nor if we ſhould attribute to Heaven this firſt matter of ours, need we to fear that the Heaven ſhould fal and at one time or another of its own Nature come to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. For according to <hi>Zabarella</hi> himſelf <hi>Lib. de Ortu &amp; Interitu c.</hi> 11. who nevertheleſs in this point takes part with <hi>Averroes,</hi> the firſt matter, ſeeing it is a being meerly potential, and acts nothing, is no adequate Cauſe of Generation and corruption of things: and every action is to be aſcribed to the Agent; and to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, paſſion only belongs. Nor is matter the ſubject of Corruption, ſave when it is with Natural Forms corruptible, from which the accidents flow, which have contrarily, or contraries alſo under contrary differences. Therefore we muſt not deny the Heavens to have matter, though they be not generated nor corrupted. For there are two offices of matter. Univerſally and primarily it is given <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o all things, to ſuſtain Quantity, and to receive motion, and the actions of Agents. For it is the firſt ſubject of Quantity, and is meerly paſſive, acts nothing, but only ſuffers: and all things naturally ſuffer, becauſe they have matter. Moreover Matter is given to ſublunary things, becauſe of Generation, to which it concurs as a ſecondary cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> In as much as it is apt to receive the Action of the Generator. The cauſe therefore why there is no Generation nor Corruption in the Heavens is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is nothing contrary to Heaven, by which it may be corrupted, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it has no Particular aptitude to receive other forms, which is only oppoſed to act, and is really the ſame thing with privation. For in Heaven there is no Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of corruptiple Forms; becauſe the Heaven hath no immediate aptitude to receive ſublunary Forms, But the Form of Heaven does ſo diſpoſe and bind its matter to i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſelf, that it has no Particular aptitude to receive other Forms, but only that ſame univerſal one, which is an aptitude to receive all Forms indifferently; in reſpect of which nevertheleſs unleſs a Particular aptitude be added, and a contrary
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:35070:35"/>agent be at hand, no Generation is made. Yea and (which I would have thoſe to conſider, who think the Heaven muſt periſh, if it have matter) the Earth which is in the Centre of the world is ſafe from all Corruption nor is corup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, becauſe no contrary Agent pierces ſo far, by which it might be corrupted. We conclude therefore; that <hi>The matter of Heaven has no particular and immediate apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to receive coruptible forms; and that it has only an appetite of perfection, but not of Mutation,</hi> as <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaies. For the Matter becauſe it cannot ſubſiſt of it ſelf, deſires to be perfected by the form, whatever form it be, whether of a Man or of a Beetle, nor of its own accord does it lay down one form and take up another; but the whol viciſſitude of Generation and Corruption, depends upon the Contrariety of the forms and the qualities iſſuing out of them, as on its principal Cauſe: which ſeeing the Heaven has not, we need not to fear, that it ſhal come to decay, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of its matter. Of which ſee more in <hi>Scaligers Exercit.</hi> 17. and 61.</p>
                  <p>Moreover that is alſo no Inconvenience <hi>that there ſhould be one matter of Celeſtial and Sublunary things.</hi> For the difference and excellency of things proceeds not from the matter, but from the form; and the ſame firſt matter which bears the form of a Muſhrome or Flea, is alſo the ſubject of ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Nor is it a leſs Controverſie, <hi>What that form of Heaven is.
<note place="margin">What is the Form of Heaven</note> Averroes</hi> and they which follow him do not allow the Heaven an informing Form, but ſay that it is a ſimple body, without compoſition of matter and form. But this opinion has been already rejected. But we do more rightly to attribute unto Heaven an <hi>informing Form</hi> alſo, ſince as we have ſhewed it conſiſts of matter. For matter cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of it ſelf, not perform thoſe moſt noble actions which proceed from Heaven, beſides its motion; ſince it is purely paſſive, and no action belongs thereunto. Yea and matter of it ſelf, cannot be moved: for <hi>every thing which is moved is an actual Being.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>whether it be formally a ſoul or not,</hi> needs inquiſition.
<note place="margin">Whether the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven has a Soul.</note> It is indeed an old opinion of the Pythagoricks and Platonicks, that the Heaven has a ſoul: howbeit the contrary opinion is truer, which holds that the Heaven has no ſoul. For there appears no actions of any kind of living Creature therein, which can proceed from a ſoul; nor has it any of thoſe Organs, which are neceſſary to perform the actions of a living Creature. The Heaven is not nouriſhed: becauſe in Heaven nothing is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted or diſſolved, which needs to be reſtored by nouriſhment: nor does it feel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it has no organs of feeling, nor of other ſences, nor is there any end for which the Heaven ſhould have ſences: Much leſs can we allow an intelligent ſoul to the Heaven to inform the ſame, leſt we fal into that Error which many have condemned in <hi>Origen,</hi> who taught the Stars had ſouls and were capable of Virtues and Vices. It is ſufficient therefore to attribute to the Heaven a form which is no ſoul; but yet more noble than the forms of the Elements, by means of which, it is that which it is, has a certain figure, and a certain power by means of its Light and Influences of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting upon theſe lower bodies, and alſo motion. And this is the matter and form of Heaven by means of which it is alſo rightly termed a natural Body. For if it were deſtitute of theſe, a juſt cauſe could hardly be found, why it ſhould be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a natural Body.

Touching the Orbs certain weighty queſtions are moved, and in the firſt place we are to enquire: <hi>Whether the Heavens be one continued body, or diſtinguiſhed into divers Orbs or contiguous Spheres.</hi> Now the ancients have endeavored to prove that there are many Heavens, by reaſon of the diverſity of motions, which cannot be in a ſimple body: ſeeing every ſimple body, is moved with one ſimple motion naturally, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> tels us 1. <hi>de Celo ch.</hi> 2. <hi>t.</hi> 7. For when the ancient Aſtronomers and natural Phyloſophers, began to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the motions of the Sun and Moon and other Stars; they obſerved that all the Stars did not obſerve the ſame ſwiftneſs and diſtance, in their motion, but that ſome were moved more ſwiftly, others more ſlowly, ſome never joyned but alwaies keeping the ſame diſtance one from another, and others again coming neerer one to another, even to a conjunction; that the Sun went alwaies in the middle of the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:35070:36"/>Heaven, and that the other Planets declined ſome whiles to the North other whiles to the South. From which variety of motions they gathered; that the Heaven is not one continued Body, but is compounded of divers contiguous Orbs.</p>
                  <p>But moſt of the latter Writers deny, that the various motions of the Stars do rightly prove a plurality of heavenly Orbs; and they aver that this variety of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions does not proceed from the number of the Orbs, but that it belongs primarily to the Stars themſelves. And in very deed it is more likely, <hi>that the Stars are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of themſelves with their own proper motions:</hi> and that the Heaven is a body, not hard, nor diſtinguiſhed into real Orbs, wherein they ſtick faſt and are mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For ſince it is now out of Controverſie (unleſs any wil call in queſtion the moſt certain demonſtrations of Aſtronomers) that Comets or unuſual Stars (for we ſhal not now contend about the name) have been ſeen in the Region of Heaven above the Moon, and have obſerved peculiar motions, not like the motion of any other Star fixed or planetary; this could not be, without the penetration of Bodies if the Heaven did conſiſt of ſolid Orbs: For if the body of the Comet were fixed in the orb of any ſixed or planetary Star, it would alwaies keep the ſame diſtance from the ſaid Star or Planet. Which ſince it does not, a peculiar Orb ſhould be attributed to every Comet, to carry the ſame about: Which cannot be; ſince the whol Cyſtern of Heaven according to the ancient Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, is poſſeſſed by the Orbs of the ſix'd Stars and Planets. Alſo the motion of of the Planets proves the ſame. For ſeeing they are ſomtimes neerer the Earth, ſomtimes further off, which the Doctrine of <hi>Paralaxes</hi> teaches, and the appearing Quantity ſhews; for <hi>Venus</hi> appears ſomtimes ſo great that the unwary beholders take her for a new Star; and <hi>Mars</hi> is ſomtimes ſeen equal to to <hi>Jupiter</hi> in bigneſs: which cannot any otherwiſe come to paſs, ſave becauſe in the fluid and penetrable body of the Heaven, the ſaid Stars come ſomtimes neerer the Earth, and otherwhiles go farther from the ſame. And how could <hi>Mars</hi> be ſomtimes higher, otherwhiles lower than the Sun, if both were carried in a ſolid Orb?</p>
                  <p>The Premiſes therefore conſidered,
<note place="margin">The Stars are moved by a facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty planted in them by God.</note> we muſt hold that in that ſame fluid, penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, moſt thin delicate, and inviſible body of Heaven, <hi>The Stars are moved by a power and faculty implanted in them by God their Creator,</hi> without any violent and external impulſe or carriage.

For though the chief action upon theſe lower bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, proceeds from above from the Stars: yet muſt not all active power be denied the Heaven it ſelf, wherein the Stars are and are moved; ſeeing it alſo has its form, which can no waies be idle. Moreover the Heaven is the <hi>greateſt of all bodies,</hi> ſince it imbraces all other bodies of the world in its Compaſs:
<note place="margin">It is the greateſt of bodies.</note> alſo it has a <hi>Spherical Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,</hi> becauſe it is of all others the moſt capacious.</p>
                  <p>As to the Nature of the Stars, it is indeed commonly held,
<note place="margin">The Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of the Stars.</note> that they are the thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker parts of their Orbs; but the truer opinion is, that the moſt good and great God, did on the fourth day diſtribute that ſame primitive light, which he made the firſt day, into the Stars, and hence was the original of all this number of Stars. For it is abſurd to think that firſt light returned to nothing, ſeeing it was good. Or if any man pleaſe to place that primitive light in the upmoſt region of the world, above the ſtarry Heaven, and to make that upmoſt Region its manſion place; yet it muſt be confeſſed, that God the Author of the world, created the Stars them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ful of light upon the fourth day; whereas he created the Heaven before, upon the ſecond day. And this light is, doubtleſs, a moſt noble ſubſtance, moſt excellent, moſt ſimple, than which among all bodies, nothing is more beautiful, more ſweet, nothing more admirable: by which all theſe ſublunary things are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined and cheriſhed: without which this world would have no beauty: this as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong bodies it is moſt beautiful, ſo it is the firſt and chiefeſt Image of the wiſdom, beauty, power and goodneſs of the moſt high.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit, the inmoſt nature and Eſſence of this Light, is unapproachable and unſearchable by humane wit; and therefore we cannot in this darkneſs of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane underſtanding perfectly underſtand the nature of the Stars. For ſeeing the Eſſences even of thoſe things which are about us in this lower world, are unknown to us; 'tis eaſie to ſee how little we can promiſe our ſelves concerning the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of things ſo exceedingly remote.</p>
                  <p>Very like it is, That <hi>every Star has its proper ſubſtantial ſorm,</hi> and as here below, Plants and Animals do by their forms differ from the Air wherein they live, and one from a nother, ſo alſo that the Stars differ both from the Heaven and one from another, by their ſpecifick forms, which appears even from their eſſential proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Effects. For the Stars have light, the Heaven has not, and the Stars do ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by differ one from another; and Experience ſhews, that theſe things below are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently affected by different parts.</p>
                  <p>Since therfore we cannot pierce into the knowledg of the inner form and Eſſence of the Stars, let us weigh and conſider theſe proprieties and effects which flow from the form and Eſſence of the Stars. And there comes here chiefly to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, Their Motion, Light and Shine, Heat and hidden Influences.</p>
                  <p>And in the firſt place the moſt wiſe and powerful Creator,
<note place="margin">The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Stars.</note> has placed this power in the Stars, that every one is moved with a certain motion; and he that comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to deſcribe the times by their motion, gave them a power to move and to perform what he had commanded.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe Stars have a double motion.
<note place="margin">Some ſtars are fix'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets.</note> For ſome are moved with an equal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in ſuch ſort, as they retain alwaies the ſame diſtance one from another, and theſe are commonly cal'd the fix'd Stars: others have divers motions, nor are they alwaies equally diſtant one from another, but now are joyned, and after a while ſeparated, one while they are neerer another while further one from another; and thoſe Stars are called Planets.</p>
                  <p>Which being ſo, they make two motions of the Stars,
<note place="margin">Whether there are two moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Stars?</note> one whereby the fixed Stars are perpetually moved altogether, retaining the ſame diſtance one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: the other is both differment for the motion of the fixt Stars, and thereby eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Planet is moved after a peculiar manner. Theſe motions are vulgarly termed the firſt and ſecond motion, and they teach that the firſt motion, is that whereby the uppermoſt Sphere is carried about once in twenty four hours, and carries all the other Spheres with it from Eaſt to Weſt; and the ſecond they ſay is that which is proper to the reſt of the Spheres, whereby they move contrary to the <hi>Primum mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile</hi> or firſt Sphere from Weſt to Eaſt, ſome more ſwiftly, others more ſlowly:
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:35070:37"/>which diſtinction of motion we willingly allow the Aſtonomers, if they wil take it as an Hypotheſis or ſuppoſition. Howbeit we conceive this diſtinction needleſly introduced into the Schools of Natural Phyloſophy, and peradventure againſt the the Conſent of Nature: and we think it no abſurdity to ſay that all the Stars are moved from Eaſt to Weſt, the ſixed ones moſt ſwiftly, in the ſpace of twenty four hours the reſt by how much they are lower, ſo much the ſlower, and the Moon moſt ſlowly, much about the ſpace of twenty five hours, only ſome minuts leſs.</p>
                  <p>For that ſeems not a ſufficient Cauſe which they aſſign for their ſecond motion, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe we ſee the Moon or ſome other planet, which was joyned to ſome fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Star, in the Weſt or the South, after one or two daies, one or more degrees Eaſtward, that Star being left Weſtward, with which it was before conjoyned, it becomes nearer and therefore was moved from the Weſt toward the Eaſt. For if you ſhall ſuppoſe all the Stars to move from Eaſt to Weſt, and every upper Star to be ſwifter then the lower, there wil be the ſame appearance in the Heaven, and the lower which move more ſlowly will be left behind by the upper which are moved ſwiftly: which is more likely to be true then that the planets move towards the Eaſt. Let the Sun and Moon be joyned in one point Weſtward and let us ſuppoſe that the Sun once in twenty four hours and four minuts, and the Moon in twenty four hours, are carryed about the Heavens; when the day following, the Sun ſhal be returned to the ſame point, the Moon wil be yet diſtant therefore almoſt twelve degrees, and will at laſt reach it after fifty one minuts are paſt. And this opinion which we propoſe <hi>Plato</hi> ſeems to have favoured in his 7. <hi>de Legibus,</hi> where thus he writes concering the Sun, Moon, and other Stars. <hi>Every one of them goes round the ſame way, not many waies but one way: though they ſeem to be carried about by various and manifold waies. And that amongſt them which is moſt ſwift, is not rightly judged to be moſt ſlow, and that which is moſt ſlow, moſt ſwift.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Howbeit as to the period of the Stars, and their return (as they cal it) to the ſame point of Heaven; it comes all to one paſs, whether you hold the Stars to be moved with one motion or with two. For the Moon being departed from one point of Heaven, after twenty nine daies or near upon, ſhe is ſeen in the ſame again, which ſpace is called <hi>Menſis Lunaris,</hi> the Moones month. The <hi>Sun, Venus,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> return to the ſame place in the ſpace of about a year: <hi>Mars</hi> in two years; <hi>Jupiter</hi> within twelve years; <hi>Saturn</hi> in the ſpace of thirty years; the fixed Stars in the ſpace of 48000 years, which ſpace of time they call <hi>Plato</hi> his great year: and <hi>Plato</hi> is ſaid to have beleeved that when ſo many years are paſt, al things in the world ſhal return unto their old State.</p>
                  <p>In the next place we are to conſider in the Stars their <hi>Lux</hi> and <hi>Lumen,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lux, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> and <hi>Radius, how they differ.</hi>
                     </note> Light and Shine, then which the whol world hath nothing more pleaſant, and which are rightly called by <hi>Franciſcus Patricius</hi> in the <hi>fourth Book of his Panaugia,</hi> the good and great God his greateſt and beſt Inſtrument. And firſt let us ſee what <hi>Lux, Lumen,</hi> and <hi>Radius</hi> are, and how they differ one from another. Some there have been and ſtill are in that opinion, that Light is a ſubſtance and the Form of the Celeſtial Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; but their opinion ſwerves from the truth; ſince no ſubſtantial Form can be diſcerned by the ſight. We muſt therefore hold, that <hi>Lux</hi> light is a quality and Eſſential propriety of a lightful body, of it ſelf perceptible by the ſight. But what is the firſt ſubject of light, or, whether all the Stars ſhine with their own light,
<note place="margin">The Stars ſhine both with their own and borrwed light.</note> or borrow it from the Sun, herein the opinions of Phyloſophers do vary. For ſome hold all the Stars ſhine with their own proper light, others hold they al bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row their light from the Sun, and others again hold that only the Moon borrows her light of him. This is our opinion: That all the Stars do indeed receive ſome light from the Sun: yet that they have alſo ſome light of their own. Both which we are taught by experience. For firſt we may cheifly obſerve, it in the Moon, which in regard of her ſeveral poſture to the Sunward, hath various Appearances, in regard of the Variety of light which ſhe receives from the Sun: the ſame is to be ſeen in the reſt of the Planets, which are obſerved to be brighter or darker in regard of their ſeveral poſtures to the Sun. And therefore <hi>Orpheus</hi> calls the Sun the quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening Eye of Heaven: <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> the Fountain of Heavenly light; the ancient Phyloſophers, the Heart of Heaven; and the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> placed the Soul of the world in the Sun, as <hi>Marſilius Ficinus</hi> tels us in <hi>his Book de Sole Ch.</hi> 6. The latter may be obſerved not only in the Moon, but alſo in the other planets. For in the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:35070:37"/>Ecclipſe of the Moon, we ſee ſhe has ſome light, and the ſame appears alſo after her conjunction, when we may many times ſee that part of her which is from the Sun, by means of her inbred light: which alſo any one may obſerve in the planets which are lower then the Sun, as <hi>Franciſcus Patritius</hi> teaches, in the 7. <hi>Book of his Panaugia</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the light proceed <hi>Lumen</hi> and <hi>Rady,</hi> ſhine and Beams, which <hi>Franc. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritius</hi> ſaies are two divers things in the 3. <hi>B. of his Panaugia.</hi> The truth is, where there are Beams there is ſhine, but there may be ſhine where there are no beams or raies. For in a Chamber which looks towards the North, and is not right againſt the Sun, there is a ſhine at noon tide, but no beam or Raies.
<note place="margin">What <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> Beam or Ray is.</note> And therefore a Ray or Beam as he there ſhews, is as it were a ſecondary Light, or a brightneſs ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the firſt light, and ſhooting to a right and an acuate Angle. And <hi>Lumen</hi> or ſhine, is as it were a third light, flowing from the firſt and ſecond not diffuſed into Lines and Pyramids, but looſely ſhed abroad. Firſt therefore there is <hi>Lux</hi> light in the lucid Body; then there is <hi>Radius</hi> a Beam which is an image of the light, diffuſed from the lucid body in a right Line; thirdly <hi>Lumen</hi> or ſhine, which diffuſes it ſelf obliquely, aſide the falling of the raies into all parts of the <hi>Medium.</hi> And indeed there ſeems to be ſome difference between a Ray and ſhine, or at leaſt it is one thing to repreſent the light as a viſible object and to offer it to the ſight, and another thing to Illuminate the Air. For light ſeen from a dark place, does not enlighten all the air, betwixt the eye and the lucid thing; and that light which enlightens the Air hardly a furlong, is ſeen ſome miles of, in the night time; yea and the Stars themſelves, are ſeen by us at an huge diſtance in the night; though they do not illuminate the whol Air. Which difference cauſes, that there is a twofold definition of <hi>Lumen</hi> or ſhine. For abſolutely conſidered, ſhine is the image of light, or the quality of a Lucid Body, whereby it communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates it ſelf to other Natural things, affording it ſelf to their ſight, and cheriſhing them. But as <hi>Shine</hi> is conſidered in reſpect of other things which it inlightens, it is the act of Colours whereby they become viſible.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning <hi>Lumen</hi> or ſhine ſome Controverſies are agitated.
<note place="margin">Whether light is a Subſtance or Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent?</note> And firſt tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Nature thereof there hath alwaies been great diſſenſions amongſt Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, which are not yet compoſed, ſo that it is dangerous to determine any thing in this point. Howbeit I ſhall breiſly deliver, what ſeems probable in ſo obſcure a matter. Now the queſtion is whether it be a ſubſtance or an accident. For there are very many who hold that it is a ſubſtance, ſome corporeal, others into poreal. And they that ſay the Raies and ſhine are a ſubſtance, are chiefly moved thereunto, becauſe the ſhine and Beams are diffuſed through the Heaven and the Air, and that in a moment; which ſeems improper for an accident, which paſſes not out of one ſubject into another and becauſe falling upon adark and ſolid body they are reflected and leap back again. And thoſe arguments could almoſt move me unleſs the ſame arguments, did make as much againſt all viſible, yea, and ſenſible ſpecies or repreſentations. For, neither are other viſible ſpecies moved with the motion of the Air, and they are in a moment diffuſed through their whol Sphere: Yea, and ſome alſo, witneſs the Eccho, is reflected And therefore as oft as I think of this matter, I thus complain of the obſcurity of Nature with that moſt learned Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher and Phyſitian <hi>Hieronymus Fracaſtorius.</hi>

<note place="margin">Lumen, <hi>light, or ſhine is an accident not a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal.</hi>
                     </note> that opinion ſeems to be trueſt, which does affirm that light is neither a Body nor a ſubſtance incorporeal, but an accident, and quality produced by a lucid Body in a tranſparent Medium whoſe act it is. For if the light were a body, ſince it is diffuſed through the whol Air, and is received by all the parts of the Air, there would be a penetration of Bodies. Moreover, if it were a Body, it ſhould be moved ſucceſſivly in time. For a Body cannot be moved in an inſtant through a Medium filled with another Body: becauſe the middle Body through which it is moved would reſiſt the ſame in its motion. But we ſee the light ſpred far and near in a moment. And that it is no incorporeal and ſpiritual ſubſtance is hereby apparent: in that ſpiritual ſubſtances fall not under our ſenſes, or have dimenſions; both which are true of Raies and Light.</p>
                  <p>That light therefore is no ſubſtance but <hi>a Quality,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Whether light be a real or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentional accident.</note> hath been made appear. But whether it be a <hi>real</hi> or <hi>Intentional</hi> accident as they Phraſe it, is a great queſtion amongſt the expoſitors of <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> And in the firſt place we muſt rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſenſe of this queſtion. An intention and an intentional being, though it is commonly taken only for that which depends upon the operation of our mind, and without it, is nothing, <hi>viz.</hi> For an intelligible ſpecies which repreſents ſomwhat without the Soul to our underſtanding, either immediately, ſuch as are the firſt notions, or mediately by the mediation of the firſt, ſuch as are the ſecond notions: yet here in a more general ſenſe, the word Intention, ſignifies that which is the Image and repreſentation of another thing without the Mind, that is to ſay the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of a ſenſible ſubject in the Medium; and ſo an intentional being is taken for every ſpiritual ſpecies repreſenting a real object, whether it be ſenſible of intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual. So the Collor which is in our Cloaths or on a tree, is called real; that which is in a Looking-Glaſs, and is the Image of the color in the Cloaths, and that which from the tree is ſhed upon the Cloaths of him that lies under it, is ſaid to be an intentional color. And in this ſenſe we hold, that the ſhine, is an intentional quality: yet that nevertheleſs, it is a real being, as having its own Eſſence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the operation of our mind, yea, and that it hath a more noble office then other intentional ſpecies ſo called, and that it is ordained out only for repreſentation, but alſo for other effectual operations. Others do thus explain the matter. That light is a ſpiritual quality, not principal or real, or rather material. Now there is a great difference betwixt principal or material, and ſpiritual Qualities. For the former are not the image of another thing; they are received in the ſubject ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively, and are moved in time according to the motion thereof; they are not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally in any part of the ſubject; they are not many of the ſame ſort in the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, differing only in number, and kept unconfuſed and diſtinct. Whereas the contrary holes in ſpiritual Qualities; as we may ſee in <hi>Lumen</hi> or ſhine. For ſhine is the Image of Light; 'tis ſhed through the whol Air in a moment; it is not moved according to the motion of the ſubject. For though the Air is toſſed with winds yet the ſhine of light is not moved thereby. Every part of the ſhine repreſents the whol lucid Body from whence it comes, and in the ſame part of the Air, many images of lucid Bodies or lights are kept diſtinct and inconfuſed.</p>
                  <p>A Ray or beam is divided into a right, a reflex, a fract, and a refract: and that is termed right or ſtreight,
<note place="margin">The divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a Ray or Beam.</note> which paſſes from the lucid Body, without any hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance of a dark Body. That is reflex, which lighting upon a thick dark Body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds back. That is fract, which paſſes out of a thin into a groſs Medium, as that which comes out of the Air into the Water. That is refract, which comes out of a thick Medium into a thin. Howbeit <hi>Scaliger</hi> oppoſes the terms of a reflex and fract <hi>Radius</hi> in his <hi>Exercit.</hi> 75. <hi>Sect.</hi> 10. and conceives, not without cauſe, that that which is commonly called reflex, ſhould rather be termed fract: for the reflex commonly ſo called, is not one Beam but two; one falling on and another reboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding back: and that the fract, ought rather to be termed ſhed, or powred abroad. For that is one Ray, which is in the Water and in the Air; diſſering only in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety,

                  <p>After <hi>Lux</hi> and <hi>Lumen,</hi> Light and Shine, the Heavenly heat comes to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and the canſes thereof to be ſearched into. And although, not only ſome of the ancients, but of the latter writers alſo, have been of opinion, that the Heavens and Stars do therefore heat, becauſe they are of a fiery Nature, and have in them
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:35070:38"/>Heat formally, as a Natural accident, by means whereof they again heat other things: yet that opinion is by moſt men rejected, and it is reſolved, that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven though it is not of its own Nature hot, hath yet a power of heating theſe inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Bodies; and as <hi>Scaliger</hi> conceives in his 23. <hi>Exercitat.</hi> that the heat is indeed from the Stars, but not in them, but in theſe bodies beneath; and in the 74 <hi>Exercit. Sect.</hi> 2. that calefaction or heating does primarily and of it ſelf belong to the Sun, without any Medium, as to a firſt Body, the author of Heat, but not the firſt ſubject thereof. But if any man ſhall hold, that the Stars are hot, not with a fiery heat, but with an heat proper to themſelves, I ſee not by what ſolid reaſon, he can be confuted. For there is no cauſe why the Heaven ſhould be void of all qualities. And Heat ſeems to be an individual conpanion to light. Nor need any man fear, that the Heaven ſhould be corrupted by theſe inferior Bodies, if it be hot. For ſince the Heaven does not participate with theſe inferior bodies, either in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of its Eſſence, or its Qualities: the inferior bodies no waies act upon the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial. Nor was <hi>Carden</hi> the firſt that held heat to be in the Heaven, but the <hi>Arabian</hi> Phyloſophers long before, and <hi>Mirandulanus</hi> and others who followed them. For thus writes <hi>Job. Picus Mirandulanus</hi> in <hi>Aſtrolog. Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Ch.</hi> 4. Heat follows light as a propriety thereof, not fiery heat, nor Aereal but Celeſtial; a proper quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Heaven, as light is. I ſay an heat moſt effectual and ſaving, peircing al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>things, cheriſhing all things, moderating all things.</p>
                  <p>From the Premiſes ſome light ariſes to that Queſtion,
<note place="margin">How Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven heats theſe lower Bodies.</note> how Heaven heats theſe lower Bodies? 'Tis commonly held that Heaven heats them, by its motion and light. But touching motion, 'tis a doubtful caſe. It cannot indeed be denied, that a ſwift motion of a ſolid Body, does heat the Air next unto it: ſince experience ſhews that to be true. For motion does heat by attenuating, it makes the parts of the Air thin, and ſo heats them; yea and if it be more vehement, turns them into fire. For the fire being, as hotter, ſo thinner, then the Air. If the Air be a little more atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated, the Form of the Air can no longer ſubſiſt in a thin matter, but the form of Fire is introduced. But this is doubted, whether the Heavens motion, produce heat in theſe lower Bodies?
<note place="margin">VVhether the motion of Heaven be a cauſe of Heat?</note> ſome holds the motion of the Heaven pierces as far as the Earth, yea and into the inmoſt bowels thereof, and produces heat by making the Air thin, and by grating thereupon. But contrariwiſe, <hi>Scaliger</hi> in his 23. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercit.</hi> ſaies, that he did not beleeve the Son of <hi>Roes,</hi> who ſaid, that the Heavenly Bodies did not warm by any heat in themſelves, but that through the ſwiftneſs of motion, both heat and light came from the Stars, by their motion grating upon the Air; and held that the cauſe of the motion of Heaven was, that the Stars might communicate their virtues to the parts here below, but not that they ſhould heat. And indeed great cauſe there is to doubt, whether the Heavens motion do heat the inferior Bodies. For they who hold that the Heaven by its motion, warms theſe inferior Bodies, do all preſuppoſe, that the Heaven is a ſolid Body, by the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvolution whereof, the neighbouring Elements are wheeled about. But that this is falſe, hath been already declared.
<note place="margin">The fire has not its eſſential heat from Heaven.</note> Nor can the bodies of the Stars perform that with their motion, nor does their motion reach to theſe lower bodies, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their ſo great diſtance. Nor does that fire which is next the Moon, receive heat from their motion. For it hath the higheſt degree of heat before, by its own Form. For if it were not in the higheſt degree hot, it were not ſire. And therefore the fire hath not its eſſential heat from the Heavens, but an accidental heat, as the moſt ſubtile <hi>Scaliger,</hi> in his 23. <hi>Exercitation,</hi> ſaies ſubtilly, Yea, and obſcurely enough. For what heat can be added to that which is hot in the higheſt degree? But peradventure, that is thus to be underſtood. That the fire receives not eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial heat from the motion of the Heavens, but hath it from its own form; but it is nevertheleſs preſerved by Heavens motion.</p>
                  <p>Now it is commonly held a clear caſe, that the ſhine is the Cauſe of heat:
<note place="margin">The ſhine is not the Cauſe of heat, but the beams.</note> though that of <hi>Scaliger</hi> in his 75. <hi>Exercitation,</hi> may give occaſion of doubting. <hi>Heat</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>is an accident bred by the Heavenly Bodies, and through the Heaven, without any affection thereof, brought to the Aire, and that not by the ſhine, but both with and without the ſhine.</hi> And indeed the Raies or Beams, rather then the ſhine, are the cauſe of Heat.</p>
                  <p>For there is not Heat, where ever there is ſhine, and in Winter, the Cauſe of the cold is not want of light; ſeeing in the middeſt of Winter, there are many times
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:35070:39"/>as clear and bright daies as in Summer, but it is the obliques of the Suns beams. And therefore when <hi>Lumen</hi> or ſhine, is ſaid to be the cauſe of heat; the Beams or raies are to be underſtood.</p>
                  <p>But how the Raies or Light does heat,
<note place="margin">How the Raies or Beams do heat?</note> Doctors are not yet agreed. Some are of the opinion that light therefore heats, becauſe it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For though the incident and ſingle Raies, have alſo the power of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and attenuating: yet their force, they ſay, is weak; but the doubled Raies beating one againſt another do more ſtrongly grate upon he Air and rariſie the ſame. Howbeit many do contrary wiſe hold with probability enough, that the light does of its own Nature produce heat, and that a Ray compounded of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> one and a reflex, does heat more then a ſimple, not becauſe two Raies Imiting one againſt another do grate upon the Air (for how ſhould that great upon the Air which is no Body?) but becauſe, that portion of light which was to go ſtreight forward, being hindred by an Opake Body is reflected and joyned with the incident Ray, and ſo virture conjoyned becomes ſtronger then that which is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed. Hence ſome Raies are ſtronger then other ſome to excite Heat. For thoſe which fal perpendicularly, and reflect upon themſelves, are of al others moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual:
<note place="margin">Perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer raies moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual.</note> and thoſe are next theſe moſt powerful who go leaſt into oblick Augles; but the more they go oblickly from the point of incidence, the leaſt heat they raiſe. For the nearer the Sun comes to our Zenith and the directer his beams <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>al upon us; ſo much the greater heat is cauſed. And it goes contrariwiſe in the Winter, when the Sun darts his Beams upon us oblickly.</p>
                  <p>Now it will be worth our while to enquire whether the Heavens do not alſo ſome other waies work upon theſe inferior Bodies.

For nothing in the whol Univerſe is idle, nothing made in vain, but all things as they have their Forms; ſo by them they operate and act. Experience not to be contradicted does witneſs the ſame. For we ſee and feel, how that by the Heavenly Bodies, through the various augmentation of heat, the changes of times and ſeaſons, and the viciſſitude of generation and corruption are cauſed; tempeſts are raiſed; the humors of Animals, eſpecially ſhelſiſh do encreaſe and leſſen according as the Moon Fils or Wains.

Yet we muſt hold the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Heaven, not only by its motion and light and the heat thereon depending, but alſo by certain peculiar powers, which they call influences, does act upon theſe lower-Bodies. For many effects proceed from Heaven, which cannot be aſcribed to light. For light may be kept out, by a dark or denſe Body; whereas many things are generated by the concurrency of Heaven in the profoundeſt Cavities of the Earth, under the Waters, whether neither the light of Heaven nor the heat produced thereby can pierce.

                  <p>Howbeit we muſt enquire how far this Influx of the Heavens extends it ſelf, and upon what things it works. It is not to be denyed, that <hi>the Heaven acts upon all material and merely Natural things:</hi> but it is a queſtion, <hi>whether that Celeſtial Influx,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:35070:39"/>do work upon our Soul and will.</hi> All ſound Phyloſophers do anſwer <hi>that the Stars do not work directly and immediately upon our wils.</hi> For ſince the Heaven is a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal and material Agent, it acts only upon corporeal and material things, but our will is a power not allied to matter. Mediately nevertheleſs and indirectly, <hi>viz.</hi> by Mediation of the Organs of our Body, which being variouſly Qualified do move and provoke the Fancy and the ſenſible appetite, and thereby the will; the ſtars may encline our wil to this or that. Upon which ground 'tis alſo commonly ſaid, that Mens manners follow the temperament of their Bodies. Howbeit, neither the temperament, nor the ſtars by the temperament do compel but only encline. For though any one through aboundance of Choler in his Body, be enclined to anger, and through flegm to idleneſs: yet it remaines in the liberty of his will, either to reſrain or give the reines to his anger; or to give himſelf to labor or to take his eaſe. Hence we may eaſily know what to think of Aſtrology,
<note place="margin">What is to be thought of Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions?</note> which is ſaid to foretel fu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

It is not to be denied, that Aſtrologers may many times probably foretel Tempeſts, Rains, Barrenneſs and fruitfulneſs of the Earth, Diſeaſes, and other ſuch like Natural effects, which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally depend upon the diſpoſition of the ſublunary matter in reſpect of heat cold, Moiſture, Drineſs, and other ſuch like qualities, and may betide ſublunary Bodies. Yet Experience ſhews that they cannot alwaies certainly foretel ſuch things as theſe.</p>
                  <p>For ſeeing there is requiſite to theſe kind of effects, not only the influx of the Heavenly Bodies, which is the univerſal Cauſe, but alſo a certain diſpoſition of the Earthly Globe, which affords matter to Rain and other Meteors, and alſo of the Matter and ſublunary qualities, which are all unſtable and ſubject to change, and cannot be ſufficiently diſcerned by the wit of man: the judgment and progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtication cannot alwaies be firm and certain. Much leſs can any thing be certainly foretold concerning human actions which depend upon the wills of Men, and tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching things contingent and fortuitous. For though theſe things depend in ſome meaſure, as hath been ſaid, upon the temperament: yet becauſe our temperament does not compel our wil, and the Heaven it ſelf is not the immediate and principal Cauſe of the temperament, it is alſo hard in this Caſe to foretel any thing with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</p>
                  <p>Nor dare the ſounder Aſtrologers themſelves attribute any greater efficacy to the Stars, nor to themſelves any greater ability of Prediction. Whence alſo <hi>Ptolomy</hi> himſelf, <hi>de Pred. Aſtronom. Lib.</hi> 7. teaches that thoſe things only can be foretold, in the Calculation of Nativities, which depend upon the temperature, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Body of ſuch an one is ſo and ſo, and his manners ſo and ſo, whence ſuch and ſuch events will follow, becauſe the quality of the Heaven ſuitable to the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament, is fit to produce a good habit, or contrary thereunto. And he himſelf ſaies in terms expreſs, that thoſe who forerel other things, which have not Natural Cauſes, are couſening fellows, that abuſe the people. <hi>Ptolomy</hi> therefore the Prince of Aſtrologinians hath ſet th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And the ſame Author alſo teaches in <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. That many things beſides the Heaven, do concur to the Temperaments of Particular perſons, and that the ſeed falling from the Bodies of their parents, hath the chiefeſt force, alſo that the Countrey makes a difference, and that education and Cuſtom have no ſmal force to change the temperament.</p>
                  <p>The Cauſes of many Sympathies and Antipathies doubtleſs, betwixt the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Bodies and theſe things below, do proceed from theſe hidden influences, the Inquiſition whereof does belong unto another place.

                  <p>The Planets are commonly reckoned to be but ſeven.
<note place="margin">The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Planets.</note> For though <hi>Favorinus</hi> in in <hi>Gellius B.</hi> 14. <hi>ch.</hi> 1. did doubt whether there were only ſeven Planets; and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed there might be more, though not ſeen by us, in regard of their exceeding ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſplendor or altitude: yet becauſe neither experience, nor reaſon can evince there are more, the vulgar number has been retained hitherto.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit amongſt the late Aſtronomers <hi>Galilaeus</hi> a Florentine, has found out cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain new Planets, formerly not known or ſeen by any man, by help of his optical Tube or proſpective Glaſs; which he obſerved to move about <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and cal'd them the medicean Stars (from <hi>Coſmos medices</hi> the Duke of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, to whom he dedicated his labors) alſo the Jovial Stars or <hi>Jupiter's</hi> Stars: whoſe number and motion he deſcribed in a Book called <hi>Siderius Nuncius:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he deſcribed other things by him obſerved in the face of the Moon, in innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fixed Stars, the Galaxy or Milky way, and cloudy Stars, worthy of conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>

                  <p>Alſo there is ſome controverſie touching the order of the Planets:

For both the obſervation of the Paralla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes, and other Aſtronomical reaſons do confirm the ſame.</p>
                  <p>For the greater Parallaxe a Planet has, the neerer it is to the Earth; and the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer parallaxe, the further from the Earth. But amongſt all the Planets, the Moon has the greateſt Parallaxe; <hi>Mercury</hi> ſomwhat a leſſer; <hi>Venus</hi> yet a leſſer; and the Sun the leaſt. Whence we collect, that the Moon is neereſt the Earth, <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> a little further off than ſhe, <hi>Venus</hi> more remote than he, and the Sun more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote than <hi>Venus.</hi> Moreover the Moon obſcures and takes out of our ſight <hi>Mercury, Venus</hi> and the <hi>Sun;</hi> which could not be, if theſe Planets were lower.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, although this be certain, and the reaſons aforeſaid do ſufficiently demonſtrate, that the <hi>Moon</hi> is below <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Venus:</hi> yet it is not thereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that <hi>Venus</hi> is higher than <hi>Mercury.</hi> For ſuppoſe the <hi>Moon</hi> obſcure <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury:</hi> yet it does not hence appear, whether <hi>Mercury</hi> or <hi>Venus</hi> be next the <hi>Moon,</hi> or whether <hi>Mercury</hi> be below or above <hi>Venus.</hi> Nor do the Parallaxes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the ſame.

But whatever Scituation of the Planets we ſhal allow, yet this remains certain, that it cannot be defended, unleſs we hold, as has been ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed before, that the Heaven is no ſolid body, and that there are indeed no Orbs therein of which it ſhould conſiſt.

                  <p>Nevertheleſs divers moſt noble Phyloſophers and Aſtronomers, have rejected this opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> for theſe reaſons chiefly. Firſt the perpetuity of the <hi>Via<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lactea:</hi> for ſeeing all meteors are ſomwhat diſorderly made, nor is there alwaies matter enough, of the ſame figure, or color for meteors, nor is it alwaies carried to the ſame part of Heaven: the <hi>Galaxie</hi> or milky way, if it were a meteor would not be alwaies, nor of the ſame magnitude, figure, color; nor alwaies in the ſame place. Again if the <hi>Vialactea</hi> were not in the Heaven but in the Air, it would not be alwaies ſeen in the ſame place of Heaven, and about the ſame Stars, and would admit ſome parallaxe; after the ſame manner as Comets, which are in the Air, in this Region appear under one Star, in another Region under another. Howbeit, experience teaches the contrary, which witneſſeth, that for ſo many ages of years the milky way has alwaies been ſeen, when the Sky is clear, in the ſame place, of the ſame greatneſs, ſhape and color, and in all places, about the ſame Stars.</p>
                  <p>Nor has the opinion of <hi>Franciſcus Picolhomineus</hi> any place, who that he might ſome waies defend the vulgar opinion, ſaies that there is a twofold <hi>Galaxie</hi> or mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky way; the one Celeleſtial, which is an ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For though it be true that a greater company of Stars, wil more heat and raiſe up more vapors: yet no ſufficient cauſe, can hence be aſſigned, why the <hi>Galaxie</hi> or <hi>Vialactea,</hi> ſhould appear alwaies of the ſame Greatneſs, and Figure, and in the ſame place. For to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:35070:41"/>the conſtitution of a meteor, there is not only required, the force of one or more Stars, but alſo matter, and that after a certain manner diſpoſed: which becauſe it is fluent and unſtable, and is wonderfully changed by reaſon of the Influx of ſo many Stars, no meteor can be perpetual, conſtant, and alwaies return in the ſame meaſure and manner: nor does the <hi>Sun</hi> nor any other Star, yea though in the ſame poſition, or returning to the ſame place, raiſe the ſame tempeſts, nor can they cauſe the breeding of the ſame meteors, by reaſon of the plenty or penury, or the various diſpoſition of the exhalation.</p>
                  <p>That opinion therefore of others is more probable, that teach, the <hi>Vialactea</hi> to be a collection of very many and very ſmal Stars, which they cal <hi>Sporadas,</hi> in the eighth Sphere, which becauſe of their ſmalneſs and abundance, cannot be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly ſeen, ſo that their light being jumbled together, repreſents to our ſight a white, or milky color. To this opinion others do alſo add: that this part of the Heaven is a little more compact than the reſt, and by reaſon of its compactneſs comes neet to the nature of Stars, and therefore both by its own light, and by that which it receives from the other Stars, it appears more bright than the other parts of Heaven which are more thin and tranſparent, and is of a remarkable white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>Next to the Stars we ranck Comets;
<note place="margin">Divers O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of the Nature of Comets.</note> and truly there is an extream diverſity of opinions touching their Nature. <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> and <hi>Democritus</hi> held that a Comet was the gathering together of divers Planets, which becauſe they were met in one place, by the mingling of their lights they ſeemed to make one Star. The <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goreans</hi> taught that a Comet was a Planet diſtinct from the ſeven vulgar Planets, which commonly lies hid under the Sun-beams, and by reaſon of the ſplendor of the neighboring Sun cannot be ſeen: howbeit ſometimes, after long Intervals, it departs from the Sun and comes into ſight, which alſo commonly happens to <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury. Hippocrates Chius</hi> and his Diſciple <hi>Aeſchylus,</hi> did conſent with the Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans, that a Comet is a Star: yet herein they diſſented, in that the former held the tail of the Comet to be a part thereof; but theſe latter held the tail to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors lifted up on high, and neer the Comet, receiving the raies and light of the Sun, and ſo repreſenting a ſtream of Hair. Howbeit <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> reckons up and refutes theſe opinions in his 1 <hi>Meteor. Cap.</hi> 6. <hi>Seneca</hi> in the 7. <hi>Queſt. Nat. Cap.</hi> 11, 12. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Opinion of <hi>Epigenes,</hi> which <hi>Seneca</hi> relates and refutes in his 7 <hi>Book of Nat. Queſt. ch.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was, that Comets did ariſe, when moiſt and dry exhalations being ſhut up in one Globe, by reaſon of the internal Spirit and the diſcord of contrary bodies, were agitated and whirled about. For then that ſame force of the Wind going round about, did by its motion inflame whatſoever it caught, and lift it on high, and that the ſhining of the Fire and the Comet did ſo long laſt til there was no more fewel to ſeed it, which fewel ceaſing the Comet ceaſes. The Opinion of <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> though it differ in part, does moſtly agree with this. For <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> teaches, that a Comet does not conſiſt of Celeſtial but of elementary matter, namely of pleaty of far &amp; thick exhalations raiſed into the upper Region of the Air and there ſet on fire. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his third <hi>de placit. Phyloſoph. ch.</hi> 2. beſides the opinions of the Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans, <hi>Anaxagoras, Democritus, Ariſtotle, Epigenes,</hi> relates alſo the opinion of <hi>Strato,</hi> conceiving that a Comet was the light of a Star, comprehended in a thick Cloud, as it happens in Candles: and of <hi>Heraclides Ponticus,</hi> who ſaid that a Comet was a Cloud on high enlightened with light from above. <hi>Seneca</hi> in <hi>Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Nat. Queſt. Cap.</hi> 22. conceives that a Comet is no ſuddain Fire, but reckons it among the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal works of nature. <hi>viz.</hi> the Stars. For he conceived there were more Planets than Fire, beſides the Sun and Moon, but that the beginnings and endings of their motions were not yet known; ſeeing they finiſh their courſes at vaſt diſtances of time.</p>
                  <p>Late Writers do alſo differ in this point. <hi>Scaliger</hi> herein conſents with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in thinking that a Comet is made of Elementary matter: but he denies that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed. For in his 79 <hi>Exercitation</hi> thus he writes: <hi>I conceive therefore that a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met is a Vapor drawn by the force of ſome Star into the upper Region of the Air; the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of which vapor is not burning, but of a mixt matter, like a fume or ſteam, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Sun-beams, and therefore viſible, and letting them through, and by that means railed. Cardan</hi> whom <hi>Scaliger</hi> there refutes, had ſaid, That a Comet is a Globe in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:35070:42"/>the Heaven inlightened by the Sun, through which the Beams being tranſmitted, do make as it were a tail. Becauſe the Heaven is ful of Stars, which are not very compact, but when the Air grows dry, or for ſome other cauſes, they receive and retain light.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bodinus</hi> in his Theatre of Nature <hi>Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>P.</hi> 217. thinks it better ingeniouſly to confeſs his ignorance, than raſhly to affirm any thing in this Point, or to aſſent to moſt light opinions. Yet he in <hi>P.</hi> 221. <hi>of the ſaid Book,</hi> ſeems to be almoſt of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that Comets are the minds of illuſtrious men, which having for innumerable Ages had a great ſtroke on Earth, at laſt being about to die they perform their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding triumphs, or are recalled into the ſtarry Heaven, there to be as it were bright Stars: and that therfore, famine, popular diſeaſes, and civil wars do follow, as if Cities and Peoples were forſaken by thoſe moſt excellent Captains and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, who did pacifie the offended Deity. Other late Writers, who teach that the Heaven is not ſolid, but a fluid body like the Air, hold that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>omets are not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated below but above the Moon; ſome ſay of exhalations carried thither, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of a part of the Heaven condenſed, and by that means ſhining.</p>
                  <p>And theſe are the chief opinions of Phyloſophers about the nature of Comets: in ſo great a number whereof, 'tis doubtleſs hard to judg which is the trueſt; nor wil the nature of this work, nor my deſign of Brevity ſuffer me at large to examine them all. Yet that it may appear, what we conceive to be moſt probable; their opinion ſeems to us moſt agreeable to truth, who hold that <hi>all Comets have been, and appeared in the Region of Heaven which is above the Moon:</hi> and if any man will call them new Stars, we ſhall not oppoſe him. Now that their abode has been in the Aethereal and not in the Elementary Region, may be gathered, chiefly by the regularity of their motion, the paralaxe, which they have had leſs than the Moon, as alſo by their equal duration. For ſince it has been obſerved that Comets have often endured a long ſpace, and for ſix months together, in the ſame Quantity, and have alwaies had a regular motion: this can no way be attributed to a body compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of exhalations. For al ſuch kind of Meteors, are made after an irregular manner, as may among others be ſeen in the Clouds, in which there is nothing perpetual, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, or regular. And the reaſons which are brought for the contrary opinion, are but weak; and later Authors, do not without cauſe, call in queſtion the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Ancients; ſeeing there is need of great diligence to obſerve the Paralla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes. But whether they are bred anew by natural Cauſes, or are miraculoſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by God, or whether they were before out of ſight, and now at laſt appear, it is no eaſie matter by ſufficient reaſons to determine.</p>
                  <p>Yet this one thing, I think ſit to acquaint you with in this place, that even the Ancients alſo did take Comets to be Stars, which ſometimes appear, and then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain become inviſible, as may be manifeſtly ſeen out of <hi>Hermes Triſmegiſtus in his B. de providentia &amp; fato,</hi> where he thus writes <hi>There is another kind which they call Comets, which appear but for a time, and a while after become inviſible neither ſetting, nor being diſſolved, and others become evident Proclaimers of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Events.</hi> Now thoſe have their place under the Circle of the Sun. When therefore ſomwhat ſhal befall the world, then they appear. And having appeared a few daies returning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain under the circle of the Sun they become inviſible, having ſhewed themſelves in the Eaſt.</p>
                  <p>They ſay that Comets ſignifie wars; becauſe hot and dry exhalations, do breed yellow choler in the bodies of Men eſpecially of Kings, which afterwards make men prone to more violent motions, wrath, brawlings and wars thereof procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Yet verily theſe are too remote cauſes of wars; the Polititians can tel us of neerer cauſes than theſe. And if wars depend hereupon, there is no need of many conſultations, touching the compoſing of wars; we muſt fly to the Phyſitians, who by giving choler-purging medicaments may take away al wars, and pluck up by the roots all the Cauſes of Wars, out of the Bodies of Kings and Princes. Moreover, experience ſhews, that Comets have appeared, which have not been followed by any ſuch events. This is for certain, ſince the Appearance or the Generation of Comets in the Heaven, is very rare and unuſual, that they do undoubtedly portend ſomwhat, if not peradventure as Cauſes, yet as ſigns appointed by God to denounce his wrath againſt ſinful men: whoſe particular ſignification, is nevertheleſs known
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:35070:42"/>only to God, and not reveal to any mortal Man. This indeed hath been found true by the Experience of all Ages.

                  <p>NOw the Bodies of the ſublunary Region are two fold, ſimple and compound. The ſimple, are thoſe which are called Elements, becauſe the reſt are made up of them. Now the term Element which the Greeks call <hi>Stoicheion,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Element has a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</note> although it have ſundry ſignifications, yet it ſeems they may fitly be reduced to two principal ones, the one <hi>General,</hi> the other <hi>ſpecial.</hi> For generally it is taken for whatſoever is firſt in its kind and has nothing before it: in which ſenſe 'tis defined by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the 4. <hi>Metaph. Ch.</hi> 3. <hi>That is called an Element, out of which firſt inexiſting in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual ſpecies, a thing is compounded into another ſpecies.</hi> Moreover in a more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſignification, Elements are the immediate principles of mixt Bodies, and thus are defined by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his 3. <hi>de Caelo. Ch.</hi> 3.1.31. The Element of Bodies is that into which the other Bodies are divided, wherein it is potentially or actually: but it ſelf is not diviſible into parts of ſundry ſorts. And in the ſignification we are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to treat of Elements.</p>
                  <p>And theſe Elements truly have a <hi>twofold</hi> office and a double conſideration.
<note place="margin">Element in that lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſenſe have a twofold Office.</note> For their <hi>firſt</hi> office is, with the Heaven to make up this whol bulk of the world: and in this manner they are abſolutely conſidered according to their eſſence, without any relation to mixt bodies: The <hi>Second</hi> is, to be the matter of mixt Bodies. And for the performance of both theſe Offices, peculiar qualities are given them by Nature. For that they might perform the <hi>former,</hi> they have heavineſs and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: for the <hi>latter,</hi> heat and cold, moiſture and dryneſs; whereby they can mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally work one upon another and make up a compound. Now the Elements are to be conſidered by us in this place, both waies.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe the Elements do firſt perform that Office of theirs whereby they are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to certain places in the world, and do therein naturally reſt;
<note place="margin">The Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ſimple bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and have a ſimple mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> we muſt firſt ſpeak of their motion, and thence draw their Nature and number. The Elements are ſimple Bodies. For although, being conſidered as made up of matter and form, they may be termed compounds, yet in reſpect of mixt Bodies, they are called ſimple. For they are not made up of other Bodies which were before them, but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are the firſt Bodies of themſelves exiſting in the world, of which all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bodies are compounded. Since therefore they are ſimple bodies, a ſimple mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is due to them.</p>
                  <p>Now there are <hi>two</hi> ſimple motions: the <hi>Right</hi> or <hi>Streight,</hi> and the <hi>Circular.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">There are two ſimple motions.</note> The <hi>Circular</hi> belongs to Heaven: and therefore the <hi>Streight</hi> motion we attribute to the Elements, having therein experience to juſtifie what we do. For we ſee theſe Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo called, and all things compounded of them, according to the Nature of the prevailing Element, go in a direct line to their proper place. Now direct motion is either <hi>to the Middle,</hi> or <hi>from the Middle;</hi> to the middle place of the world which is alſo the loweſt, heavy things are carried; from the middle to the outmoſt part
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:35070:43"/>which is alſo the higheſt,
<note place="margin">Why heavy things move down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and light things upwards.</note> light things are carried. For <hi>light</hi> things are ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing un-hindred do alwaies move upwards, and which alwaies ſwim at the top: and <hi>heavy</hi> things are thoſe, which not hindred, are alwaies carried downward, and ſink to the bottom of every thing. But what the cauſe is why ſome Bodies move downwards, others move upwards, we muſt now enquire, and ſee into the end and efficient cauſe of this motion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As to the End,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The end of this moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> ſince Nature does nothing in vain, and all Natural things act for the ſake of ſome good, we muſt not think the Elements are moved with certain mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to no purpoſe; but we muſt hold that every Element is carried to its own place, as to its perfection: whence <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaies well 4. <hi>de Caelo. c. 3. t. 22. For every thing to be carried to its place, is nothing elſe but for every thing to be carried to its own Form.</hi> For the Forms of the Elements being of al others the loweſt and moſt ignoble, and hardly able to defend themſelves ſufficiently from external injuries, their proper place is added to their form as an aſſiſtant to preſerve the Body there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which as it were an external Form, ſupplies what is wanting to the internal Form. To its proper place, therefore, as to its own perfection, every Element is moved. And the perfection which they receive therein, is the preſervation of their, Heat, Cold, Lightneſs, Heavineſs, and conſequently of their Form.</p>
                  <p>As to <hi>the Efficient Cauſe of the motion of the Elements</hi> Authors do many waies va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
<note place="margin">The Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Cauſe.</note> Yet verily, if we ſhall rightly weigh the matter, and not wilfully intangle a a plain matter with difficulties, and rightly mind the ſenſe of the queſtion, it ſeems not ſo hard to anſwer thereunto. For if a man ſhould ask, what is the efficient cauſe, that the Fire and Earth, actually exiſting by their forms, the former mounts right upwards, the letter moves downwards, unleſs they be by ſome other thing violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly detained; we anſwer ſimply; that the Fire by its Form is moved from the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the world upwards, and the Earth by its form is moved to the Centre of the world downwards, for this motion is to them Natural and therfore it muſt alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Nature, or an inward principle, which is their Form, and not from an outward. For this is proper to Natural things, to have in themſelves the principle of their motion, as may be ſeen in the 2. <hi>Phyſic. c.</hi> 9. <hi>t.</hi> 48. Alſo the form of an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which informes it, and is its Nature, is alſo the principle of its motion. Alſo to what hath been ſaid may be added, that as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaies in 2. <hi>Phyſic. c.</hi> 3. <hi>t.</hi> 37. an effect actually exiſting, requires a cauſe actually exiſting; and that eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in effects, whoſe whole eſſence is in the preſent performance, as motion is: for the cauſe hereof being taken away, it is alſo taken away, nor can it ever be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from its efficient cauſe. But the motion of the Elements is an effect actually exiſting. It requires therfore a cauſe actually exiſting; which can be no other then the Form. For this only alwaies actually exiſts with the motion: but thoſe other cauſes which ſome do bring, as the Generator, the Remover of impediments, may be ſeparated from motion, and while it is yet exiſting, they may either periſh, or if they periſh not, yet may they not coexiſt with the motion. Nor does what hath been formerly ſaid of motion, hinder this opinion: that the Moveable is diſtinct from the mover; which ſeems not to agree to the motion of the Elements, if we hold their form to be their mover. For the Earth, when it is moved to the middle of the world, it is not moved, as having matter. For the matter in it ſelf, is no more enclined to move upwards then downwards, but is indifferently capable of al motions; but as it hath a form, which determies and reſtraines the aptitude of the matter, to receive this form. And therefore ſeeing the matter is here the paſſive principle of the motion, it cannot be the active. And this doubt, truly, may be ſatisfied, if we diſtinguiſh betwixt an Agent with the tranſmutation of another thing, which is properly called an efficient, and requires alwaies a Patient diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from it ſelf: and betwixt an Agent only (as they ſay) by emanation of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, which does not by acting change another thing, but after the Nature whereof, the effect follows of its own accord, that as it were not acting; and ſuch an agent is the Form in reſpect of al the accidents which are Naturally in the compound. For all accidents do of their own accord follow the form, without any motion or tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation of the ſubject. That therefore which hath formerly been ſaid concerning
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:35070:43"/>the diſtinction betwixt the moveable and the mover, is true of an Agent by tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. But an Agent by emanation is not neceſſarily diſtinguiſhed from the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. Howbeit, even in an immanent action, or which is produced only by emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we may obſerve ſome diſtinction of Agent and Patient. For the Form, as the form acts; and ſuffers as it is in the matter. And therefore, in the motion of the Elements, the form as the form, is the Efficient Cauſe of the motion; but as it is in the matter, it is moved with it. For the compound is moveable, or is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of motion, which is diſtinguiſhed from the form, in reſpect of the matter. For the matter alſo, is really diſtinguiſhed from the form. And this is the true expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this Queſtion, Dextrouſly propounded, which muſt be by no means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, with other queſtions which border thereupon. For it is quite another queſtion; Why an Element actually exiſting by its form, not hindred by any thing, tends to its own proper place, the cauſe whereof hath been already expreſſed; from this, why for examples ſake, water which of it ſelf moves downwards,
<note place="margin">Why water ever the fire moves upwards?</note> fire being put under, begins to mount up in vapors; or, what is the Cauſe that a Stone which hung in the Air faſtened to a ſtring, as ſoon as the ſtring is cut fals downward. For the cauſe of the former is the admixture of Fiery and Aery particles, which atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate the water, and carry it with themſelves aloft. And the cauſe of the latter is clearly, that which removes the Impediment.</p>
                  <p>The Elements therefore not being hindred, are moved by their forms, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and immediate cauſe, as hath been ſhewed: which formes as all others, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be perceived by ſenſe, but are by us known and deſcribed by heavineſs and lightneſs as accidents. For it is an uſual thing to deſcribe the hidden forms of things, which want peculiar names, by their proper adjuncts, which are better known to us.</p>
                  <p>Moreover what may be the Cauſe,
<note place="margin">Why the Elements are moved leaſurely and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</note> why the Elements are moved ſucceſſively and leiſurely, whether only becauſe of the reſiſtency of the Medium, or through ſome other cauſe, comes now to be enquired. Some late writers are indeed of opinion, that there is a twofold reſiſtency, one external, which proceeds from a ful Medium, which is the Cauſe that motion is ſlower then it would be, if it were performed in an empty ſpace, if ſuch there were: another internal, which proceeds from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the moveable, reſiſting the mover. Howbeit the opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Averrhoes</hi> is truer, who hold, that <hi>the Elements have only an external reſiſtency in their motion, proceeding from the Medium;</hi> (For it being ful and corpulent, reſiſts the mover in its motion, according as it is more or leſs thick) but no internal. For if there were any internal reſiſtency, it ſhould proceed either from the Form or the Matter. Not from the Form: for, it being the mover, does not reſiſt its ſelf in its own motion, but endeavors as ſpeedily as may be, to carry the moveable to its due place. Nor from the matter. For it being meerly paſſive, and indifferent to receive all motions, and having no power to act, can alſo be no cauſe of reſiſtency. All the ſwiftneſs therefore and ſlowneſs of the motion of Elements, depends upon the proportion of the Virtue and power of the mover, to the reſiſtency of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. For when the force of the mover is much greater, then the power of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium to reſiſt, the motion is ſwift: but when the power of the mover does not much exceed the force of the Mediums reſiſtency, there the motion is ſlower: but where the mover does not at al exceed the force which the Medium hath to reſiſt, there is no motion at al. Howbeit what hath been ſaid muſt be underſtood only of the Elements which are ſimple Bodies, and have an internal principle of their moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For in things moved by external force, the caſe is otherwiſe for they by their proper Nature reſiſt the mover, and according to the exceſs, whereby their power is overcome by the power of the mover, they are ſwiftly or ſlowly moved.</p>
                  <p>From what hath hitherto been ſaid the Cauſe may eaſily be rendred;
<note place="margin">Why heavy and light things are moved more ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the beginning, and more ſwiftly at the end?</note> why heavy and light things do move more ſlowly at the beginning and ſwifter at the end. For experience ſhews that an heavy thing falling from an high place, ſmites more ſtrongly where it lights, then it would have done falling from a lower place. For though divers men think differently in this point: yet muſt we reſolve, that the true cauſe hereof, is the abatement of the reſiſtancy of the Medium; and the abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the reſiſtancy proceeds from the forgoing motion, which augments the ſwiftneſs of the following motion. Now why the precedent motion augments the ſwiftneſs of that which follows, and why it abates the re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iſtency, the Cauſe is this.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:35070:44"/>Every movable is ſwiftly and eaſily moved through a Medium, which is moved the ſame way with it; and leſs ſwiftly through a Medium that moves not; ſlowly through a Medium which reſiſts the moveable, and bears the contrary way: an Argument whereof we have in ſailing with or againſt tide. And therefore, when any heavy Body begins to tend downwards firſt the quiet Air reſiſts it, the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtency whereof is nevertheleſs overcome by the heavy Body, and drives the next part of the Air downwards: this firſt part of the Air being driven, drives the ſecond part of the Air, next unto it. And therefore when the heavy Body comes to this part, and finds it not reſiſting but going the ſame way and furthering it in as motion, it begins to be moved more ſwiftly: and the Body being thus more ſwiftly moved, will more vehemently force and drive the third part of the Air: and it being before driven alſo by the ſecond part of the Air, wil be more ſwiftly moved then the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and will more ſtrongly bear down the fourth part. When therefore the heavy Body ſhall reach the third part of the Air, finding it more vehemently mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved downwards then the ſecond, it wil alſo be therein more ſwiftly moved; and ſo it will yet more forcibly bear down the fourth part, being before preſt down by the third, and when it comes to it, it will be therein yet more ſwiftly moved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the leſſer reſiſtency and the Mediums being moved the ſame way. And this ſwiftneſs of the motion wil be for the ſame Reaſon continually augmented even to the End.
<note place="margin">Heavineſs and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are underſtood two waies.</note> But that no obſcurity may remain, we muſt know, that <hi>Heavineſs and Lightneſs are taken two manner of waies,</hi> Either for the firſt act or quality, by which a thing hath a propenſion to move upwards or downwards; or for the ſecond act or operation, and impulſe, by which ſome bodies are moved upwards, others down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Which two things the School-men to diſtinguiſh, they called the former <hi>Gravitatem,</hi> the latter <hi>Gravitationem:</hi> and hence 'tis ſaid that Gravity in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments cannot be augmented, but Gravitation may: alſo, that the Elements in their own places are <hi>Gravia</hi> and <hi>Levia,</hi> heavy and light indeed, but they do not <hi>Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate</hi> nor <hi>Levitate,</hi> that is they ſtrive not to go upwards or a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>wnwards.</p>
                  <p>Now the next thing is,
<note place="margin">The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Elements.</note> that we ſearch into the <hi>Number of the Elements,</hi> about which later writers do wonderfully differ. <hi>I ſhall prove that there are four in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi> And to prove the ſame I ſhall not bring many reaſons; ſeeing our very ſences will eaſily ſhew us how many Elements there be. For we perceive the Water, Earth and Air which fills that vaſt ſpace above the Globe of the Earth, nor in the force of Fire unknown to us. 'Tis here my mind only to produce one reaſon which many uſe. There are two direct motions, one from the middle, another to the middle. Therefore, for theſe two ſimple motions there muſt be two ſubjects which are ſimple Bodies, one which is abſolutely heavy, which is called Earth; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, which is abſolutely light, called Fire. Now becauſe 'tis the wil of Nature that the world ſhould be one; and two contrary extreams cannot make up one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound; ſhe alwaies couples the extreams by things of a middle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ature, and knits the laſt of the upper kind, with the firſt of the lower. And therefore in this caſe, a Medium is requiſite. But this cannot be one only. For if that were allowed, it would poſſeſs the middle place betwixt the extreams, and ſo it could not be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of a direct motion. For neither ſhould it be truly moved from the middle, nor to the middle, but it ſhould be Capable of both theſe motions, and ſo could not be called heavy more then light. And therefore we muſt hold that there are two Mediums, the one of which is light and moves from the middle upwards, but is in ſome reſpect heavy; which is called Air; the other muſt be abſolutely heavy, and tend to the middle, yet in ſome reſpect light; which is called Water. There are therefore four Elements: <hi>Fire, Air, Water, Earth.</hi> There cannot be a ſift, for the ſame cauſe why there cannot be but one Medium. If any one will hold there are more then five, he will be confuted by ſenſe and experience.</p>
                  <p>A queſtion there is,
<note place="margin">Whether the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are found in the world pure.</note> 
                     <hi>Whether theſe Elements are found pure in the World:</hi> To which queſtion we thus anſwer: If the Elements are conſidered abſolutely in that ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, which is due to their Nature, and whereby they are the Rule and ſtandard of mixt Bodies, they are ſurely to be found any where pure. But if they be compared with mixt Bodies, and the queſtion ſhal be; whether they exiſt alſo by themſelves, out of mixed Bodies, it may be ſaid they are found ſincere and pure, not indeed with an abſolute purity, of which we ſpake juſt now, but with ſuch an one, as they are capable of, compared to mixt Bodies. Howbeit the extream are purer then the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:35070:44"/>Middlemore. Nor do the Elements, though they are not found exactly pure, loſe their Name, ſo as to be called mixt Bodies.
<note place="margin">Which are mixt Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies?</note> For thoſe Bodies are only to be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med mixt, wherein there is ſo great a departure from the Nature and purity of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that the Name and Form being caſt away; they come to be now ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent thing from the Elements, and receive a new and peculiar Name of ſome ſort of Natural Body. But wherever there is ſo great an exceſs of one Element, that it tranſcends al compariſon, with the reſt that are joyned with it, in <hi>that</hi> the Name of Element is retained.</p>
                  <p>It now remains that we ſpeak of the Elements in Particular,
<note place="margin">Whether there is any Elementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Fire?</note> as much as the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this work will bear. And to begin with Fire, though many late writers endeavor to caſt it from the number of Natural things, and take ſpecial pains to prove that it does not exiſt under the concave of the Moon: yet ſhall we ſubſcribe to the remarkable conſent of the chief Phyloſophers, to reaſon ſtrong enough, and experience it ſelf eſpecially ſeeing the Arguments brought to the contrary do all in a manner tend to prove, that this fire of ours, is no pure fire; whence notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it follows not, that there is no pure ſire, nor that it is any where to be found: nor though all the properties of our fire do not agree to that under the Moon, does it therefore follow, that it is no true fire; ſeeing moſt of thoſe things which are vulgarly attributed to our Fire, do agree to Fire not of it ſelf, but acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally.</p>
                  <p>For there is a great difference betwixt this Fire of ours which we daily make uſe of, and pure Elementary fire. For our fire of the Kitchen is not pure,
<note place="margin">How Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Fire and Kitchen fire differ.</note> but mixed with vapors and groſs matter, and therefore it ſhines, it burns, it wants fuel. But that there is pure Elementary fire under the Sphere of the Moon, the great lightneſs thereof, and its prepetual endeavor to aſcend, does argue.
<note place="margin">Fire the lighteſt Element.</note> For <hi>it is of all Elements the moſt light and thin Body,</hi> As next in place to Heaven, ſo in Nature moſt of kin thereto, unto which alſo, if forced therefrom, or generated elſewhere, it tends as to its proper place, concerning which matter <hi>Scaliger</hi> in his 9. <hi>Exercitation</hi> thus writes. <hi>The Smoak which aſcends, hath very much fire in it. For it aſcends not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of water: much leſt becauſe of the Earth. Nor does that motion proceed from the Air; for it is already in the Air. What place therefore does it ſeek? That place veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which above the Air is due to the lighteſt of Bodies. And again, theſe are the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of that demonſtration whereby 'tis proved, that the Element of Fire is under the Sphere of the Moon,</hi> viz. <hi>Bodies Natural, Motion, Place. Of theſe are propoſitions certain, True, Primitive, immediate, thus made, the Cauſes of this Concluſion: that the place of Fire is in the upper ſpace under the Moon, above the Air. Every movable thing is a Body: all Fire is movable,</hi> Ergo. <hi>Other two: Every body is in a place; all Fire is a Body,</hi> Ergo. <hi>Thirdly, as many more; Every movable mover Naturally to its own ſpace; Fire is a Body movable,</hi> Ergo. <hi>And the two laſt, which knock the Nail to the Head. Every ſpace to which a Body Naturally moves, is the proper ſpace of that Body; The Fire moves Naturally upwards,</hi> Ergo <hi>the ſpace above, is proper to the Fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The exceeding lightneſs of the Fire is attended by exceeding rarity,
<note place="margin">Why our Kitchin fire Burns?</note> and it hath leaſt matter of al the Elements, and amongſt natural things, it comes neareſt the Nature of Form; and therefore it hath the greateſt activity of al the Elements. Yet, when it is pure, and of it ſelf, it does not burn: but that our Fire burns the Cauſe is; in that it is condenſed, and ſticks in groſs matter, whence its parts being condenſed and brought into a narrow compaſs, attain the greater force. Or as <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaies <hi>in his</hi> 2. <hi>Exercitation, S.</hi> 2. it hath the power of burning from the propinquity, Multitude, Coheſion, Coagmentation and union of its parts. An argument whereof we have in a red hot Iron, wherein the force of the Fire is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe of the condenſation of parts, then it is ſtubble which conſiſts of more ſpungy matter. The ſame appears if you ſet ſpirit of Wine on Fire, for you may draw your finger through the ſame without hurt, as alſo through the upper part of the flame; which in a red hot iron you cannot do. The ſaid Elementary Fire is not of it ſelf viſible, no more than the Air, nor does it ſhine, unleſs it be received in a thick matter.</p>
                  <p>No ſound Phyloſopher denies that the Fire does belong to the Elements,
<note place="margin">Fire is on Element.</note> which make up this world and conſtitute mixt Bodies. For although <hi>Cardan</hi> hath endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored to exclude the ſame from the number of Elements; yet is he well confuted
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:35070:45"/>by <hi>Julius Caeſar Scaliger</hi> in his 9. <hi>Exercitation.</hi> For ſeeing, as he alſo teaches, in his 10. <hi>Exercitation,</hi> that heat which is a moſt manifeſt and effectual Quality is acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally in many things, there muſt of neceſſity be ſome firſt ſubject, wherein it is primarily and eſſentially: For nothing is in any thing accidentally, which is not eſſentially in ſome other thing,
<note place="margin">And the firſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of heat.</note> primarily and of it ſelf. And truly, the firſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of heat is Fire, at firſt created by God with the other Elements, and furniſhed with its qualities. And there was never any time when Fire had not thoſe qualities flowing from the Form thereof. But from the ignorance of the Creation of the world came,
<note place="margin">Not only potentially hot as Ariſtotle would have it.</note> that Opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> which he hath in the 1. <hi>Meteorol. cap</hi> 3. where he ſaies: <hi>Seeing the firſt Element is moved Circularly, the Bodies which are therein, alwaies that which is neareſt at hand, being ſevered by the motion of the lower world and Body, is inflamed and cauſes heat. For thus we muſt underſtand the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the beginning. That Body which is under the upper Circumduction, being it is as it were a kind of matter, and potentially hot and cold, and dry and moiſt, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever other adjuncts follow theſe; ſuch it becomes, and ariſer from motion and Immobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> An abſurd ſaying, truly, and unbecoming ſo great a Phyloſopher! For what matter I pray you can we imagine actually exiſting of it ſelf, which is potentially Hot, Cold, Moiſt, Dry, but actually receives theſe qualities from Heaven? For although ſome that they might ſtick by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> have fancied a twofold heat in Fire, one Natural, which follows the proper form of Fire; the other adventitious, which the Fire receives from the motion of Heaven; yet <hi>Zabarella</hi> in his 1. <hi>B. de qual. prim. c.</hi> 8. writes well, that the words of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> do not receive all this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation; for <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaies, that all this matter of the lower world is potenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Hot, Cold, Moiſt, Dry, but is made actually ſo by motion and immobility. Therefore he allows no heat to the Elements, beſides what they receive from the motion of Heaven. Yet he himſelf fals into a much more abſurd opinion when he writes in <hi>the fallowing Chapter:</hi> thus, <hi>If any Man ſhall aske whether the firſt qualities are ſooner or later then the Forms of the Elements, we muſt ſay, they are fore more and later in ſeveral reſpects. For in Original and according to the order of Generation, they are doubtleſs ſooner, as the previous diſpoſitions are in generation before the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Form, to the eduction whereof they are directed, but they are Naturally after the ſame, in as much as they are accidents. For accidents are after their ſubſtances. And in as much as they are Effects, but the Forms cauſes, I do not mean efficient cauſes but final. For qualities are produced in the matter, for the ſake of ſubſtantial Forms, and are directed to them as to their End, as alſo they are conſerved in the Elements by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that the Elements themſelves might be conſerved; ſo that the next final cauſe of theſe Qualities, is the Conſtitution of the Elements; but the remote and ultimate, is the production of mixt Bodies. For the Elements are made for the mixt Bodies, and to be their matter. Thus therefore Qualities may be ſaid to follow the Forms of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in as much as the Forms are their final cauſes: but the qualities themſelves, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are preparations for the Eduction of Forms, they may not therefore be called the Cauſes of the Forms, but only the latter Effects; ſeeing accidents are Naturally later then ſubſtances. And therefore while they are together in the Elements, as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally conjoyned and ſubſtantial Forms and proper qualities; yet the Forms are in the firſt place, and the qualities afterwards, and ſo they are ſaid to follow the Forms of the Elements; eſpecially ſeeing, as we ſaid before, they are given to the Elements by Heaven, for the Eduction and preſervation of their Forms.</hi> For if heat be a diſpoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion previous to the reception of the form of Fire, into what matter I pray you is that diſpoſition introduced, and in what matter is the Heat inherent, before the Form of Fire comes. And will the Form of Fire be idle, will it ſhed forth no qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity? Thus one abſurdity being gathered infinite do follow.</p>
                  <p>Now the Fire of it ſelf,
<note place="margin">It is a ſubſtence.</note> is a ſubſtance moſt ſubtil, and thin, piercing through al things; which neither ſhines, nor is ſeen whileſt it is p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>re and ſimple without any mixture. But when it is mixt with and is inherent in other things, it makes our vulgar Kitchin Fire, which differs not Eſſentially from the pure Element of Fire, but herein only in that it is mixed with ſome Hererogeneal matter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thomas Fienus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Not an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident.</note> indeed, in his <hi>Apology</hi> againſt <hi>Sanctacruze, p.</hi> 50. holds that this Fire of ours which we uſe, is only an accident. But the Reaſons of that opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are refuted in my 3. <hi>Hypomne. Phyſ. Ch.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:35070:45"/>
                  <p> And ſince this Kitchin Fire of ours, is uſeful to many intents and purpoſes,
<note place="margin">The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventors of Kitchin Fire.</note> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny authors write many things touching the Inventors thereof, as may be ſeen in <hi>Plinies Natural Hiſtory, B.</hi> 4. <hi>Ch.</hi> 12. and <hi>Book</hi> 6. <hi>Ch.</hi> 30. <hi>in Vitruvius Book</hi> 2. <hi>Ch.</hi> 1. But it is apparent by the ſacrifices and by the ſtory of <hi>Tubal-Cain,</hi> that the uſe thereof was known to the firſt Fathers of the world. Though it is not to be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that the other uſes thereof were later known to other Nations; and new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions are alwaies added; as may be ſeen in Gun-powder, and ſundry ſorts of Fireworks, made thereof.</p>
                  <p>Now what the difference is betwixt Fire as it is potentially in mixt Bodies,
<note place="margin">'Tis either Potential, or Actual.</note> and as it is actually hot, is not eaſie to explain, yet a thing neceſſary to be known. For Sulphur to feel to is as cold as a cold ſtick that hath no Brimſtone in it; and a piece of Willow Wood dried is not colder to feel to then a piece of Pitch-Tree Wood. And ſpirit of Wine which contains much Fire in it, in coldneſs to feel to, is not inferior to the Wine it ſelf. Yea in a flame which actually is hot, there is leſs quantity of Fire and of the ſmal particles thereof, then in Brimſtone; ſince in Brimſtone not ſet on Fire, that is united in a ſmal ſpace, which is diffuſed in a great flame. In Gun-powder a mighty Quantity of Fiery Atomes lie hid, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs cold to feel to. But the flame of the ſaid Gun power, when it is ſet on Fire, burns exceedingly, though the Atomes are ſevered. This therefore is to be explained, why in a mixt body potentially hot, ſo many fiery Atomes contained and collected, do produce no actual heat; or, what it is that cauſes the Fire to heat.</p>
                  <p>The Former happens, becauſe the Fire is mixt with other things,
<note place="margin">What maks the fire not to heat or to heat.</note> and is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned quiet under the dominion of a ſuperior Form. But it heats actually, when it is ſeparated from the reſt of the Bodies, wherewith it was mixed, and being ſet at liberty, freely acts. Of which latter we ſhall now ſpeak.</p>
                  <p>But actual Fire is variouſly diſpoſed. For if it be pure,
<note place="margin">Pure fire neither ſhines nor, is ſeen.</note> it neither ſhines nor is ſeen. Of which <hi>Scaliger</hi> in his 9. <hi>Exercitation. Meat roaſted on Spits is not touched by the Fire we ſee, but it is touched by the Fire we ſee not: and it is ſo touched, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, as to be burnt to a Coal.</hi> In like manner, if a man hold his Hand over the flame, ſo that the flame do not touch it, yet his Haud wil burn. Fire alſo is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in quick Lime, when water is poured thereon, in dung when it rots, in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Oyl, Stones, Metal, which are heated.</p>
                  <p>Now Fire appears to the ſight and not only to the touch, two manner of waies;
<note place="margin">It becomes viſible two waies.</note> two manner of waies; either in an hot Coal or Flame, as <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> teaches in his <hi>Book de Igne,</hi> Now by a Coal is underſtood any Body red hot, that affords no flame.</p>
                  <p>But that we may rightly underſtand, what Flame and Inflamation is,
<note place="margin">Touching flame and Inflamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> we muſt of neceſſity preſuppoſe ſome Principles.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt is: That there is Fire in all Bodies, and that ſo as to retain its perfect Form, as I have demonſtrated in <hi>Hypomnem. Phyſ.</hi> 3.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Axioms.</hi> 1.</note> Howbeit it is in a greater quantity in ſome Bodies in a leſſer quantity in others.</p>
                  <p>The Second is: That actual Fire is alwaies Naturally moved.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And whereas it is not ſo in mixed Bodies, the reaſon is, becauſe it is contained quietly with other things in the compound under the dominion of an higher Form. For the Forms are the bands of things.</p>
                  <p>The Third is: Fire is two manner of waies in compounds, the one as fixed,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> in Salts and other things not inflamable, nor combuſtible; the other, as volatile, ſo that by means thereof, the Body in which it is, may be inflamed; after which manner it is in Sulphur and al Bodies that partake of Sulphur. Upon which account, thoſe Bodies which have Fire good ſtore in them, are eaſily burnt by Fire, which, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> in his 9. <hi>Exercitation,</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Gives back aſhes to the Earth moiſture to the water, and takes and keeps to it ſelf, that which is inviſible to vulgar Eyes, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceal it ſelf from the Minds of wiſe men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Fourth is: That there is a Conſent of Natural things, and things like are drawn to like. But contrary things Fly from one another <hi>Ex Hyponem. Phyſ.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>The Fift is: That Fire hath a great ſimilitude and likeneſs to things that are apt to flame; becauſe they conſiſt of Fire for the moſt part, and Fire does eaſily unite it ſelf to them.</p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:35070:46"/>
                  <p> Hence we conclude,
<note place="margin">The actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fire what it is.</note> that the Actuation or actual breaking out of Fire, is the ſeparation of that Fire which is potentially in mixt Bodies, from other things mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therewith. I ſay potentially, not in reſpect of the Firſt act, or the Form of Fire, which it hath really in the mixt Body, but in reſpect of the ſecond act and operation thereof.</p>
                  <p>Which ſeparation is made divers waies,
<note place="margin">The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners therof</note> as was ſaid before, with ſlame, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out flame. Without flame in putrefaction, quick Lime, hot Coals; with flame, when Bodies are ſet on a flaming Fire.</p>
                  <p>Of which to ſpeak ſomwhat in particular,
<note place="margin">What in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>amation. 5.</note> we ſay: that inflamation or ſetting on a flame, is, the breaking out of Fire from a Body apt to flame, and containing a Sulphureous Exhalation, cauſed by the touch of Fire near applied. For when Fire already actuated, does touch a body inflamable, the Fire therein, is attracted by the external fire, and by reaſon of ſimilitude, moves of its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord thereto, and unites it ſelf therewith.</p>
                  <p>Now flame is Fire breaking out of an inflamable Body,
<note place="margin">What flame is.</note> touched by actual fire, and ſticking in the fume, as in a Sulphureous Exhalation, and ſhining therein, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved therewith. And therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in 1 <hi>Meteor. Ch.</hi> 4. deſines flame to be the <hi>Boyling out of dry Fire</hi> and in the 4. <hi>Meteoral Cap.</hi> 9. <hi>Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ning Smoak.</hi> For ſlame is Fire, but not pure, joyned with a Dry and inflamable exhalation. And when it is ſet on fire, the fire extends much farther then the flame. And therefore, as hath been ſaid, meat roaſted on ſpits, is touched indeed by the ſire, but not by the flame, and a mans hand held above the flame, may be burned, and paper or a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle may be lighted alſo above the flame. Howbeit ſire is then only ſeen, where being in a great quantity, hath a certain Fuliginous matter ari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now actual Fire <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> ingendred,
<note place="margin">Actual fire is bred two waies</note> and at laſt breaks into flame, either by propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or by Coition, and union. The firſt is cauſed, when actual fire manifeſt to the ſences, does touch another inflamable body, and ſets it on fire, drawing out the fire which lay hid therein. The ſecond is, when fire which lies ſecretly hid in mixt Bodies, is drawn out, without the contract of external fire, and being united does actually and manifeſtly ſhew it felf.</p>
                  <p>The firſt manner is moſt common, when actual fire does ſet on fire other infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Bodies. For by reaſon of affinity, it is eaſily united to them, and draws out and unites to it ſelf the fire in them. <hi>Galen</hi> in his <hi>B de uſu reſpirat.</hi> calls that ſame inflamable Body <hi>the Root of Fire:</hi> and <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> in his <hi>B. de Igne</hi> termes it <hi>the Beginning of Fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And becauſe all things,
<note place="margin">Things which have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere ſulphur in them, eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed.</note> are inflamed and kindled by means of Sulphur; thoſe things that have ſincere unmixt Sulphur in them; or though they have little thereof in them; yet are ſo diſpoſed, that fire may eaſily inſinuate it ſelf into all their parts; ſuch things I ſay are eaſily ſet on fire. For in the firſt place, if the Sulphur by much and pure, and not mixed in its ſmal parts with other things, but is of it ſelf alone immediately obvious to the external fire, it is eaſily united thereto, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of its ſimilitude: Contrarily ſuch Bodies as have their Sulphur, though much in Quantity, mingled in its ſmal parts with other things, are not eaſily inflamed. Whence it happens that Pitch Wood is more eaſily kindled then Oak wood, though 'tis a queſtion whether there be more Fire in Pitch wood then in Oak. For in the Former, the fiery Sulphureous parts are unmixt and at hand; but in the latter the inflamable fiery parts lie deep, yet are they diſcovered by their effects in warming of a Stove. By reaſon of plenty of unmixt Sulphur, ſpirit of Wine does ſoon take flame, and the purer it is and more ſeparated from the Flegm, the ſooner it is ſet on fire. But this is ſeen moſt of all in Bitumen, which is exceeding Sulphureous, and containes in it a ſpirituous matter, of kin to fire, and therefore is ſoon lighted, and conceives flame even far from the Fire, as <hi>Pliny</hi> in <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>C.</hi> 105. ſaies, Fire leaps to it wherever it ſees it. And After this manner they ſay <hi>Medea</hi> ſet <hi>Jaſons</hi> Concubine on Fire, as <hi>Pliny</hi> writes <hi>in the ſame place.</hi> For when <hi>Medea</hi> had given to <hi>Creuſa</hi> a Crown or Garland ſmeared with Bitumen, and perſwaded her to be preſent at the ſacrifices, the Garland ſmeard with Bitumen, took flame from the Fire and lighted wood, and ſo burnt <hi>Creuſa.</hi> And I remember, when I was making Balſam of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, and had put into a Glaſs Receiver, flower of Brimſtone, ſpirit of Terpentine
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:35070:46"/>and ſpirit of Wine, that they might ſtand in digeſtion, and left it to the care of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Student, to cover the mouth of the Receiver with a Glaſs Cover and cloſe it up with ſpaniſh wax; ſome of the ſpaniſh wax being lighted and falling upon the lid, the Spirit in the Receiver was ſet on flame, although it was hardly a ſixt part ful. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto belong common Brimſtone, Gun-powder, Pitch, Aſphaltum, Ambar: Hence <hi>Galen</hi> relates in his 3. <hi>de Temperam Chap.</hi> 2. that a man in his daies, made a great boaſt of lighting a Candle after a wonderful manner, which he firſt put out &amp; then appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to a wal to light it, which he made ſhew to be done without Fire, which though ſome thought it to be a magical operation; yet when it was known, that the ſaid wall was ſmeared with Brimſtone and liquid bitumen, the wonder ceaſed. Like hereunto, is that which <hi>Cardan</hi> relates in his tenth Book <hi>de Varietate Rerum,</hi> of a certain man who would light Candles not perfectly extinguiſhed at the mouth of a certain Image, which was made on purpoſe and daubed with Sulphur and Bitumen or Petroleum, that ſo the Image might ſeem to vomit Fire.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, Bodies ſpungy and dry, though they have little ſulphur in them,
<note place="margin">Why dry bodies are eaſieſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlamed.</note> yet becauſe they are dry, and the watry parts, which otherwiſe do moſt of all hinder kindling into a Flame, are abſent, the Fire eaſily unites it ſelf to the ſulphur which is in them, whence they come to kindle. Such bodies are, dry Wood, Torches, Straw, Stubble, dry Hay, Tow, Wool, Paper, Tutch-wood, Links.</p>
                  <p>But that ſome things, as Oyl, Suet, Wax, which contain ſtore of Sulphur in them,
<note place="margin">Why viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous and watry bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are hard to take fire.</note> are not eaſily ſet on fire, but need ſtore of fire to light them, as when they are boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or muſt have a wiek to cauſe them burn: the reaſon is, becauſe thoſe bodies are viſcous and clammy, and not ſpungy, and becauſe they ſtick together in their ſmal parts. Alſo, becauſe they have a watry Subſtance, mixed with their ſmalleſt parts. And the mixture of watry parts, does moſt of all hinder Inflamation. For Water as much as any thing hinders the breaking out of flame.</p>
                  <p>For ſeeing Water mingled with Wood, only by the roots thereof, does render them leſs ſubject to take ſire, much more wil that Water do it, which is moſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately mixt with the ſulpur. But if a dry wiek be added to Oyl, Suet, or Wax; the flame or actual fire in the wiek, draws to it ſelf its cozen ſire mixt in the matter cloſe by, but flowly, becauſe it cannot do it plentifully. For that ſame watrineſs hinders, which muſt firſt be removed, that the ſulphureous part may be lighted. Now this is ſlowly diſpelled: which alſo while it is in doing, the fire alſo flies away, and ſo it needs new to ſucceed it, which it does becauſe it is freed from the Water. And indeed in every body which feeds fire ſlowly, there is ſomwhat which reſiſts fire. For otherwiſe there were no reaſon, why the fire ſhould not be altogether ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly inflamed, as it happens in Tow or Straw. And Brimſtone it ſelf affords a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt example hereof, which does indeed ſoon take fire, and yet is long before it burn out, becauſe it has in it ſtore of acid ſpirit, which hinders the Inflamation.</p>
                  <p>Now the flame which we ſee kindled in any matter, is not alwaies the ſame; ſeeing the fire is in continual motion and flies away, a new fire comes freſh and freſh out of the thing burning. And therefore as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaies, <hi>Meteor</hi> 2. <hi>The flame never continues the ſame.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And whereas it is commonly ſaid that ſulphureous things,
<note place="margin">How the Fire is fed</note> and whatever wil kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, is the food of fire; <hi>that</hi> muſt be rightly underſtood. For it is not ſimply true, becauſe fire is a ſimple body, which properly is not nouriſhed. But in that the fire cleaves to the body inflamed, it is not becauſe it needs food, but becauſe through ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude, it endeavors to draw out the fire lying hid in the body inflamed, and to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite it to ſelf, and ſo to multiply it ſelf. For every Nature deſires to multiply it ſelf, and there is in every thing an appetite of Infinity and Eternity, as <hi>I. C. Scaliger</hi> ſaies <hi>in his</hi> 9. <hi>Exercit.</hi> which is chiefly effected by union with its like. And therefore fire ſticks ſo long at leaſt to the body inflamed, as there is ſulphur and fire therein, which failing, it ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es away.</p>
                  <p>Alſo from the Premiſes the difference appears between a flame,
<note place="margin">The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning things that flame and thoſe that do not flame.</note> and burning coals or other things which yeild no flame. Flame, as has been ſaid, is joyned with fuliginous vapors, and there is more fuliginous matter in a flame than in coals. For when the char-coals were made, the greateſt part of the fuliginous matter flew away. And becauſe abundance of fuliginous matter does choak the flame, yea and the fire it ſelf, and hinders the ſudden propagation thereof, of neceſſity the fuligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous vapor muſt have egreſs, whence it comes often to paſs that fire lies hid in a
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:35070:47"/>cloſe chamber, but flame ariſes not therefrom. But as ſoon as the door or window is opened, and a paſſage is given to the ſooty vapors, it breaks forth into a flame. And becauſe the coals themſelves have yet in them ſome fuliginous matter, the fire conſumes the coals no faſter, than the fuliginous vapors can find egreſs. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thongh the whol furnaces of Chymiſts are at once filled full of coals, the fire conſumes no more of the coals, than is anſwerable to the egreſs of the fuliginous vapors, and ſo by opening or ſhutting, more or fewer, greater or ſmaller vent-holes, a man may moderate the fire as he pleaſes. For no more fire is kindled than the Prohibiter wil allow. Yea and coals may be ſo ſet on fire as that they ſhall not conſume after this manner. Take a ſtrong pipkin or ſtone pot, which will endure the fire, fil it with coals, and put on the cover and lute it round about, and when the lute is dry, put the pot into the mid'ſt of a fire, that the whol pot may be red hot; and then the coals wil be all on fire (and if any wil not beleeve it, he may by breaking the pot be ſure of it) which being done, ſuffer the pot being taken out of the fire to grow cold of it ſelf, then open or break the pot, and you ſhal find all your coals whol. The cauſe whereof is becauſe as the fire entred in through the pot ſides, ſo it goes out the ſame way, but the ſubſtance of the coals cannot paſs the pot ſides.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit we muſt here obſerve that it is not common to all fire,
<note place="margin">What fire needs a free Air, what not.</note> nor does it agree to fire as fire to be extinguiſhed in a cloſe place. For its known by Hiſtories, that there have been lights which have burnt long in a cloſe veſſel: but this is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of ſome ſort of fire only, namely of that which comes out of a mixt ſulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous body, as Wood or the like, with fumes and exhalations. For the flame only which ariſes from ſuch bodies, being ſhut up is extinguiſhed. For ſince in a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al flame there is a reſolution of mixt bodies, and the mixt body is reſolved into other things whereof it was compounded, and a body reſolved requires a larger ſpace, than that which is cloſe compacted, it happens, becauſe there is no place for the fuliginous vapors which ſteam out, part oppreſſes part; and becauſe naturally there is no penetration of dimenſions, while the compound is hindred from being reſolved or looſened, the cauſe alſo of the diſſolution is ſtopped, which is the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al fire.</p>
                  <p>And all theſe things which we have ſaid, appertain to the firſt manner of genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Fire, <hi>viz.</hi> when actual Fire is applied to a combuſtible Body, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible or inflamable body is kindled by Fire put to it.</p>
                  <p>By this manner of Fire many things are made and prepared for the uſe of man:
<note place="margin">The ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry uſes of this fire.</note> and hence come not only the melting and never breaking Fires of Chymiſts and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Artiſts, and thoſe which are uſed in Kitchins, Stoves and Chambers to warm us; but alſo Candles, Torches, Links and Lamps. Candles, Links and Torches are made of Tallow, Wax, Pitch, Roſin, with wicks of Cotton and Cordage. Lamps are made of Oyl with Cotton, in a Glaſs or other Veſſel. They are made to give light in dark places. Oyl of Olives, Line-ſeed, Ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now that which primarily and principally burns, is the Oyl or other inflamable li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, which the wiek draws, which is hereby apparent, in that there are ſome ſnufts that wil not conſume with Fire, ſuch as thoſe made of the Wood Asbeſtum, of which <hi>Pliny</hi> ſpeaks in <hi>his B.</hi> 19. <hi>ch.</hi> 1. <hi>and</hi> 2. <hi>and Book</hi> 36. <hi>ch.</hi> 19. and of the ſtone Amiantos, of which <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> ſpeaks in his 5. <hi>B. ch.</hi> 147. as alſo of <hi>alumen plumo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum.</hi> But if the wiek be combuſtible, it is ſecondarily both inflamed and burnt up.</p>
                  <p>And although Water do quench Fire,
<note place="margin">Lamps burning in water.</note> yet Lamps may be made, which burn in Water and are extinguiſhed in Oyl; if namely the Wick be ſoaked in liquid Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, and put into Water and ſo lighted: for then it wil burn in the Water; but if Oyl be powred to it inſtead of Water, 'twil go out.</p>
                  <p>And that the Oyl may burn the longer,
<note place="margin">Durable Lamps.</note> certain metallick ſubſtances muſt be mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therewith. So if you take one pound of red Lead half a pound of Ceruſs, four ounces of quick Sulphur, common Oyl two pound, and mix them all in a Mortar by the Fire ſide, leiſurely ſtirring it ſomtimes, and then digeſt them Eight daies in a Glaſs retort, and at laſt diſtil them, you wil have an Oyl which wil laſt a long time in Lamps. Or thus: Take Liturige one pound, live Brimſtone four ounces, Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone one ounce. Let al being poudred be incorporated with two pints of Oyl O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:35070:47"/>Let this mixture digeſt ten daies together; and let it be ſtirred about once a day, afterwards diſtil it with a retort, and uſe the Oyl for a Lamp. If you would uſe ſpirit of Wine for a Lamp, to make it laſt long, pour it upon equal parts of unſlak't Lime, crude Tartar, and Brimſtone, and diſtill it once through a retort. Or pour ſpirit of Wine upon equal parts of unſlak'd Lime, crude Tartar, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Salt, and ſo diſtil it. Concerning the Lamp of <hi>Ammon</hi> ſee <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Treatiſe <hi>De defectu oraculorum.</hi> Alſo <hi>Cardan</hi> deſcribes perpetual Lamps in his 10. <hi>de Rerum Varietate</hi> and in his 1 <hi>de Subtil. de principiis rerum, Caput</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p>And ſo much touching the firſt manner of the Generation of Fire,
<note place="margin">Hitherto belongs the propogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of fire by the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams.</note> to which if any man wil refer that alſo, which is cauſed by the Sun's beams, I ſhal not quarrel with him. For if the beams of the Sun be ſo collected in a burning Glaſs artificially made to that end, that meeting in a point, they ſet on fire a combuſtible body, they do the ſame thing that fire applied does.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, There are alſo other waies,

                  <p>In the firſt place,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſince in Putrefaction the Heat and fire which lurk in the mixt body exhales, and thereby become united, by putrefaction,
<note place="margin">By putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</note> Fire is ſomtimes kindled. And it is known to Country-men, how hot an heap of dung wil grow, ſo that the ſtraw therein wil be quite burn'd. So they relate out of <hi>Theophraſtus,</hi> that a Ship laden with moiſt Cloaths, conceived Fire and was burnt up. Nor is it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known that heaps and Stacks of moiſt Hay and Corn have been burnt up. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit in matter putrifying hardly can there be ſo great an heat raiſed, that the matter ſhould flame, unleſs it gather ſtrength elſwhere. An example whereof <hi>Galen</hi> has in his 3. <hi>de Temperam Cap.</hi> 2. where he writes: that Pigeons dung was caſt neer the window of an houſe in <hi>Myſia,</hi> in the middle of a moſt hot Summer. The dung there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore putrifying, and being heated by the Sun, ſent forth a fiery vapor, which ſet on Fire the boards of the Window which were ſmeared with Rozin, and at laſt burnt the whol Houſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Fire is collected and kindled by flight of its contrary;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> a manifeſt exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whereof we have in Quick Lime, upon which if water be poured it grows ſo hot,

Howbeit there is a diſſent amongſt Authors touching the Reaſon of this growing hot of Lime when Water is poured upon it. <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> in his Book <hi>de Igne,</hi> writes thus thereof: <hi>Seeing Heat is not without moiſture or exhalation, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Lime burnt when Water is put to it, rather than alone.</hi> He ſeems to think, that Fire lies hid in the Lime, but that it is not pierced without matter; but Water being poured upon it, it is brought into act, and exhales with the vapor,
<note place="margin">Pet. Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſis.</note> and ſo affects the touch. <hi>Petrus Aponenſis</hi> conceivs the Cauſe to be, that the Heat being kept in by Antiperiſtaſis of the cold Water becomes more forcible.
<note place="margin">J. C. Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger.</note> 
                     <hi>Jul. Caeſ. Scaliger</hi> in his 5. Exercitation Sect 9. thus writes: <hi>In the paſſages of the Lime, the natural moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture being conſumed, there lurks Fire: which flying from the Ingreſs of the Water, and thruſting it ſelf into the ſolid parts, it collects it ſelf, and becomes ſharpened by condenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for the piece of Lime, whoſe half only is covered with Water, as far as it is out of the Water grows hot, receiving into ſelf that Heat which is baniſht out of the other parts.</hi> The Comentator upon <hi>Theophraſtus, de Igne</hi> blames <hi>Scaliger,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentator upon</hi> The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophraſtus.</note> becauſe in the Lime it does not ſo fall out that one part receives the Water, another part the Fire. For the Water ſoaks through, and every where fils all the paſſages, nor can this Collection and denſation of the Fire be made in the inner part of the Lime as in a Tower of Refuge.</p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:35070:48"/>
                  <p> And in good deed,
<note place="margin">They are examined.</note> true it is, that ſome humor exhales cut of the Lime, with the Fire. But thus a cauſe is not ſhewed, why at laſt the fire begins to exhale with the Water, and why in other hot Bodies, water poured on does not produce the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Nor hath the Antiperiſtaſis of <hi>Petrus Aponenſis</hi> any place here, ſince experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence teſtifies that the heat is rather poured out, then that it gathers it ſelf inwards. So alſo there is no ſuch Concentration of the Fire as <hi>Scaliger</hi> imagines; for as ſoon as ever the Water is poured on, it pierces into all parts of the Lime.</p>
                  <p>I conceive therefore that the opinion firſt propounded is the trueſt.
<note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> Namely, In the Lime there are many atomes of Fire, not ſo much they, which the violence of the fire could not draw out, as thoſe which have inſinuated themſelves during the long time of its burning in the Kil. For Chalk is of a Spungy Body. Therefore water being poured on, it penetrates into all parts of the Lime, which the fire avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as contrary thereunto, it exhales, and ſo becomes ſenſible. And becauſe the Lime contains yet ſome moiſture in it, whereby it hangs together, that unites it ſelf to the water poured on, and leaves the Body, whereupon the Body of the chalk is diſſolved and reduced to pouder.</p>
                  <p>Upon this Ground,
<note place="margin">Mixtures made to burn with water or ſpittle.</note> mixtures are made which are ſet on fire, being wet with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Yea, or with Spittle: <hi>viz.</hi> If a like Quantity of Ship-Pitch, Greek Pitch, Sulphur, Tartar, Niter and Petroleum be mingled together, and double the weight of all in unſlak't Lime, be added, and all made up with the Yolks of Eggs, and ſome daies digeſted in Horſe Dung or in <hi>Balneo.</hi> This mixture is ſet on fire by Rain or any other moiſture. The like mixture may be made of Unſlak't Lime, Sulphur, a little Gum Arabick, and Line-ſeed Oyl: whereof bals being made, they wil be ſet on fire by Water thrown on them. So, if you ſill an Egg-ſhell half ful of unſlak't Lime, and put Gum-powder on the top and ſtop the hole with wax: Then the ſaid maſs Thrown into cold Water, will be ſet on Fire.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Fire may be raiſed by motion: which comes to paſs, by the mutual rubbing together of two Bodies,
<note place="margin">By motion.</note> which have Fire in them. For by rubbing and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Fire which did lie ſtil in mixt Bodies, kept in bondage by an higher form, and throughly mixt with contrary things, is moved, and ſo gains motion and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity. And this betides more eaſily, if on woods now a while rub'd one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Gun-powder, or Powder of Brim-ſtone or ſuch like be ſtrewed. So <hi>Pliny</hi> in his 16. <hi>B. Ch.</hi> 4. writes that <hi>the Mulberry Tree, the Bay-Tree, and the Ivy and all Trees out of which Fire is gained, are hot Trees. Spies in Camps and Shep-herds have found this Experiment, becauſe they have not alwaies a Flint at Hand to ſtrik Fire. They Rub therefore one piece of Wood againſt another, whence Fire ariſes, which is received on tinder, a dry Muſhrom or withered leaves of Trees. But nothing excels Ivy which muſt be rubbed with Bay, or let the Bay Wood be rubbed with the Ivy. Alſo the wild Vine is approved in this caſe, not that which is cal'd Labruſca, but another ſort, which Climbes Trees like Ivy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Some refer hither the manner whereby Fire is kindled by the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams,
<note place="margin">By the Sun beams.</note> of which we ſpeak above, in the firſt manner of gaining Fire. Whereof we allow every Man to Judg as he pleaſes. The thing is of it ſelf manifeſt and wel known, that by burning Glaſſes and other Glaſſes, Wood, Paper and other dry things are ſet on fire. With ſuch kind of Glaſſes <hi>Archimedes</hi> ſet on Fire the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Gallies and burnt them up. Of which ſee what the Teachers of Opticks ſay, and <hi>Johannes Baptiſta Porta.</hi> Yea, and the Raies of the Sun may kindle fire without any Glaſſes, and experience hath ſhewed, that woods and bituminous Lands and Seas, have been accidentally ſet on Fire by the Sun's Beams.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>J. C. Scaliger</hi> in the ſame <hi>Exercitation,
<note place="margin">Scaligar, <hi>refers to the Head the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuation of the Air: but he is confuted.</hi>
                        </note> Sect.</hi> 1. hath yet another manner of the generation of Fire, and conceives it may be made out of attenuated Air; where thus he writes: <hi>We muſt confeſs that out of the Air moved, ſmitten and attenuated heat may be cauſed. Which if it proceed it turns to the ſubſtance of Fire, and that by Reaſon of the attenuation of parts.</hi> But that this is falſ, does thus appear, that Stones and the hardeſt Bodies ſmitten together, do not cauſe any ſparkles of Fire, unleſs they have ſtore of Sulphur in them. And the Sulphur which is forced out of flints may be perceived by its ſmel. Moreover the Air cannot be inflamed, either by rubbing or any other way, but this is the property only of mixt Sulphureous Bodies. And if the Air it ſelf could be ſet on Fire, this lower Region of the Air had been long a go
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:35070:48"/>burnt up, at the burning of great woods and Cities. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> truly, in his 2 <hi>de Caelo, Ch</hi> 7. <hi>Text</hi> 42. and 1. <hi>Meteor, Text</hi> 3. Writes that the Air being moved is ſet on fire, and that arrows by motion grow ſo hot, that the Leaden points have melted. But I do not believe the truth of ſuch reports.
<note place="margin">Whether the points of darts do melt.</note> And if the Leaden points of darts could meit, much more ſhould bullets grow hot, that are ſhot out of Guns, which they do not. And <hi>Pareus,</hi> in his <hi>Apologiſmus Primus</hi> ſaies that bullets ſhot againſt an hard Stone have been preſently taken up without hurting a Mans Hand. And if Leaden points of darts or Leaden bullets, did grow hot with motion, much more would wax grow hot; and yet experience hath taught us that a bullet made of wax ſhot out of a Gun hath not melted, but hath gone through a boord two fingers thick.</p>
                  <p>So much for the manners of the generation of Fire. Contraiwiſe Fire goes out,
<note place="margin">Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, Fire goes out.</note> eſpecially flame, when either the inflamable matter fails, or though it be preſent, it is hindred from flaming, and the Fire not ſuffered to come out of the mixt Body.</p>
                  <p>For in the firſt place, when the inflamable Body fails, the flame ceaſes,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> when all the Sulphur which was in the Body is conſumed. So when Tallow, Wax,
<note place="margin">Either through deffect of inflamable matter.</note> or Oyl fail, the flame dies in the Wiek and Lamp; and when the wood is quite burnt and reduced to aſhes, the Fire goes out; becauſe that which was there before, flies away, and no more follows it. For <hi>Flame is alwaies in generation and being bred it periſhes immediatly,</hi> as <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> ſpeaks in his <hi>Book de Igne.</hi> For while the fire is made by conſuming the fewel, when the fewel is gone the fire goes out. For the fire properly does not die or periſh, but flies away: yet becauſe it ſticks ſo long to the inflamable Body, as long as there is any thing to be kindled and burn, when that fails, it is thought to die. This firſt manner of extinction, which is cauſed by defect of ſuel, is by <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> in his <hi>Book de Igne</hi> called, <hi>A Corruption allmoſt Natural, and moſt properly ſo called.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Touching the kindling and going out of Fire,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The double motion of a flame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to</hi> Galen.</note> 
                     <hi>Galen</hi> hath an excellent place <hi>in his Book de reſpirat. Cap.</hi> 3. Where he writes: <hi>All flames are moved with a double motion, the one from the matter, out of which they are kindled, by which they mount aloft and ſpred abroad every way; the other contrary to this, is to their beginning and their Roots as it were, by which they ſettle and are contracted. For if you light a brand on the very top, the fire comes ſuddenly to the lower parts; and if after you have blown out the flame of a candle, and you ſhall hold another candle over the Smoak of the ſnuf, you ſhall ſee it preſently lighted, which could not ſo fal out, if the fire moved only upwards.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The cauſe of this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> And he adds that this is the cauſe of the ſaid double motion, <hi>ſeeing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>every flame is moſt ſpeedily corrupted: for it is alwaies ſcattered by the ambient Air, therefore it is neceſſary that its generation ſhould alſo be very quick; otherwiſe it would not laſt the leaſt moment. Now the generation of all flame comes out of the matter, therefore it hath not without cauſe given it by Nature, not only a motion outwards from its proper prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, but one contrary thereunto, turning towards its own proper principle. And all flame muſt needs be corrupted, if it want either matter, or one of theſe motions.</hi> In which place of <hi>Galen,</hi> thoſe two motions of flame, are diligently to be conſidered. Firſt, The Fire is carried to the Body inflameable, and the matter, or Root, as <hi>Galen</hi> cals it, by reaſon of affinity, and it goes on al ſides: the other is whereby the fire which is drawn out, is naturally carried upwards.</p>
                  <p>Now the waies whereby the inflameable matter being preſent,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the flame never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs decaies, are many, which all of them have this in common,
<note place="margin">
                        <p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Which comes to paſs again.</hi>

                     </note> that in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, the actuated fire goes away, and no more actuated fire does ſucceed it, from the mixt Body inflamed.</p>
                  <p>This proceeds firſt from ſuffocation; <hi>viz.</hi> when as the fire breaking out of the inflamed Body with the Smoak, finds no place to receive it. For then the fire ceaſes to be moved in the fume or Smoak. For ſeeing, as was ſaid before, two bodies cannot be in the ſame place,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> leaſt there ſhould be a penetration of dimenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and in the inflamation, of mixt Bodies,
<note place="margin">Either by ſuffocation.</note> many exhalations go away with the Fire which fire which raiſed them; if they find no place to receive them, their eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration together with the flame is hindred, by the neceſſary working of univerſal Nature. After this manner, all things that deny place to the Fire and the exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion joyned therewith, do extinguiſh the fire, and ſtifle the ſame: which happens when the flame and fume are ſo ſhut up, that they have no free egreſs, nor place to hold them.</p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:35070:49"/>
                  <p> Its alſo a kind of ſuffocation,
<note place="margin">Hereunto belongs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo extincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by thick Air.</note> when the flame is extinguiſhed by thick Air and exhalations; which comes to paſs in the quarries of metals, the pumpes of Ships, and when Beer and new Wine works. For ſeeing the Air is then filled with thick vapors, it cannot contain the flame with its exhalation, whence its motion muſt needs be ſtopped and choaked in its Root.</p>
                  <p>To ſuffocation alſo,
<note place="margin">Alſo the compreſſi on of the Wiek.</note> compreſſion may be referred, when the wiek being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, the flame of Candles is put out unleſs any one will refer this to the follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing manner, whereby fire is violently ſeparated from its Fuel and Root as it were.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A flame is extinguiſhed by diſcuſſion and diſſipation, when the flame is pluckt away and ſo departs from its fuel and Root,
<note place="margin">Or by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion and diſſipation</note> before new fire can follow, and when the fire is taken away, which drew out the fire in the mixt body. After this manner Torches are blown out by Winds, and we blow out Candles and Lamps with our Breath.
<note place="margin">Why flame is both rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, by blowing</note> And ſeeing by the blaſt of ones Mouth or by Bellows, flame is raiſed, and the fire in Coals turns to a flame, we muſt enquire the cauſe of theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent effects. Where we are to know; if a little flame do only ſtick in the ſurface of the Body, it is ſoon extinguiſhed by blowing, whereby the incendiary, and the fire into which the mixt Body is reſolved, are ſoon taken away. But if the fire, actuated by blowing, is driven into the inner parts of the Body inflameable the fire is more and more encreaſed. Thus, by blaſt of the Mou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h, and of the Bellows, the fire is droven into the inner part of the Coals, and flame is raiſed, which when it hath taken deep root, it is not eaſily ſeparated, but the fire deſirous to preſerve it ſelf, alwaies goes more inward, and by that motion, more of the hidden fire is actuated. Which is manifeſt in Coals. Hence it appears, why as <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> ſaies and experience teaches, Lamps do conſume more Oyl, if the Wind blow upon them, then they do when the Air is ſtil, and torches alſo are ſooner burnt out, when the wind blows. For ſeeing the flame is prepetually generated, and the Wind or other blaſt diſcuſſes the flame gennerated, the fire ſticking cloſe to its principle or Root, does more greedily and powerfully draw out what ever is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in inflamable, and turnes it into flame.</p>
                  <p>Hence alſo a cauſe may be rendred,
<note place="margin">When and why the flame in the wiek, is extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed &amp; blown in again.</note> why the flame being extinguiſhed, is again excited by blowing upon the ſnuf. Where you muſt obſerve that this does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies happen, but ſomtimes only, when the ſnuf is large and ful of fire, like a coal. For then, as burning coals by the blaſt of bellows, do ſend forth a flame which otherwiſe, of themſelves they would not do: ſo alſo the fire being in great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity in the ſnuf, by blowing conceives flame. But if the ſnuf after the flame is blown out, have not much fire in it, and be not red hot, 'twil be in vaine to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to blow it into a flame,</p>
                  <p>This alſo is to be obſerved by the Way:
<note place="margin">Why the fire of a flame, is more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer fulhen that of burning coals.</note> that the fire of a flame, is much more vehement then that of Coals, and that not without Cauſe. For all the ſtrength of Fire is in motion. And experience it ſelf witneſſes the ſame. And therefore Gold-Smiths do moſt readily melt their Gold by a Lamp, the flame whereof they direct upon the Gold by blowing. And others alſo that work in metal, and amongſt them, belfounders do rather uſe the fire of flame riſing from wood, then Coals, and if in other melting fornaces they uſe Coals, they uſe the continual blaſt of bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows to make them flame.</p>
                  <p>There is yet a third way,
<note place="margin">Or by bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the afflux of new fire.</note> when the flame, though the matter of fire be preſent in an inflameable body, is extinguiſhed, becauſe that which is firſt bred, flies away; ſeeing flame is in perpetual motion, and new fire is hindred from coming out of the inflameable body, or the actual fire is hindred from drawing more out of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flameable body, or as <hi>Theopraſtus</hi> ſpeaks ſomwhat ſhuts up and ſtops the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
<note place="margin">Whether ſire be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, by preſence of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</note> Which how it comes to paſs, we are now to enquire. which how it comes to paſs, muſt be enquired unto. Some men may refer this to the preſence of that which is contrary, which when the fire perceives, it flies from it, and ceaſes its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But, Seeing not only water, but alſo Oyl and ſpirit of wine, too abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poured about the flame, yea, and Aſhes, Sand, and what ever covers the inflame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able body, that the Flame which cals out the lurking fire, cannot touch the ſame, puts out the flame; and 'tis not only contrarity that makes to the extinction of the flame. For the fire in the flame flies away, when it can no longer touch the Body inflamed. And though the Body, which interpoſes it ſelf, be it ſelf alſo inflame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:35070:49"/>Yet, If either by means of the great Quantity thereof, or by reaſon of the admiſtion of another Body, it cannot ſet that body on fire, nor change it into a flame to ſucced, the former flame flies away, and ſo no other coming in its place, the fire is extinguiſhed. Yet, becauſe of al things water doth moſt eaſily extinguiſh fire; if any one wil have it, that it puts out fire, not only by interpoſition of its bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but alſo by its contrariety which it hath to Fire, I ſhal not contend with him thereabout.</p>
                  <p>But how it comes to paſs that ſome fire burns under water,
<note place="margin">Why ſome fire burns under the Water.</note> is an obſcure queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor that I know of, ſufficiently explained by any Man. For al inflameable things wil not burn under the Water. For Rozin, Bitumen, Frankincenſe, Yea, and Brim-Stone it ſelf, if being ſet on fire they be put into water, they are eaſily extinguiſhed: and other things even when they are not on fire wil not admit of water, as Oyls, Tallows, Fats. And if theſe be much heated, and then water poured upon them, there ariſes a great ſight betwixt them and the Water, and the fire flies violently away with a great noiſe; ſo that experience hath taught, that fires have been cauſed by pouring Water on ſuch fat things when they boil. If therefore mixtures be made of ſuch things ſo fatty, which exceedingly reſiſt water, adding ſuch things as do moſt of all cheriſh fire, and keep it from flying away, then thoſe mixtures will burn even in the Water. For a part of ſuch a mixture being inflamed, does vehemently drive the Water from it ſelf, and therefore ſuch things burn with a noiſe, and hinder the water from piercing into the burning body, and the other things do continually ſupply matter to the flame.</p>
                  <p>A Torch that wil not be extinguiſhed by Rain or Wind, may thus be made.
<note place="margin">A Torch that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be quenched.</note> Take <hi>Colophony and Wax of each ſix pound, Turpentine two pound, Tallow one pound.</hi> Mix all over the fire. And in this mixture dip Wieks to make Candles, or Cords to make links, let them boil a little and then take them out and cool, and wreath four together for one link. Which muſt be covered with <hi>four pound of Wax and one pound of Turpentine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Candle that will burn in water may thus be made. Take <hi>Wax half a pound,
<note place="margin">A Candle that will burne in water.</note> Brim-ſtone, unſlak't Lime, Turpentine, Salt Ammoniack, of each two ounces, Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leum one ounce, Camphire half an ounce.</hi> Mix them and make thereof Candles, which if they be lighted and thrown into the water will burn never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the manners and waies already reckoned up,
<note place="margin">Flame is alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed when a greater is applied to a leſſer.</note> whereby fire may be exting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhed, <hi>Theophraſtus,</hi> in his <hi>B. de Igne,</hi> hath yet another, <hi>viz.</hi> When a greater fire is put to a leſſer. So we ſee, a great Candle lighted and put to a leſſer, puts the leſſer out. But then the leſſer flame indeed is extinguiſhed, but the fire in the Snuf is not put out: and the ſire and flame do not go away, only the leſſer flame goes to the greater, becauſe of affinity, and is thereto joyned; or the leſſer flame is drawn to it by the greater.</p>
                  <p>And that we may ſay ſomwhat alſo of the effects and operations of fire;
<note place="margin">Of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of fire.</note> Fire is indeed eſſentially one and the ſame, but according to the diverſity of the matter wherein it is, it workes diverſly. <hi>Fire is moſt hot in a ſolid and Earthy Body,</hi> ſaies <hi>Theophraſtus:</hi> but in a thin and rare or ſpungy body, 'tis leſs hot. And <hi>Scaliger</hi> in his 9. <hi>Exercitation: Fire in Iron is moſt vehement by reaſon of its denſity,
<note place="margin">Why ſome fire is more vehement then other ſome?</note> in wood leſs vehement, weaker in Wooll and ſuch Paper as we uſe; in a flame it is ſo dilute that we can draw our hand through it without hurt; in Aquae-vitae, on fire the flame is ſo thin, that it will not burn a cloath dipt therein.</hi> Yea, And the ſame <hi>Scaliger</hi> in the ſame place ſaies, that the fire burns not of it ſelf, but by accident, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſation. Howbeit, It is a queſtion obſcure enough, whether fire of it ſelf burns, and whether ſome fire be hotter then otherſome. <hi>Cardan</hi> hath invented ſome cauſes of this thing, which may be ſeen in <hi>Scaliger.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Andreas Libavius</hi> indeed oppoſes this opinion of <hi>Scaliger</hi> in his <hi>Comm. Alchym.
<note place="margin">Libavius <hi>oppoſes the opinion of</hi> Scaliger.</note> Part.</hi> 1. <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 12. And feigns I know not what intenſion of ſubſtances and qualities, and objects divers things of little validity againſt him, ſcarce rightly ſtating the Controverſie. For firſt he ſaies, when ſtubble is looſe and ſpred abroad,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:35070:50"/>the fire Flams and wanders at large, and we muſt ſay its heat is leſs becauſe of the diſperſion of parts. Take them therefore in your hand, twiſt them and twind them together, yet the fire becomes no ſtronger: but the anſwer is eaſie. The ſtubble it ſelf, whether ſpread abroad, or in a bund<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>, does not change its Nature, but continues ſpungy. And therefore it ſtirs up the ſame degree of fire, ſave that when it lies ſcattered it cannot afford ſo joynt a Flame, ſeeing much Air comes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween, as when it is gathered together. Again, he ſaies, that fire burning freely in a ſpungy piece of Wood hath more furtherances to its action, then in an hard and ſolid, although you imagine both of them to be totally inflamed. The fire of looſe Coals is more ſpirituous, and more blown through then that of hard Coals, although a greater impreſſion ſeems to be made by the latter, if you touch them: yet it hath leſs ſpirit, it receives leſs nutriment from the Air; and becauſe it is more ſhut in, it is more weak, though more laſting in regard of the ſtrength of the matter.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Libavius</hi> ſeems,
<note place="margin">Libavius <hi>his objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</hi>
                     </note> not to have been well acquainted with the Nature of fire, and there are many things in theſe objections not agreeing with truth, alſo ſeveral queſtions are mingled together. For the queſtion is not, what material does more eaſily take fire, and in which fire is moſt eaſily brought into act, and which burns moſt freely. For we grant that al theſe things are true of Spungy bodies. But the queſtion is, in which the fire burns moſt, in a rare or a denſe body. And we ſay, that fire does burn more vehemently in a compact and denſe body, as experience ſhews. For a man may without dammage draw his finger through the flame, but if he do but touch a red hot Iron, he is burnt in a moment. Which <hi>Libavius</hi> himſelf confeſſeth when he grants, that we perceive a greater heat in hard Coals then in ſpun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, if we touch them. Now that is falſe, that the fire receives nouriſhment from the Air, ſince whatſoever is lighted muſt be in the inflamed body. But if fire be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laied with much Air, as happens in the burning of ſtubble and ſuch like things, the fire is not thereby made ſtronger but weaker. And <hi>Libavius</hi> confounds the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the ſiery parts and the ſtronger action of the fire depending thereupon, with the intenſion of the heat it ſelf. That one fire is greater then another is out of queſtion; and manifeſt alſo it is, that in a greater Quantity the power of acting is greater, in a leſs quantity leſſer. For that metal which is melted by a large flame of Wood or Coals, will not be melted by the flame of a Candle. But here lies the Queſtion, whether the heat and fire which is in a great flame, be of it ſelf more intenſe then that in a ſmal one. Which <hi>Scaliger</hi> denies, for the cauſes aforeſaid, and maintaines, that thoſe parts of fire, which they call degrees, are augmented by conjunction of parts, and not by intenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Virtue. Which opinion of <hi>Scaliger,</hi> though <hi>Libavius</hi> call's it a Nicety; Yet, He muſt needs allow of it, when he writes that the heat of Fire is as great as may be, in the ſmalleſt ſpark, and of it ſelf ſuffers nothing to be taken from it, nor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits any part of a cold body into its ſociety. And though he addes that the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſubject of them both is altered; yet will not <hi>Scaliger</hi> deny this neither. For by how much the more Fire there is in any body, ſo much the hotter is it; and by how much the leſſer, ſo much the leſs hot. Take for an example (which <hi>Libavius</hi> himſelf uſes) ſeething Water. There is in boyling hot Water much Fire, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon if you pour cold water, it becomes luke-warm, becauſe of the admixture of cold water, which hath no Fire in it. In a ſmal piece of Iron there may be more Fire, then in a great deal of ſtubble.</p>
                  <p>I retain therefore the opinion of <hi>Scaliger,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> and hold, that one Fire is not hotter then another; but that Fire burns more ſtrongly then Fire, comes by reaſon of the union of many parts; and that fire burns weakly, proceeds from the diſtance of the ſaid parts. Which that we may underſtand more clearly, we muſt know, that Fire is moſt of all allayed by Air, which eaſily inſinuates it ſelf into the ſociety thereof. Whence it follows, that in rare and porous Bodies, which containe much Air in them, Fire is more weak and dilute, and its parts are not too near. Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, In ſolid bodies, into which Fire pierceth where there is little Air, the parts of the Fire do ſtick more one to another, and are compacted.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit from the premiſes it follows,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Fire burns of it ſelf and not by accident, as</hi> Scaliger <hi>Imagines.</hi>
                     </note> that fire burns of it ſelf, not by accident as <hi>Scaliger</hi> would have it; contrariwiſe that it does not burn by accident at al. For, ſeeing Fire of it ſelf is the hotteſt of all bodies (though we have no ſuch Fire with us, that is pure) and in pure Fire there is a great cleaving together of the parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:35070:50"/>it muſt alſo of neceſſity burn: which alſo it does in Iron, and other red-hot me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, becauſe the Atomes or indiviſible particles of the fire do Cohere together, and are extreamly near one another, and very many are contained in a ſmal place, and becauſe of their conjunction they act more effectually. Contrariwiſe in ſtubble, and other ſpungy Bodies, becauſe Air is mixed with the flame; and as <hi>Scaliger</hi> in his 9 <hi>Exercitation</hi> ſpeaks, the fire is allayed by the Air, the parts of the fire do not ſtick together, but are at diſtance, the Air coming between, therefore they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not act ſo ſtrongly. For Fire truly is the firſt ſubject of heat, and the hotteſt thing of all others: but that it does not allwaies Act to extremity, comes by admixture of other Bodies not ſo hot, eſpecially of the Air.</p>
                  <p>The next Element to fire is the Air. For it,
<note place="margin">
                        <p>What place the Air holds.</p>
                        <p>Its three Regions.</p>
                     </note> as it declines from the carity and heat of the Fir; ſo it takes up a room a little more remote from Heaven, and is heavy reſpectively. The Air is divided into three Regions: the uppermoſt, the middlemoſt, and the lowermoſt. The <hi>uppermoſt</hi> is above the Tops of the higheſt mountaines. For imagine but a ſurface upon the tops of the Higheſt mountaines, that ſhall make the Earth exactly round, the Air above the ſame, to the Sphere of fire is the uppermoſt Region. The other are below this, which are not allwaies of a like bigneſs. For in Summer the loweſt is greateſt, which reaches as far as the reflection of the Sun beams goes; and in Winter the middle Region. For in ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer time when the Sun beams fal to righter Angles, they are reflected higher; but in Winter, the Beams of the Sun being very oblique are reflected ſidewaies; nor do they rebound aloft. The middle Region, in reſpect of the two others is leaſt hot, and therefore it is ſaid to be cold, becauſe the Sun beams are not reflected ſo far: the other two are hotter; the uppermoſt, becauſe of the Vicinity of the Heaven and the ſiery Element; the loweſt be cauſe of the doubled Sun beams, direct and reflex.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit the loweſt Region is variouſly diſpoſed, ſomtimes 'tis hot, otherwhiles cold, ſomtimes moiſt, otherwhiles dry, ſomtimes clear, otherwhiles cloudy; and the Air being in this Region variouſly diſpoſed, does diverſly affect our Bodies. For while we breathe, we continually draw it in, and by it the ſpirits in our Bodies are repaired and cheriſhed, and our heat which in the Body needs continual fanning, is thereby preſerved.</p>
                  <p>After the Air comes the <hi>Water,</hi> an heavy Element,
<note place="margin">The Water.</note> yet ſomwhat lighter then the Earth. This Element is no where found pure, but is every where mixed with the Earth and ambient Air; of which the taſte is an argument, ſeeing you can hardly ſinde any Water void of taſte.</p>
                  <p>The loweſt place is taken up by the Earth,
<note place="margin">The Earth.</note> which is of all Elements the moſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, and moſt unfit for motion. It hath much matter, and is therefore thick and dark. The Earth is not found pure on the top thereof, but if it be any where pure, it is in the Centre, whither no contrary does pierce, that may corrupt it.</p>
                  <p>The Water and Earth do not make a peculiar Sphere as the reſt of the Elements,
<note place="margin">The Water and the Earth do not make a peculiar ſphere.</note> nor does the water compaſs the Earth on all ſides, but the Earth receives the water within its Cavities; and in very many places, by a ſingular providence of God, the Earth ſtands bare, for the more commodious generation and nutrition of Animals and other mixt Bodies, and it lies open to receive the Raies of the Stars. For Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and Commodity overcame the force of neceſſity, in reſpect whereof, the water was to have covered the whole Earth. As <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaies, in his 9. <hi>Exercita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, How great the Earth and Water is can hardly be determined. That the compaſs of the whole Globe made up of Earth and water is 18000. furlongs, or 5400 German miles, and the Diameter thereof about 1718. German miles, is a thing out of queſtion: but 'tis hard to ſay whether there be more Earth or Water: Yet moſt likely it is, that there is more Earth then Water. For neither is the greater part of the ſurface of the Globe of the Earth covered with Water, as appears by the true deſcription of the ſaid Globe: nor indeed is the quantity of the Water greater then that of the Earth; ſeeing by the ſounding Plummet we diſcern that there is Earth under the Sea; and the depth of the Sea compared with the diameter of the Earth, is a thing of ſmal moment. Of which ſee <hi>Alexander Piccolhomineus</hi> in his <hi>Treatiſe of the Largneſs of the Land and Water.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:35070:51"/>
                  <p> And,
<note place="margin">The water with the Earth makes one Globe.</note> that the Sea is not flat and even, but that it makes one Globe with the Earth, is proved, firſt by Eclipſes of the Moon, in which the ſhadow of the Earth appears circular; and therefore argues the Body of the Earth to be ſo likewiſe; and in the next place by Navigations: For if a man ſail out into the main Sea, and take notice of ſome Houſe or turret on the ſhore, at firſt he ſees it all, afterward, ſcarce half, til at laſt he quite loſe the ſight of it, becauſe the ſwelling roundneſs of the Water interpoſes it ſelf between the ſhore and the mans Eye; for ſight goes alwaies in a right Line. And although the Earth it ſelf be not an exact Globe, but a Globous Body, high in ſome places, low in other ſome: yet this highneſs and flatneſs bears ſcarce any proportion to the whole Body of the Earth; which appears by Eclipſes of the Moon, wherein the ſhadow of the Earth appears Circular, and makes a Circular Line.</p>

                     </gap> we ſee things overdried do breale: and from drineſs things have ſtability and Conſiſtency.</p>
                  <p>Now touching theſe definitions, this is to be obſerved: that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the firſt Qualities abſolutely conſidered, as they are in the Elementy, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as ſimple bodies and not compounded into mixt things; but as they appertain unto them, when they go into a mixt body. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was not indeed ignorant, that the firſt Qualities had other effects preceding thoſe by which he defined them; and that an Hot thing Heats, a Cold, Cools; a Moiſt moiſtens, and a Dry Dries; yet he thought not fit to conſtitute or make up the definitions of the firſt Qualities by theſe effects; both becauſe theſe definitions would reveal nothing that was hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:35070:52"/>but the ſame thing would be defined by the ſame; and alſo becauſe the firſt qualities are given to the Elements by Nature, for no other occaſion but that by them as the immediate inſtruments they might be the principles of mixt bodies. And the firſt operations of the firſt qualities are originally more principal than the ſecond operations of the ſaid Qualities: but in the intent of nature contriving the generation of a mixt body, they are not the principal, but the ſecond are more principal than they. Wherefore, omitting thoſe common operations known of themſelves, which they perform both in mixt and ſimple bodies, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> would define them by thoſe alone which they exerciſe in mixt bodies.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Qualities are divided into <hi>Active</hi> Heat and Cold;
<note place="margin">Whether the firſt Qualities are rightly divided into active and paſſive</note> and <hi>Paſſive</hi> Moiſture and Drineſs, of which diviſion, although the opinions of Authors are various, as may be ſeen in <hi>Archangelus Mercenarius, p.</hi> 239. <hi>Zabarella de Qual. Elem. c.</hi> 5. <hi>Franc. Piccol. de Qual. p.</hi> 1. <hi>cap</hi> 8. yet I conceive, this ought to be our judgment. All theſe qualities, in reſpect of that univocal action, whereby each one by its firſt operations begets its like, and deſtoies its contrary, as wel in ſimples as in mixt bodies, do both act and ſuffer: yet in reſpect of their equivocal action, which they only exerciſe in mixt bodies, and whereby they produce the ſecond qualities, and the nature of the mixt body it ſelf, different from the nature of the Elements; two are termed active, and two paſſive. And in this reſpect, Moiſture and Drineſs have no active power, but are only as matter which the Work-maſters Heat and Cold exerciſe their craft upon.</p>
                  <p>Seeing theſe Qualities are in the Elements as in their firſt ſubjects, we may right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by them ſearch out alſo the number of the Elements. And omitting that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which was produced in the ſecond Book foregoing, we ſhall thus proceed. If the Elements be alterable, they muſt needs be more than one: but they are altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for they muſt be the principles of alterable bodies, and bodies that are corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Therefore there cannot be one Element but many, and they endowed with contrary qualities, by which they act and ſuffer mutually. This reaſon agrees with that of <hi>Hippocrates, Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>de Nat. Hom. t.</hi> 5. where he ſaies: if a Man conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted only of one Element, he ſhould never be pained: for there would be nothing to pain him, becauſe he ſhould be one thing; and, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaies in his Comment, there would be no ſecond to act upon him. For the ſelf ſame body cannot ſuffer from it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Now how many Elements there are,
<note place="margin">The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Elements.</note> 
                     <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> demonſtrates <hi>in his</hi> 2. <hi>de Gener. &amp; Corrup. cap.</hi> 3. <hi>t.</hi> 16. and <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>t.</hi> 34. after this manner. The Elements are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called the principles of mixt bodies, becauſe being altered and changed one by another, they conſtitute the ſaid bodies. Now all alteration and mutation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the action and paſſion of the firſt Qualities, which are four as was ſaid before. Thoſe ſimple bodies therefore which are the ſubject of the firſt Qualities, ſhal be the principles of mixt bodies. And that they may rightly cauſe miſtion, 'tis neceſſary,
<note place="margin">Whether the firſt Qualities be the forms of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> that each may ſuffer from each, and that therefore it have not only one, but two firſt Qualities.</p>
                  <p>From the Premiſes therefore, thus we conclude. There are ſo many Elements, as there are poſſible combinations of the firſt Qualities: but they are only four; Heat and Drineſs; Cold and Moiſture; Heat and moiſture, Cold and Drineſs: for the other two are altogether impoſſible, nor can extream Heat combine with extream Cold, nor extream Drineſs with extream Moiſture: ſeeing contraries cannot be in one and the ſame ſubject. So many Elements therefore there are; The Fire hot and dry; the Air, hot and moiſt; The Water, cold and moiſt; and the Earth, cold and dry.</p>
                  <p>Hereunto may alſo be added another reaſon, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> uſes in his 2. <hi>de Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerat. and Corrupt. Cap.</hi> 8. <hi>T.</hi> 40. So many Elements there are, as there are things of which perfectly mixt Bodies do conſiſt. But they conſiſt only of four: and therefore there are four Elements. For we ſee all perfectly mixt Bodies to have much Earth in them, and to be moved towards the Earth: but mixt Bodies are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved according to the motion of the prevalent Element. And mixt Bodies becauſe they are knit together and Co-here, and receive terms, there is alſo water in them, for it is the part of Water to unite and faſten: if Water and Earth, then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Elements Fire and Air, by which they are to be allaied, and wherewith to be mingled. For mixture is not made without mutual action and paſſion. Moreover
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:35070:52"/>all Generation is made by Heat. And therefore beſides water and Earth, heat alſo is required to mixture: but one hot Element doth not ſuffice: For it would be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed by two cold ones. And therefore, beſides Water and Earth, Fire alſo and Air do concur to conſtitute all mixt Bodies.</p>
                  <p>The number of the Elements being found out,
<note place="margin">Whether the firſt qualities be the forms of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> we muſt now enquire into their Eſſence and Nature. And ſince the firſt qualities are very intimate to the Elements, the queſtion is; <hi>Whether the firſt Qualities are the ſubſtantial forms of the Elements?</hi> Or whether the Elements have other forms beſides the Qualities. Not to be prolix in a plain caſe, briefly thus we hold; that the firſt qualities are not the ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al forms of the Elements, but accidents. A token whereof is, that the firſt qualities are perceived by the ſenſe; whereas no ſubſtance can of it ſelf be perceived by the ſenſe; again they are found in other things as mutable accidents; and therefore in the Elements themſelves they cannot any waies be ſubſtances. Howbeit the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Forms of the Elements are by them Circumſcribed by Authors. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Hippocrates</hi> himſelf, oft calls the four Elements by the Names of Hot, Cold, Moiſt and Dry, as <hi>Galen</hi> witneſſes in his 1. <hi>De Temp. Ch.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>By the Qualities therefore the Elements are known to us.
<note place="margin">The quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Forms.</note> For they are in the Elements as their Proper ſubjects, from whoſe forms alſo they depend and have their being. For I hold not with thoſe who deny, that the firſt Qualities which are in the Elements do proceed from the forms of the ſaid Elements, by way of Emanation, but derive them all from the motion of Heaven, or the Negation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. For 'tis an abſurd thing, that a Natural Quality ſhould proceed from any thing but its own Form. Nor muſt we think that the forms of the Elements are Lazy and Heartleſs, and produce no Qualities, nor work no operations. For if the firſt proceed not from the forms, which are moſt intimate with the Elements; I do not ſee what other Qualities can proceed from them: moreover an abſurd thing it is, to hold that cold comes only from the Privation of the motion of Heaven: for ſince it is a poſitive Quality, it requires alſo a poſitive Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>in each Element there are two Qualities.</hi> For ſeeing it is neceſſary,
<note place="margin">Each Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath two quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> That every Element, for the more commodious generation of things and their mixtion, ſhould be able to act upon every one, and ſuffer from every one: therefore each have two qualities. Now the Queſtion in this place is; whether both Qualities do equally agree to each Element?
<note place="margin">Whether each Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath one quality in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree?</note> 
                     <hi>Or whether one Element have affinity to one Quality more then another, and have one Quality primarily, the other ſecondarily:</hi> Moreover; <hi>Whether in each Element both the Qualities are in the higheſt degree,</hi> Or one only in the higheſt degree, and the other remiſs: and it is diſputed, how that place in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> 2. <hi>de Gener. and Corrup. Cap.</hi> 3. <hi>T.</hi> 23. is to be underſtood; where <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> thus ſaies: <hi>The Earth is dry more then cold, the Water cold more then moiſt, the Air moiſt more then hot, the fire hot more then dry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Twere long to recount the different opinions of Authors touching this Queſtion, and to make any certain determination is hard: yet I ſhall briefly propound what I conceive moſt probable. Now we hold, that that one quality is moſt intimate to the Nature of each Element and more of alliance thereto then the other: alſo that one is more excellent, the other leſs excellent, <hi>viz.</hi> That the fire, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath it in the place forealleadged, is moſt Hot and Dry; the Air moſt moiſt and hot: the Water moſt cold and moiſt; the Earth moſt Dry and Cold; which alſo ſenſe does teſtifie: and that theſe Qualities do after this manner flow from the form of each Element. And they are in an Error, who while they are ſollicitous about attributing to each Element its own Qualities, do not ſo much regard the forms of the Elements, as their greater or leſſer diſtance from Heaven, and think thence to fetch the qualities. Nor is that of any great moment, which hath moved many to think the contrary: <hi>viz.</hi> That the abatement of the quality is cauſed by its contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; whereas the Elements are moſt ſimple, and have no contrariety in them. For this is true only of mixt bodies, but not of ſimple Elements: and that conſtitution of Qualities doth proceed from the form of each one. For as this is the Nature of the Air, that without the mixture of any heavy Body it is not ſo light as the fire; ſo it is a property thereof, not to be ſo hot as fire.</p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:35070:53"/>
                  <p> And here is alſo another Queſtion,
<note place="margin">Whether the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, are of ſeveral ſorts.</note> whether <hi>ſymbolical Qualities,</hi> for example ſake the Heat in the Fire and the Heat in the Air, are of the ſame ſort. Now the Anſwer is, That theſe Qualities are not of ſeveral ſorts, and that we are not to acknowledg eight, but only four firſt Qualities, which in the firſt place our Senſe it ſelf doth witneſs, which judgeth all heat to be of one ſort: and again when the ſymbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Elements are changed, the Quality wherein they partake abides: and the watry coldneſs it ſelf is as contrary to the heat of the Air, as to the heat of the Fire.</p>
                  <p>From what has been ſaid may eaſily be collected, what is the nature of each Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For the <hi>Fire</hi> is an <hi>Element exceedingly and primarily hot,</hi> and <hi>Dry.</hi> Both which experience does witneſs, wherby we are all dayly inſtructed that Fire is dry. For Fire can change both Air and Water. And therfore it muſt have Qualities con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to them. For tranſmutation happens betwixt contraries: and whereas both the Air and Water are moiſt, the Fire contrariwiſe is dry.</p>
                  <p>We muſt therefore reject the Paradoxical opinion of <hi>Johannes Baptiſta Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> who teaches that the Fire and all Elements have ſome moiſture in them, and that whatever is continued in Nature and united, whether it be ſimple or compound, is continued only by humidity, and that not only in this ſublunary world, but in the Heaven alſo. For in mixture only it is, that divers ſimple bodies are coupled by moiſture: not ſimple bodies, for ſo they ſhould not be ſimple. But the form of every ſimple body, as it gives the being and bounds, ſo it couples and contains the parts.</p>
                  <p>The Fire therefore, ſeeing it is Primarily and principally hot, al hot operations are therefore therein more conſpicuous:
<note place="margin">The Fire compared to a King.</note> and therfore it is neatly by <hi>Scaliger</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a juſt King, which renders every one his due, dividing the Land amongſt families: and to a prudent ſteward of an houſe that reſerves to himſelf as much as he needs. For out of Wood, it gives aſhes to the Earth, liquor to the water, vapor to the Air; and takes that to it ſelf which is concealed from the Eies of the Vulgar, but not from the mind of the Wiſe. And although very many in this age ſeek to baniſh Fire out of the Univerſe: yet I conceive we ought not to reject the ſame, as hath been ſaid before in <hi>B.</hi> 2. <hi>ch.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Air is an Element in the higheſt degree and primarily moiſt.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Air is moſt moiſt and hot. The Air is hot.</note> Now touching the heat thereof, there is great difference amongſt Authors. For the Stoicks as <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, Nat. Queſt. Book</hi> 2. <hi>Ch.</hi> 10. Cardan <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Elem.</hi> and others do hold againſt the Peripateticks that the Air is cold. But I muſt take part with the Peripateticks for the heat of the Air; ſeeing there are ſtrong reaſons to back that opinion For Air is produced and preſerved by that which is hot: but is condenſed by cold, and turned into water. Moreover the lightneſs of the Air is a token of its Heat, feeing Lightneſs follows after or accompanies Heat. Moreover, if the Air were cold, there would be no ſimple body hot and moiſt, and water ſhould agree with Air, and therefore one of the two would be ſuperfluous. More reaſons are to be found in Authors to this purpoſe. But all which is ſaid of Air in this caſe muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of it, as it is a pure Element. For being mingled with vapors, and affected with a ſtrange quality, it hath oft-times a faculty of cooling, and oft-times of drying, which nevertheleſs agrees not thereto of it ſelf, but by accident.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Water is an Element in the higheſt degree and primarily cold,
<note place="margin">Water is an Element moſt cold, and moiſt. Earth an Element moſt dry and cold.</note> and moiſt: the Earth in the higheſt degree and primarily dry, alſo cold.</hi> Concerning theſe two Elements few Controverſies are ſtarted. For whereas ſome diſpute, whether the Earth or the water is primarily cold, the queſtion may eaſily be determined, from what hath been ſaid. For they which would have the Earth colder than the Water build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a bad foundation: <hi>viz.</hi> that all the Elementary Qualities proceed from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which was before rejected. <hi>And ſo much for the Elements.</hi>

Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. <hi>t.</hi> 43. we muſt firſt ſpeak a little concerning Contact or mutual touching, Action, paſſion and Reaction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Contact</hi> is chiefly twofold: one improperly ſo called, which they term virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; whereby things incorporeal do act upon other things, or a diſtant body, doth by its Virtue work upon another remote body. The other is a Contact of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudes; of which there are again many faſhions. For abſolutely and generally al things are ſaid to touch, which having diſtinct magnitude and poſition have their extream parts cloſe one to another. And then there is a Phyſical or Natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact, of which we are now treating; and this belongs to bodies having divers mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudes, whoſe extream parts are together: and which act and ſuffer one upon and from another. Or in a word: Thoſe bodies touch with a Phyſical contact, whoſe bounds are together, and which mutually act and ſuffer one upon and from another. For beſides theſe things which are common to all bodies that are ſaid to touch one another, <hi>viz.</hi> to have magnitudes diſtinct, a certain poſition of parts their place and extream parts together; this is peculiar to Phyſical contact, that bodies which do thereby touch one another, do act upon and ſuffer from one another. Thirdly, Thoſe bodies do touch one another, whoſe extream parts are together, and one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acts upon another, but ſuffers nothing therefrom.</p>
                  <p>Contact is therefore required as a neceſſary condition in ſublunary things. For it hath been before proved in general, that every Agent muſt be together with the Patient. For ſince by the Agents action upon the Patient, ſome mutation ought to be made, of neceſſity that muſt be preſent which changes, or at leaſt its Virtue; and its Virtue cannot be preſent, unleſs that be preſent which carries it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in every action the Patient is toucht by the Agent, or at leaſt by that which carries its Virtue. For nothing acts upon the extream, but it acts firſt upon the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium.</p>
                  <p>Yet we muſt here diligently obſerve; that there is a double action, the one pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, which immediately follows the nature of the thing; the other ſecondary proceeding from the primary. The primary action of the Sun is Illumination: the ſecondary Heating. The primary action of the Fire is to heat; the ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to melt, to harden. Now touching the primary 'tis only true, that the Agent acts not upon the extream, before it act upon the Intermedium. For the ſecond Action, beſides <hi>that</hi> that it preſuppoſes the firſt, alſo it requires an aptitude of the ſubject to ſuffer; whence that vulgar aſſertion in the Phyloſophck Schools, The actions of Active things, are received in a Patient and that which is diſpoſed alſo, Whatever is received is received according to the diſpoſition of the Receiver. So by the Sun light is produced, both in the Aethereal and Elementary world; but the Heat not in Heaven, but only in ſublunary things. So Fire heats both Wax and Clay; yet it melts the former and hardens the latter: becauſe the former is indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be hard, and the latter is indiſpoſed to melt.</p>
                  <p>With the Mutual contact of the Elements is conjoyned their Action and paſſion. Now by action we do not here underſtand every action, but that only which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the firſt qualities, Now among what things there might be Action, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients were not agreed, as may be ſeen in <hi>Ariſtotle, de Generat. &amp; Corrupt. Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 7. <hi>T.</hi> 46, 47. For ſome held, that all action and paſſion was betwixt things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like; others, that a thing did not ſuffer from a thing unlike, but only from its like. We with <hi>Ariſtotle, in the place aforeſaid, Text</hi> 50. do hold the middle opinion, and do ſay: that every agent endeavours to make the patient like it ſelf, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a thing like as it is like, and according to the ſame quality whereby it is like, does not act upon its like: for examples ſake, that which is cold, as it is cold, does
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:35070:54"/>not act upon a cold thing: nor does that which is diverſe, act upon that which is altogether diverſe; for Heat does not act upon heat: but contrary acts upon its contrary. And therefore thoſe things which act one upon another, and ſuffer one from another, are partly like and partly unlike; like in Kind, but unlike in ſort; for contraries are under the ſame kind, but differ in the ſort.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit, What hath been ſaid, that like does not act upon its like, muſt be a little more diligently weighed: becauſe from the right underſtanding of this Axiom, we come to the knowledg of many things in Natural Philoſophy and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick. In the firſt place it muſt be obſerved, that in this place, we ſpeak of that ſimilitude which is betwixt the firſt qualities; and in the next place that this ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude is three-fold. For ſome things are alike, only according to the ſort of quality; although in the degree, or the intention of the quality and vehemency of the action, which they cal activity, they are unlike. So every hot thing is ſaid to be like another hot thing, and fire is ſaid to be like lukewarm Water, and other things any waies hot. Other things are alike, both in the ſort and the degree of the quality, although they differ in the vehemency of their action: thus the ſire in a red hot Iron, is like that in burning wood. Other things are a like, both accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſort of the quality, and according to the degree thereof, and according to the power of acting. So two fires, which are in matters of the ſame bigneſs, and of the ſame rarity or denſity are alike. For this muſt not be forgotten; that equal activity does not alwaies proceed from the ſame degree of quality; nor hath every heat which is alike in degree and intenſion, an equal faculty of heating, but often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times where there is no exceſs of degree, there is yet an exceſs of operation, either by reaſon of the plenty of matter, or the denſity thereof. For the fire which is made of a great Faggot, is not hotter or more intenſe then that which is made of a ſtick or two; but only hath a greater activity; and a dram of Pepper is not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the degree of heat more intenſe, then one Pepper Corn: but only hath a greater power to act. For in a greater magnitude there is more virtue: and in much matter, much form. So the fire in a red hot Iron, is not hotter then that in ſtubble: but it hath a greater ſtrength to act. For force united is more ſtrong then that which is diſperſed: and an agent the nearer it is to the Patient, the more it acts thereupon. Now the parts of a compact body are leſs diſtant from any particular point in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rient, then the parts of the ſame Body rarified, and extended to a greater bulk. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, in a denſe Body, there is more matter, and therefore more form, and by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pactneſs of parts, there is more ſubſtance in a leſs ſpace, and therefore greater force. For parts condenſed are like many individuals joyned together, which act more powerfully then one. And therefore wherever there are more degrees of the ſame quality, whether they be collected by intenſion, or the magnitude of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, or the condenſation thereof, there is the greater Action.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things thus premiſed, we ſhall deliver our opinion concerning the action of things like,
<note place="margin">What kind of action there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt like things.</note> in theſe propoſitions. 1. <hi>Things like may act one upon another after the firſt manner, ſo that the more intenſe will intend the more remiſs; and that which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs will abate that which is intenſe.</hi> According to the common Axiome of Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which is a principle of the Art of compounding of Medicaments. For ſeeing action is betwixt contraries, not only the extreams do mutually act one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but alſo the Mediums and the extreams. For even by the Medium, as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, mutation is made. For as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath it in his 5. <hi>Phyſ. Cap.</hi> 1. <hi>T.</hi> 6. <hi>A Medium is in ſome ſort an extream.</hi> And that which is remiſs, is in place of the other contrary. And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf explains what he underſtands by contraries, in 1. <hi>de Gener. &amp; Corrup. Ch.</hi> 7. <hi>T.</hi> 51. <hi>Now becauſe the Agent and the patient are the ſame and like in kind, but unlike in ſort; and ſuch things are contraries: it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that actives and paſſives are one contrary to another, and alſo Mediums.</hi> Alſo experience proves the ſame thing, which teaches us, that a hotter thing added to a leſs hot, makes it more hot, and contrariwiſe; and that lukewarm Water put into that which is boyling hot, does allay the heat thereof; and continually from the mixture of that which is intenſe with that which is remiſs there reſults a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, more intenſe then the remiſs parts and more remiſs then the intenſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>Among things like, according to the ſecond way, there is no action.</hi> For ſeeing according to the ſort and degree, and the firſt act, wherein the Nature of qualities conſiſts, and to which mutation tends, theſe qualities are like, and are not of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſorts; and therefore are not contraries: therefore there can be no action be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:35070:54"/>them. For every action is betwixt contraries, and every agent by acting endeavours to make the Patient like it ſelf, and to give it the ſame Nature and Act. Moreover, ſince action ſuppoſeth eſſence, no thing which is in aptitude to be this or that, can be made actually ſo, but by that which is actually ſuch. And therefore a thing hot to four degrees, though it may be intended to more degrees; yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be by any thing intended, ſave by that which hath above four degrees of heat in it. Alſo experience juſtifies our aſſertion. For ſuppoſe for examples ſake, that there are two Bodies in the higheſt degree hot, the one greater and more compact, the other leſs and more ſpungy; the former indeed acts more vehemently, Yet can it not work upon the latter, becauſe it hath already attained the higheſt degree of heat.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. <hi>Alſo between things alike after the third manner, there is no action.</hi> For ſeeing it is rightly ſaid by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in is 1. <hi>de Gener. &amp; Corrup. Cap.</hi> 7. <hi>T.</hi> 31. That <hi>the Agent doth make the Patient like it ſelf:</hi> Betwixt things perfectly like, there can be no action. And from the premiſes it appears, betwixt what things there can be action and paſſion; which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath briefly comprehended, in the foreſaid place, where he ſaies: <hi>It is manifect both that contraries, and thoſe things alſo which are Mediums, do mutually act and ſuffer, one upon and from another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here ariſes another Controverſie from that which hath been ſaid, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Whether there be Reaction among the Elements.</note> That al things of the ſame kind, do mutually act and ſuffer one upon and from another; for it is hereupon diſputed; <hi>Whether amongſt the Elements there be a reciprocal Action and paſſion,</hi> Which they commonly term <hi>Reaction:</hi> or whether an agent, working by the firſt ſenſible qualities of it ſelf, being cloſe to the Patient and contrary thereunto, do ſuffer any thing likewiſe from the Patient. Now action is here by way of eminency aſcribed to the ſtronger, and paſſion to the weaker; and that action by which the Patient acts back again upon the ſtronger and more potent, is termed Reaction; and the paſſion whereby the agent being ſtronger receives the action of the weaker, may be termed Re-paſſion.</p>
                  <p>And beſides other things, which make a difficulty in this Caſe, which may be read in <hi>Tolet,</hi> L. 1. <hi>de Gen. &amp; Corrupt. Ch.</hi> 7. <hi>Q.</hi> 15. Zabarella <hi>de Reactione C.</hi> 2. <hi>Franc. Piccolhomineus L. de Effect. &amp; perpeſs. operant. per Nat. C.</hi> 20. Victor Trin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavellus <hi>in Queſt. de Reactione.</hi> That paſſage of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in his <hi>B. de Animal. Mot. C.</hi> 3. <hi>Whatever things are of equal ſtrength, they do not mutually act one upon another, but are overcome by exſuperancy,</hi> hath brought many into an Error: ſome ſo as quite to deny all Reaction; and others who ſaw it demonſtrated by reaſon and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that there was Reaction, ſo as to make them feigne falſe manners of Reacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For ſome hold, that there is indeed Reaction, but that either it is not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſame part, or not according to the ſame Contrariety. For if there be a certaine hot thing, which hath not an equal degree of heat in all its parts, they ſay it may act according to its ſtrong parts, and reſuffer according to its weak ones: but if all parts have equal Heat, then it cannot ſuffer any thing from the cold pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, according to the ſame contrariety, but according to ſome other: as if the fire act upon Water, it ſuffers nothing therefrom as it is cold, yet it may ſuffer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from as it is moiſt. Others do thus think: that Reaction is primarily indeed, and of it ſelf, according to a diverſe contrariety, but ſecondarily and by accident, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſame Contrariety. Foraſmuch as one quality may be corrupted primiarily by its contrary quality, and accidentally by the Corruption of that, wherewith it is Naturally in the ſubject: as for examples ſake, the Heat of Fire while it acts upon Water as cold, of it ſelf or primarily it reſuffers not from the coldneſs of the Water; yet becauſe the conjoyned drineſs ſuffers from the moiſture of the Water, it is alſo therewith debilitated and remitted.</p>
                  <p>You may read more opinions in the Authors forementioned all which rejecting, thus we determine: that there is a Reaction; and that it is according to the ſame contrariety, and the ſame part, and of it ſelf and primarily, And the firſt is taught, in the firſt Place, by experience. For if a Man take a piece of Ice in his Hand, both his Hand is cooled and the Ice is melted; and a red hot Iron caſt into cold Water, it heats the Water, and is cooled by the Water, And Reaſon proves the ſame. For reaction being taken away, there will be no Mixture: ſeeing mixture cannot be made, unleſs the qualities of the Elements being by mutual action and paſſion broken and remitted and altered, be reduced to a certain temper and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:35070:55"/>
                     <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaies the ſame, in 3. <hi>Phyſ. Cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Text</hi> 8.16. 1 <hi>de Gen. &amp; Corrup. Cap.</hi> 7. <hi>T.</hi> 53. <hi>C.</hi> 10. <hi>T.</hi> 87.89. <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Generib. Animal. Ch.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Experience teaches the other, which witneſſes that boyling Water and Cold, which are only oppoſite in heat and cold, if they be mixed together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come tempered, and that the boyling heat allaies the coldneſs of the cold Water, and the cold abateth the Heat of the boyling hot Water. For unleſs Reaction were according to the ſame contrariety, there could no mixture be made. For if the Fire as hot ſhould only act, and ſhould not ſuffer; the heat and moiſture of the Water would remain in the higheſt degree, and conſequently no mixture would be made. Moreover, every contrary, Naturally and of it ſelf, acts upon its contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as long as it is in preſence. Hither tends that, <hi>Out of the</hi> 3. <hi>de Gener. Anim. That which beates is cooled by that which is heated.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame Experience makes for the Third, and Reaſon teaches, that if there muſt be perfect mixture, all parts of the Elements muſt be altered, and reduced to a Mediocrity.</p>
                  <p>Experience alſo confirms the fourth, whereby we are taught, that hot and cold Water, which agree in moiſture, and are oppoſite only in heat and cold, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs mutually act and ſuffer. And truly, heat is not peculiarly joyned with moiſture or drineſs, but may conſiſt with either: whence it is alſo that the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which have affinity one to another in one of their qualities, do mutually act and ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>And that we may free our ſelves from that difficulty which hath ſeduced others, we are to know: that there is a twofold action, one imperfect and begun, which they cal an action without the Agents Victory, whereby the Agent does not change the whole Paſſive ſubject, but only weakens the ſame, and impreſſes ſome degree of a quality there into: the other perfect and compleat, which they cal an action with Victory of the Agent, whereby the Agent makes the Patient perfectly like it ſelf. Hence, we anſwer, 'tis one thing to act, another thing to overcome; one thing to ſuffer, another thing to be overcome. And therefore, if Action be taken in the firſt manner, for action begun, in every Alteration, there is Reaction, and the contrary Patient reacts upon the Agent; provided it be in fitting diſtance and quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity. For even that which hath leſs force, before it is quite overcome and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, makes impreſſion of ſome quality upon the ſtronger, and extinguiſhes ſome degrees of the contrary quality. But if action be taken for a perfect abolition of the other quality, there is no Reaction. For nothing can perfectly deſtroy a thing, and be perfectly deſtoied thereby. Wherefore that ſaying of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alleadged in his <hi>B. de Motu Animal. c.</hi> 3. muſt be underſtood of this action, and not of the former.</p>
                  <p>And ſo much ſhall ſuffice to have ſpoken of the mutual action and paſſion of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
<note place="margin">The defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mixture.</note> we now come to <hi>Mixture</hi> which reſults therefrom, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his 1 <hi>De Gen. et corrup cap.</hi> 10. Thus defines: <hi>Mixture is the union of things apt to be mingled, being firſt altered.</hi> Now things apt to be mingled, are ſuch as can ſubſiſt ſeparate, by themſelves, and they are only ſubſtances. Hence accidents are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaid to be mingled one with another, nor with their ſubſtances; and miſtion is properly of bodies, not of qualities: again, ſuch things as are contrary, and can mutually act and ſuffer; finally ſuch as can give a bulk to the mixt Body.</p>
                  <p>But here ariſes no light Queſtion,
<note place="margin">Whether or no and how the Elements remain in a mixt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy?</note> 
                     <hi>How Elements remain in mixt Bodies.</hi> For ſeeing the things mingled ought to be altered, not corrupted; it ſeems the Elements remain in the mixt body, but periſh not. Contrarily, ſeeing mixture is not only an heaping or jumbling together of the things mixed, but an Union, ſo that of many Natures one is made; it ſhould ſeem that the Elements do periſh, and that of them a certain new Nature is made: whereabouts, the opinions of Authors are various. We, rejecting the reſt, will follow <hi>Avicenna,</hi> whoſe opinion is approved of very many moſt learned Phyſitians, and ſeems ſo evident and firm to <hi>Fernelius,</hi> that in the <hi>Second Book of his Phyſiology, cha.</hi> 6. he calls the contrary opinion vain and childiſh, Yea and monſtrous, and ſuch he accounts it, as that it ſtains al the Glory of that Philoſopher that holds it. Now the opinion of <hi>Avicenna</hi> is, that the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do not only remain in the <hi>Mixt Bodies,</hi> but alſo <hi>retain their forms perfect and entire.</hi> For in the firſt place, ſeeing <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf, <hi>in the end of his Book
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:35070:55"/>de Ortu &amp; Interitu,</hi> defines mixture to be, <hi>The union of the things mingled, being Altered;</hi> The very Nature of mixture declares as much; Seeing things which are not preſerved cannot be mingled. Nor does the word union oppoſe this opinion. For <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion is the coupling of things which truly are,</hi> but not of things which are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed. And though of many things one is made; Yet neither is it neceſſary that thoſe ſimples ſhould periſh, nor is it a bare heaping together, but by a ſuperior form the ſimples are reduced into one Body. Moreover, ſince action ſuppoſes an act, and in mixt Bodies the Actions of the Elements appear, it muſt needs be that they are actually in them. Not to ſpeak of others, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf, <hi>in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his</hi> 1. <hi>de Caelo,</hi> writes that a mixt Body is moved according to the motion of the moſt prevalent Element. Finally, the reſolution of mixt Bodies into the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhews the ſame. For mixt bodies are reſolved into the Elements, and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf holds <hi>in</hi> 1. <hi>de Gen. &amp; Corrup. Text</hi> 84. That the things mixed may be again ſeparated from the mixt Body. Which if it may be, they muſt of neceſſity actually exiſt in the mixt Bodies.</p>
                  <p>Now their opinion is altogether fooliſh who hold, that the Elements do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn out of the mixt Body, the ſame in number, but the ſame in ſort; nor is it foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon any reaſon, but is only invented to palliate an abſurd opinion; rather it is oppoſite both to reaſon and Experience. For whereas they hold, that the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments return out of the mixt Body, by reaſon of the action of a like Element, whereby they recover that which they had loſt in the Mixture; how I pray you in diſtillations and burnings, can Water and Earth be drawn out of the compound, ſeeing the fire by acting upon the mixt Body, introduces nothing Watry, nor any thing Earthy: Yea the action of the Fire is contrary to the Water and the Earth, but does not augment, nor perfect the ſame?</p>
                  <p>And that which <hi>Averroes</hi> and <hi>Zabarella</hi> do produce concerning the refraction of forms, is a meer figment, and that opinion is ſufficiently refuted by the <hi>Latins,</hi> diſputing againſt the opinion of <hi>Averroes,</hi> who hold the forms of the Elements are capable of more and leſs; nor have they ever brought ſo much as a probable reaſon for their opinion, but only ſimply affirm, that forms have certain degrees, ſome of which being taken away, the reſt may remain.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit, not only the Concourſe and action of the Elements is requiſite, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a mixt body, but the direction of a ſuperior form muſt of neceſſity by joyned. Which thing alſo <hi>Scaliger</hi> acknowledged, where in his <hi>Exercitation,</hi> 307. <hi>Sect.</hi> 20. he thus writes, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs the four Elements ſhould have a Governour or Pilot, they would vainly and to no purpoſe toſs and be toſſed. For what is it that mingles ſo much Earth with the reſt? But there muſt be in every thing, one thing primarily moved. Now they cannot move themſelves to any work, but in Compounds, by a more excellent form, and in things imperfectly mixt, by an external principle, they are moved to a mutual connexion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus therefore we briefly expreſs the whole Nature of mixture. In mixture the ſimples muſt firſt of all be divided into very ſmal parts; therefore things Liquid, brittle, fine, are eaſily mingled. The Elements being thus divided into ſmal por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions according to the Nature of the mixt Body; they do by their contrary qualities mutually act one upon another, and ſuffer one from another; do hear, cool, moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten, dry one another mutually, and one acts upon another, as on a ſeparated con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: for they are not as yet united. But becauſe the force of heat and cold is greateſt, therefore theſe things do firſt temper themſelves, and the cold renders the heat temperate and moderate, as far as the Nature of the mixt Body to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced requires. This tempered heat does afterwards extenuate the moiſt and dry as the matter, that the parts of the ſimples may be perfectly mixed, according as the Nature of the mixt Body requires. For heat alone of it ſelf is the Author of mixture; but cold accidentally concurs to mixtion, inaſmuch as it moderates the heat.</p>

                     <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> defines in his 1. <hi>de Gen. &amp; Cor. cap.</hi> 4. <hi>t.</hi> 23. thus: <hi>Generation is the mutation of the whol, no ſenſible thing remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as the ſame ſubject.</hi> The Senſe of which definition is this; that Generation is a ſubſtantial mutation, wherein the ſpecifical form of a natural body being aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, a new one is produced, ſo that there remains not the ſame ſenſible ſubject of the form acquired, which was the ſubject of the form loſt, and the whol compound is ſaid to be corrupted, and a new one generated. For the whol, in the definition of Generation, dothnot ſignifie all the parts of a natural body; for the <hi>prima materia,</hi> or firſt matter is not corrupted: but the Integrity, Abſoluteneſs, and perfection of a natural body, conſiſting in its ſpecifick form; which is therefore by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſomtimes called <hi>Totum,</hi> becauſe it compleats and perfects the whol Eſſence of a thing. For as the ſort of a number is taken away, when one unity is ſubſtracted, and the number of ſeven ceaſes to be ſeven, when one is taken from it, although the other ſix unities remain: ſo, by reaſon of the ultimate and ſpecifick form of a natural body, the whol is ſaid to be changed and to periſh; ſo we ſay, an Horſe is periſhed, though the form only be periſhed, the Body ſtil remaining.</p>
                  <p>Herein therefore conſiſts the whol Nature of Generation and Corruption,
<note place="margin">Wherein the Nature of Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Corruption conſiſts.</note> that the laſt and ſpecifick form be aboliſhed, and another ariſe, or be introduced, by which the compound generated may differ ſpecifically or as another ſort, from the former which was ſaid to periſh, when the form periſheth. Hence alſo it appears how that common ſpeech, That Generation and Corruption is not of the form, but the matter, is to be underſtood. For the meaning thereof is not, as if all the parts of a natural body were corrupted, or bred a new; for the matter remains the ſame in all generation and corruption: but that, by the mutation of the ultimate and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick form the compound it ſelf is changed, and receives a new denomination.</p>
                  <p>Now that this is the Senſe of theſe words, and what is to be underſtood by the mutation of the whole, theſe following words of the ſame definition declare: <hi>No ſenſible thing remaining as the ſame ſubject.</hi> By which words <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> intimates; that in no ſubſtantial Generation the ſame ſenſible ſubject can remain for both forms, <hi>viz.</hi> that which is loſt and that which is gained. For though the <hi>materia prima</hi> be preſerved: yet is it not ſenſible: which is true not only in the generation of Elements, and of mixt bodies, but even of the generation of Animals. For when a living Creature periſhes, the form which is loſt, is the Soul: but that which is the form of a dead Carcaſs, is an inanimate mixt body, or a congeries or heap of many forms, which conſtitute many and divers homogeneal mixt bodies; and ſo theſe two forms have not one common ſenſible ſubject. For that which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a ſubject to the Soul, was the form of mixture: but the ſoul departing, thoſe forms of many homogeneal mixtures do no longer ſupply the place of a ſubject, but of ſpecifick forms, whoſe ſubject is the firſt matter. And although in the generation of a Carcaſs there comes no new form; yet it is all one, as if there came a new form. For the form of mixture in the living Creature, in reſpect of the whol live Creature, did hardly ſupply the place of a form, but rather of a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and Matter; ſince in every mixt thing, the Eſſential parts have the ſame reſpect one to another, that every precedent inferior, is to the following ſuperior, as Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Form, and aptitude to Act. But when the Soul is taken away, the form of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:35070:56"/>mixture ſupplies the place of the ſpecifick form, and really performs the office of a form, and gives denomination and ſpecifick being to the mixt body; which it did not do before, when the Soul was preſent.</p>
                  <p>Out of the Premiſes an Anſwer may eaſily be made to that Queſtion:
<note place="margin">Whether in Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there is a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution into the firſt matter.</note> 
                     <hi>whether be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the firſt matter, any form which was before in the thing corrupted, do remain in the thing Generated; or whether in every Generation there is a Reſolution into the</hi> Materia prima <hi>or firſt matter?</hi> For ſeeing things perfectly mixed, are either parts of living bodies, or other ſorts of bodies natural, as precious Stones and metals; and the generation of theſe things is performed, not only by the Concourſe, and action of the Elements, but by the direction of the upper form: again, it doth not alwaies draw and mingle ſimple Elements, for the formation of a body neceſſary to it ſelf, but alſo the firſt mixt bodies; therefore it is not neceſſary, that there ſhould be alwaies a reſolution into the firſt Matter.</p>
                  <p>Alſo from the Premiſes all the Cauſes of generation may be collected.
<note place="margin">The Form of Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. The Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</note> The form is expreſſed in the definition, by ſubſtantial Mutation. The common ſubject of generation, is the firſt matter it ſelf; and the immediate ſubject, are the four E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements of ſublunary things. The general and remote Efficient, is the Virtue of the Heavens: the immediate and adequate, is the Generator or Agent, <hi>viz.</hi> the forms of ſublunary things. For they by the firſt qualities and vital heat, as their immediate Inſtruments, do make mixt bodies for themſelves, neceſſary for their own preſervation, and the performance of their actions.</p>
                  <p>But the firſt matter is not the adequate cauſe of generation: ſeeing it is a being, meerly potential, and can beget or effect nothing, but only ſuffer. And therefore the matter is a cauſe that the Generation may be made; but the Agent or Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, is the cauſe that it is actually made. The End of Generation,
<note place="margin">The End.</note> is the Conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſeveral ſorts of Natural things. For ſince in the ſublunary part of the world there is no perpetuity and eternity of individuals or particular things; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture conſerves the Eternity of every ſort, by the perpetuity of Generation.</p>
                  <p>The definition of generation, agrees alſo to coruption, as manifeſtly appears out of the laſt words of <hi>Text</hi> 22. <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>de Gen. et Cor.</hi> and appears from the thing it ſelf. For the generation of one thing, is the corruption of another; as is wel ſaid by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> 1. <hi>de Gener, &amp; Cor. c.</hi> 3. <hi>T.</hi> 17. For, ſince that which corrupted is not turned meerly into nothing, but the matter remains; and it cannot ſubſiſt of it ſelf, without any form; it muſt be, that one compound being aboliſhed, and one form deſtroied, another form ſhould come, to conſtitute a new compound. Moreover, ſince two ſpecifick forms cannot be in the ſame ſubject (for nothing can be at the ſame time under ſeveral ſorts) it muſt needs be, that when one form comes, the other which was before in the ſubject, muſt give way. Hence alſo came that ſaying; That Nature primarily intends generation,
<note place="margin">Nature primarily intends ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neratoon, ſecondari-corruption.</note> ſecondarily corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For one thing cannot be generated, unleſs another be corrupted. For ſince the intention of the Generator, is to make the Patient like it ſelf; and this it cannot do, unleſs it firſt deſtroy the form therof: ſecondarily therefore it deſires the deſtruction of another. And this is the Cauſe of the perpetuity of Generations and Corruptions; <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe the matter when it is robbed of one form, receives ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and when it puts on one, it puts off another. Yet it muſt be here obſerved, that the Generation of one, is not the corruption of a body of the ſame ſort, but of another of a different ſort.</p>
                  <p>Having thus explained the univerſal Nature of Generation, let us now ſpeak of the ſorts of Generation. The Proportion of the Elements which act one upon another is various: For ſomtimes one contrary only prevails in ſtrength over an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, ſo as to be able quite to aboliſh the ſame, and to turn it into its own Nature; and then there happens the generation of one ſimple Element. Somtimes the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are after a ſort equal, or at leaſt their inequality is not ſo great, that one of them can quite deſtroy the other, and turn it into its own Nature; and then, by mutual action and paſſion they weaken one another, and making friends as it were, they grow together, into the Nature of one mixed Body. Now we ſhall ſpeak in the firſt place, of the generation of Elements. And although, not only <hi>Enpedocles,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Whether the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments can be changed one into another.</note> and other Ancient Philoſophers, but alſo ſome late writers, deny that the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are turned one into another: yet we ſhall retain the common Doctrine, which is proved by reaſon and experience. For we ſee daily, that by fire other
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:35070:57"/>Elements are turned into Fire; and water, which of its own Nature is moved down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when it is ſet over the fire, turns to Air and mounts of its own accord up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, which motion belongs properly to Fire and Air. Now the Reaſon is this: thoſe things are apt to be changed one into another, which are contraries, and have one common ſubject. And ſuch are the Elements: for they have the firſt matter for their common ſubject, and contrary qualities. And therefore they may be changed one into another. Howbeit, the Elements are changed, not in whole, but in part.</p>
                  <p>And indeed all Elements are apt to be mutually changed, and there is none of them, which may not be changed into another: for as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaies in 2. <hi>de Gen. et Cor. c.</hi> 4. <hi>T.</hi> 24. <hi>Generation in out of Contraries into Contraries, and all the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have a Contrariety one to another, becauſe the differences are contrary.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, theſe Elements which agree in one quality, as fire and Air in heart, water and Air in moiſture, are more eaſily and ſpeedily changed one into another: but thoſe Elements which are quite contrary and diſagree in both qualities, are more hardly changed one into another. For when two things joyned together are to be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by their contraries, they reſiſt more ſtrongly, then when one quality only is contrary, and the other like; becauſe by reaſon of that ſimilitude, the approach of the contrary is more eaſie. And therefore of two contrary Elements, a Medium is ſooner generated, then one of another: and we ſee that of Fire and Water, Air is bred. For the Medium agrees with both, in qualities.</p>
                  <p>And ſo much of the Generation of Elements.
<note place="margin">Mixture and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of a mixt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, differ not really, but only in reſpect.</note> Let us now come to the ſimple ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of mixt bodies. Now the <hi>Generation of a mixt Body and Mixture,</hi> of which we ſpake in the foregoing Chapter, are really one and the ſame thing: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they differ in reſpect. For both mixture, and the Generation of a mixt Body, doth ſignifie a certain progreſs to the form of a mixt Body, which conſiſts firſt in mutual alteration, cauſed by the action and paſſion of the firſt qualities; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the action of the two active qualities upon the two paſſive, or in the mixture of moiſt with dry; Finally and chiefly, in the production of the form it ſelf: and therefore both the generation of a mixt body conſiſts in Mixture, and Mixture is contained in the Generation of a mixt Body. For the term union, doth not only ſignifie a collection of the Elements, and a placing them together; but a producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one Nature, out of ſeveral things mingled.</p>
                  <p>Yet they <hi>different reſpect.</hi> For ſince both in mixture, and in the Generation of a mixt Body, the Elements are as it were the term <hi>a Quo,</hi> and the mixt Body, the term <hi>ad Quem;</hi> the term mixture, doth chiefly reſpect the Elements, for the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is of the Elements, and not of the mixt Body: but the term Generation reſpects the mixt Body it ſelf. For <hi>that</hi> is then ſaid to be generated, and not the Elements. Nor yet can the one be without the other; nor doth mixture in time or Nature pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede Generation: both conſiſt in the production of one Nature.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> defines the Generation of a mixt Body,
<note place="margin">The defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a mixt body.</note> 
                     <hi>in the</hi> 4. <hi>of his Meteors Ch.</hi> 7. after this manner: <hi>Generation is a ſimple mutation, by the active faculties, when they have their reſpect, from the matter ſubject to every nature.</hi> Now, this is the ſenſe of this definition: the Generation of a mixt Body, is a ſubſtantial mutation, made by the two active qualities, acting upon the two paſſive, as their ſubject matter, and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling over them in ſuch a proportion, as is neceſſary to draw forth the form proper to every mixt Body. For the active qualities are not alwaies in an equal propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the paſſive, but variouſly proportioned, according to the divers Natures of mixt Bodies, which require ſundry temperaments. Nor is the dominion of the active qualities over the paſſive, ſo to be underſtood, as though in every mixt Body, the active qualities did in ſome degrees exceed the paſſive; ſince experience doth teſtifie the Contrary, which teaches, that ſome mixt things, are to be termed not, ſome cold, ſome moiſt, ſome dry, according to the Nature of the over-ruling qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: but this dominion is only to be underſtood in reſpect of the form of the mixt Body, to be Generated. For then Namely, the active Qualities are ſaid to rule over the paſſive, when the proportion of the former to the latter is ſuch, that out of them they might produce ſome certain form of a mixt Body. For even that which is hot to four degrees, acts upon that which is moiſt to ſix, and there of makes a certain mixt Body.</p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:35070:57"/>
                  <p> That Queſtion alſo muſt not be here omitted; <hi>Whether in this Caſe the power of the two active Qualities be equal, and their office and Dominion equal.</hi> Touching which we are to know, that both the Generation of the mixt body it ſelf, and the alteration previous to the form, do proceed of themſelves and primarily from hear, and that cold doth no other wiſe concur, then as it tempers and moderates the heat, and makes it fit to produce this or that mixt Body. For the Generation of a mixt Body does chiefly conſiſt in a perfect mixture of moiſt and dry, ſuitable to the Nature of the mixt Body: but this cannot be done, ſave by attenuation, which makes that all the particles of the moiſt matter may be exactly united with the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the dry; now extenuation of it ſelf is cauſed by heat, ſomtimes greater and ſomtimes leſs. But cold of it ſelf is not an inſtrument of generation, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of corruption. Howbeit, in a mixt body already generated, and conſtituted in its eſſence, even cold alſo acts of it ſelf, and confers thereon its perfection as it were, and aptitude to its operations. For mixt bodies are congealed and conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by cold.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, after the Generation of a mixt Body, it remains that we now treat of the Natural deſtruction thereof, which is <hi>Putrefaction:</hi> concerning which, ſo great are the Controverſies amongſt learned Men, that ſome late Phyloſophers and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians have filled whole Books with diſputes about putrefaction. We, though much might be ſaid thereof, ſhall briefly diſcourſe thereupon, ſo much as the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our work will bear.
<note place="margin">Putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the generation of mixt bodies.</note> And ſeeing Putrefaction is oppoſed to the Generation of mixt bodies, we may eaſily proceed from the knowledg of Generation to the knowledg of putrefaction. It hath been already ſaid, that the whole Nature of mixture, or of the Generation of a mixt Body, doth conſiſt in a due conjunction of moiſt parts with dry, which is cauſed by heat, in a certain degree: and ſince the Cauſe of the Generation and conſervation of a mixt Body is the ſame; a mixt body ſhall ſo long remain in its Natural State, as there is a due and juſt mixture of moiſt and dry, under a fitting dominion of heat: and the Deſtruction of a mixt Body muſt proceed from the ſeparation of the moiſt and dry parts: which muſt ariſe from the abolition or abatement of Natural Heat. For the Natural heat diminiſhed on aboliſhed, can no longer retain the dry parts joyned to the moiſt. Now the Cauſe which weakens the Natural heat, is the heat of the Ambient Body, which if it be ſtronger, calls forth the Natural. For the Natural heat being encreaſed by the ambient heat, loſes the proportion it ought to hold to the paſſive Qualities, and therefore vapors away, and leaves the mixt Body; whereof the moiſt and dry parts being deſtitute and having loſt their governor as it were, they become ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the moiſt parts are carried with the Heat as its conveiance, into the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and ſo vapours away; and ſo comes putrefaction, which is only the deſtruction of a mixt Body, conſidered as ſuch. I ſay the Natural deſtruction, that is, which happens according to the Laws of Nature Univerſal, which wil have all mixt things ſubject to corruption, and to be at laſt reſolved into the Elements whereof they were made: as violent deſtruction of a mixt Body is when the whole is changed into one Element, as by burning, or alſo by overmuch cooling, as ſome will have it.</p>
                  <p>All this whole Nature of Putrefaction <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the 4. <hi>Meteorol. Cap.</hi> 1. hath comprehended in this definition:
<note place="margin">The defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of Putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> 
                     <hi>Putrefaction is the corruption of the proper and Natural heat, which is in every moiſt Body, by the Heat which is without the ſame, Namely, in the ambient Body.</hi> Which Definition contains all the Terms of a perfect Demonſtration, and Demonſtrates a proper Affection of its proper ſubject, by its proper Cauſe.
<note place="margin">Its ſubject</note> The proper ſubject is <hi>a moiſt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi> For nothing can putrefie, unleſs it be moiſt. And therefore <hi>all mixt Bodies putrefie, inaſmuch as they are moiſt.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The next Cauſe.</note> The next poſitive cauſe is the <hi>Heat of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bient Body;</hi> which is not only Air and Water, but every thing containing, which overmuch augments the internal heat, and diſturbs the proportion which it bears to the reſt of the Qualities. Its adjunct is the Corruption of the internal Heat,
<note place="margin">Its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct.</note> and of the ſubſtantial form it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>From theſe things thus explained an anſwer may be made to many Queſtions.
<note place="margin">Why all things that putrifie become at laſt cold?</note> For hence that Queſtion may eaſily be anſwered, <hi>Why all things which putrifie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come at laſt cold?</hi> Although in the beginning they were hot. The cauſe of the former is the corruption of the inbred heat; of the latter, both the external heat alſo, which encreaſes the internal, is the Cauſe; and becauſe the internal heat, the proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:35070:58"/>diſturb'd which it bore to the reſt of the Qualities of the mixt Body, going out, doth more ſhew it ſelf to the ſenſe. For in the mixture it was ſo tempered, and joyned in ſuch a league of friendſhip as it were with the reſt of the Qualities of the mixt Body, that it could hardly be perceived by the ſenſe; which League being broken in the Putrefaction, it becomes more ſenſible, and acts more freely.</p>
                  <p>And upon this foundation depends that ſame diſtinction of Phyſitians,
<note place="margin">Why things putrifying, become at firſt moiſt and then dry?</note> whereby they ſay, that ſome things are actually Hot or Cold, others potentially: and they ſay that Pepper, Ginger and Wine, are only potentially Hot, becauſe they are not hot to feel to, but only when they are within the Body, and diſſolved by the heat of the Stomach. For the Cauſe hereof is, that Pepper, Ginger and Wine, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they contain much heat in them; yet the ſame is ſo tempered with other Qualities, that is doth not put forth its force, while it ſticks in the mixt Body abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in its Natural condition. But when a man hath taken them into his Stomach, that ſame harmony of qualities is diſſolved and diſturbed by the heat of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and the Heat of theſe mixt Bodies is called forth; which doth work more freely and ſtrongly, (the friendſhip it had with the reſt of the Qualities being now broke) no longer as the heat of a mixt Body, but rather as heat now ſeparated, and left to its own Liberty.</p>
                  <p>And the Cauſe is the ſame, why things putrifying become at firſt more moiſt, and at laſt are quite dried up. For the moiſture together with the heat vapors out, flows abroad, and goes to the outward parts; Which at laſt being quite diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated and evaporated, the mixt Body turns to Duſt and Aſhes. Alſo hence a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may be given why mixt Bodies in hot Seaſons and places do ſooner putrifie then in cold;
<note place="margin">Why mixt bodies ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt put ifie in hot ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and places.</note> and why things very hot or very cold do not eaſily putrifie. The Cauſe of the former is, that in cold times and places the heat of the Ambient (if any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main therein.) is not ſo ſtrong as to be able to cal out the internal heat: but in an hot time and place the Contrary happens. And the Reaſon of the latter is, becauſe both a ſtrong internal cold reſiſts the heat of the Ambient,
<note place="margin">Why things very cold or hot do not ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly putrifie.</note> ſo that it cannot corrupt and cal out the inbred heat; and a ſtrong internal heat doth not ſuffer it ſelf to be overcome by the heat external. Nor can an external weak heat ſo intend an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſtrong one, that it can be no longer fit to conſerve the mixt Body. Hence alſo a great Quantity is leſs apt to putrifie then a ſmal one;
<note place="margin">Why agreat Quantity is leſs apt to putrifie then aſmal one, and that which is in moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then that which reſts.</note> becauſe in a great Body there is more heat or cold, which alſo doth more ſtrongly reſiſt the external heat. Alſo a thing moved doth not ſo eaſily putrifie, as that which reſts, becauſe it is leſs ſubject to the action of the ambient heat.</p>
                  <p>Now from what hath been ſaid the Nature of putrefaction is ſufficiently apparent: and yet many diſpute at large, whether it be only one, or there be divers ſorts thereof. We, omitting tedious diſputes, do acknowledg only <hi>one</hi> putrefaction, <hi>viz.</hi> That which is explained, in the foreſaid definition of <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> Yet we grant there is ſome diverſity in the putrefaction of things, becauſe of the Various Nature and conſtitution of the mixt Bodies which putrefie.
<note place="margin">There is only one putriſ acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> For thoſe things do perfectly and totally putrefie, which are perfectly reſolved into the Elements whereof they were made, ſo that all the other Elements evaporating, there remains nothing at laſt but Earth: and thus all thoſe things putrefie which have much Earth in them.</p>
                  <p>But thoſe things putrifie imperfectly and in part, which contain more moiſture in them. For ſeeing the moiſture which is more abundant in them cannot be with the heat totally drawn out: only ſome parts thereof, eſpecially the more thin and ſubtile are drawn out, and the reſt are preſerved; and this is termed putrefaction according to part; the Nature whereof is nevertheleſs the ſame with that of the putrifaction before defined. For herein the internal heat is corrupted by the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. After this manner Wine putrifies, and the Humor in our Bodies; the three Elements,
<note place="margin">The Fire doth not putrifie.</note> Air, Water, Earth, inaſmuch as they are not pure, but in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure mixt with other things. The Fire alone does not putrifie, for this Cauſe eſpecially, becauſe nothing is more hot then it, which may corrupt and cal out its heat.
<note place="margin">Whether the form he aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifaction.</note> But whether or no in this imperfect putrefaction the form of the mixt Body do quite periſh, and a new mixt thing be produced, or whether only ſome altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be made, is a doubtful caſe. We anſwer briefly: in every true putrefaction ſomwhat is corrupted: but of an imperfect putrefaction there are more degrees,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:35070:58"/>one greater another leſs. For ſomtimes the putrifaction is ſo light, that ſome particles only being corrupted, the mixt Body doth ſtil retain its proper form: but ſomtimes again it is ſo great, that though the whole mixt Body be not quite reſolved into its Elements, yet the whole form thereof is aboliſhed, and the ſaid Body chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into another ſort. And therefore al Putrefaction is Corruption, and not Alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation only. For although the Blood which putrifies in the Veins, is not wholly corrupted, but only altered in part: yet thoſe parts which are ſaid to putrifie, are really corrupted according to their ſubſtance, and cannot return to their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſtate, but muſt be evacuated by Purgation: but the others which are not corrupted in their ſubſtance, are not properly ſaid to putrifie, but only to be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the putrified parts.</p>

<note place="margin">Whence tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends?</note> certain it is that it depends upon the mixture of the Elements, and ariſes from the action and paſſion of the firſt qualities: yet what it is, is not ſo manifeſt. We, omitting the opinions of <hi>Fuchſius</hi> who not rightly, aſſerts in the 1 <hi>of his Juſt. Med. S.</hi> 3. <hi>C.</hi> 2. That a Temperament is a ſubſtance, not an accident, and of others who hold that a Temperament is a bare Relation and Harmony of Qualities, as alſo of others, which are by other Authors reckoned up; we hold, that <hi>a Temperament in one Quality, ariſing from the mutual action and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the firſt Qualities in mixtion.</hi> For the fight of the firſt Qualities, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the Generation of a mixt Body proceeds ſo far, till they be all refracted and abated, and having caſt away certain degrees of Contrarieties, by which they were at extream variance, Friendſhip being made, as it were, they joyn and grow together into one Quality. And ſo a temperament is nothing elſe but one Quality of a ſimple Eſſence, which is made up of the remiſs degrees of the four Qualities. For as of the remiſs degrees of the Elementary forms one ſimple actual form doth ariſe, which nevertheleſs contains them all in its faculty: ſo out of the firſt Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities there ariſes one moderate and actually ſimple Quality which potentially contains them all. But we muſt not ſay (which opinion as ſome learned men tell us, is ill fathered upon <hi>Avicenna</hi>) that a Temperament is a certain fift Quality, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe from the four firſt, and ſuperadded to them; but only a middle one, ariſing from the others abated and conjoyned, and containing them in it.</p>
                  <p>But ſince the Elements are in ſundry manners mixed,
<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> and the firſt qualities are tempered together in ſundry proportions; hence there ariſe ſundry diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of temperaments. For if the Elements and Qualities concur to the mixture in ſtrength and degrees perfectly equal, a temperament is effected, which is called <hi>Equale ad pondus,</hi> Equal in weight;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> ad pondu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, <hi>what it is?</hi>
                     </note> as if in it the degrees of the Qualities were weighed and diſtributed in an equal weight; alſo abſolute equality, becauſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon is not made to any extrinſecal thing. Now this is to be underſtood of the equality of degrees. For the Elements cannot be mixed in equal Quantity; ſince the efficacy of Fire is much greater then that of Earth; and therefore if they ſhould concur in equal portions, the Fire would not generate a mixt Body, but only Fire: and experience teſtifies, that all perfectly mixt Bodies do obtaine very much Earth, by Virtue whereof they become heavy.
<note place="margin">Whether there be an equal tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament.</note> Though ſome deny that this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is to be found in Nature; yet we ſee no firme Reaſon to hinder us from hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that the contrary qualities may meet in the ſame degree, to the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of a mixt Body. Yea and <hi>Galen</hi> ſaies that this is the Rule of all the reſt, and that the reſt cannot be known without it, <hi>in his B. de Temperam. C.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:35070:59"/>
                  <p> There is moreover as yet another equal temperament,
<note place="margin">A tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to juſtice, what it is?</note> which is called equal <hi>ad Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam,</hi> wherein the qualities concur, not in a degree abſolutely equal, but in ſuch a manner as is moſt convenient to the form of the mixt bodie and to the performance of its gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and which holds a medium amongſt mixt bodies of the ſame ſort. For one mixt body of its own Nature is hotter, another colder; one moiſter another dryer. The temperament of a Lion is more hot then the temperament of a Fiſh; fleſh is hotter then a never; a bone dryer then fleſh. And although in this manner this tempertment may be called equal, <hi>viz.,</hi> becauſe that equality is kept therein, which is convenient to every mixt body, and according to Geometrical proportion every one hath his own: yet in reſpect of a temperament abſolutely temperate and equal, it is termed unequal; and that body furniſhed therewith may be termed intemperate: although commonly that is called intemperate which is departed from the temper which Naturaly it ought to have.</p>
                  <p>Now how many ſorts there are of this temperament Authors agree not.
<note place="margin">Eight ſorts of tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raments e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of juſtice.</note> We hold with <hi>Galen,</hi> 1 <hi>de temp. C.</hi> 8. For when only one quality ſuperabounds, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercomes its contrary, the two reſt keep equality; for examples ſake, if any mixt body ſhould have five degrees of Heat, and three of cold, and four of moiſture, and as many of dry; it ſhould be called a ſimple temperament. Of which there are four ſorts; hot, wherein heat exceeds cold, and moiſture and dryneſs are equal; cold, wherein cold exceeds heat, and moiſture and dryneſs are alſo equal; moiſt, wherein moiſture exceeds dryneſs, and heat and cold are equal; dry, wherein drineſs exceeds moiſture, and Heat and cold are alſo equal. But when two Qualities exceed the other two, 'tis called a compound Temperament; of which there are againe four ſorts, according to the four poſſible combinations of the four firſt Qualities; <hi>viz.</hi> Hot and moiſt; hot and drie; cold and moiſt; cold and drie. According to theſe differences a thing is ſaid to be temperate or intemperate:
<note place="margin">How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waies a thing is ſaid to be temperate, and not temperate</note> but after ſeveral manners. For a thing is ſaid to be ſo and ſo, abſolutely or reſpectively. Abſolutely only the Elements are hot, cold, moiſt, drie; ſeeing in them only theſe qualities are ſincere and pure. Now by compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and exſuperance a thing is ſaid to be ſo, which though it have all the Qualities, yet one excells the reſt; ſo that is termed hot which hath more heat; and that cold, which hath more coldneſs. Now this compariſon is made to four things; either to the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Nature of all mixt bodies, wherein if you can conceive any thing of an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent temper, ſuch as is the skin of a man, eſpecially that on the palms of his hands and the tops of his fingers, (unto which therefore they refer the judgement of all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraments;) all other things in reſpect thereunto will be called intemperate, and according to the Quality exceeding this Mean, they ſhall be called hot, cold, moiſt, drie; Or the compariſon is made to the next kind; as if in the whole kind of Living Creatures you ſhall conceive ſome one to be temperate, as perhaps Man is; all other animals ſhall be called intemperate, the name being borrowed from the exceeding Quality: or compariſon is made to ſomewhat Indifferent, in the ſame ſort; ſo a young man is ſaid to be hot, and an old man to be cold: or finally, compariſon is made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt divers ſorts, or any obvious individualls. So a dog, in reſpect of a Lion is cold, in reſpect of a Fiſh hot. So <hi>Peter</hi> compared to <hi>Paul</hi> is hot: but if you compare him to another more hot, he is cold.</p>
                  <p>And this may ſuffice to have ſaid in this place concerning temperaments: let us proceed now to concoction,
<note place="margin">The defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of concoction</note> which is a certain perfection and compleatment of the temperament. Now thus <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (in his 4 <hi>Meteor. Ch.</hi> 2.) Defines concoction. <hi>Concoction is a perfection, by the Natural</hi> &amp; <hi>proper Heat, made of oppoſite paſſives, which are the proper matter to each one.</hi> This definition as every orderly definition of adjuncts or accidents, hath in ſtead of kind the form, in ſtead of difference the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, with the efficient cauſe: all which are to be conſidered in this place, that we may attain the perfect knowledg of Digeſtion or Concoction.</p>
                  <p>The Form of Concoction is nothing but the ultimate perfection of the proper tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of a thing.
<note place="margin">The form of conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> For then a thing is ſaid to be concocted, when it hath attained that perfection and compleatneſs, in its qualities or temperament, which it ought to have. And therefore that perfection is here to be underſtood which conſiſts in Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and not that which is Eſſential, proceeding from the ſubſtantial form. Which alſo <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſignifies <hi>in the</hi> 12. <hi>Sect. Prob.</hi> 7. <hi>Concoction is the alteration of the thing concocted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:35070:59"/>
                  <p> The matter or ſubject of concoction are the two paſſive Qualities,
<note place="margin">The Sub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ject.</note> but eſpecialy moiſture. And hence it appears, that coction is an affection of a mixt bodie, as it is moiſt, and that it doth not belong only to the meat of living Creatures, becauſe other things alſo are ſaid to be concocted, which can never become nouriſhment for animals. Hence alſo t'is manifeſt, that coction belongs to a thing already engendred and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by its own Nature. For nothing is ſaid to be concocted, but that which is already engendred, only it hath imperfection in its temper, which muſt by further altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be perfected; which being done the thing is ſaid to be concocted.</p>
                  <p>As to the Efficient Cauſe:
<note place="margin">The Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Cauſe.</note> 
                     <hi>The beginning of perfection</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) <hi>comes from the proper heat of the ſubject, although it be perfected by ſome outward help.</hi> The principal cauſe is alwaies the proper heat of the thing; although ſometimes it be not ſufficient, and therefore ſtands in need as it were of another Aſſiſtant, that the conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction may be thereby better and more rightly performed. So Bathes and Plaiſters help the Concoction in the Stomack. So Medlars and other Fruits being gathered before they are ripe and laid up, are ripened by their own Heat: yet the Suns Heat contributes much towards their more happy ripening.</p>
                  <p>This therefore is the manner of the whole buſineſs of concoction.
<note place="margin">The Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction.</note> When as in a mixt body, already conſtituted by its form, there is as yet ſome imperfection in the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the moiſture is not ſufficiently maſtered and tempered, nor holds a juſt and exact proportion to the drineſs and other Qualities: the Natural Heat conſumes and excels the ſuperfluous moiſture, and that which remains and offends not in quantity, it reſtrains and limits, and unites it with drineſs, as much as the Nature of the mixt Body requires; which action is termed coction, or concoction.</p>
                  <p>And that the Nature of concoction may be the better underſtood,
<note place="margin">The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal End.</note> 
                     <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> beſides the internal End, which is the ſame with the form, adds alſo an External one, in theſe words: <hi>The end of concoction in ſome things is their Nature, which we call the ſort as it were &amp; Eſſence; in others it tends to ſome ſubject forme, when the Humidity is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſuch and ſo great.</hi> In which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> Teaches, that the External End is twofold; either the form ſimply and abſolutely, which End chiefly appears in the ripening of Fruits, which are then ſaid to be ripe, when the ſeed is now ſo perfect, as that it can breed its like: or ſome form or diſpoſition, to the affording ſome utility, which conſiſts either in the induction of a new form, or in preparation for the convenient expulſion of things unprofitable. The former uſe appears in that boiling of the meat, performed in the ſtomack. For that is therefore ordained, that the meats taken in might by the faculty in the ſtomach be turned into <hi>Chylus.</hi> For ſuch alſo is the Natural Concoction of flegm. The other appears in the Concoction of putrified humors in ulcers, and elſewhere in the Body of an Animal, which are then concocted and ripened, when they are ſo laboured by the Natural Heat, as to become apt for expulſion. For ſince by reaſon of their great corruption they cannot arrive to any perfect form and profitable to nouriſh the Body, they are by concoction brought to ſome form better at leaſt then putrefaction. And thus Concoction doth repreſs Putrefaction, and puts an End thereunto, and ſevers the corrupt humors from the profitable, and renders them fit to be euacuated without hurt to the Body.</p>
                  <p>Things therefore are ſaid to be concocted, when the matter of coction, which is chiefly moiſture, ſhal be overcome by heat and bounded thereby, and have received it's fitting thickneſs. And therefore Urines, Dung, and all the excrements of our Bodies in like manner, being rightly digeſted, are a ſigne of Health. For they declare that the Heat hath its full power in our Bodies: and that it is ſo much as to be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine and duly to tame and keep in order all the humors. And for the ſame Cauſe, all things being digeſted become thicker and hotter. For Heat which bears the Rule in concoction, doth both Heat and Reſolve the thin Parts. Which is alſo confirmed by Experience. For Apples, Pears, Grapes, and all other Fruits, before they grow Ripe are colder then they are afterwards: and Milk, Seed, Quittour in Ulcers, and Filth gathered in the corners of the Eyes, are thicker when concocted then before. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, we muſt here take notice, when it is ſaid, that things Concocted are thicker and hotter then Unconcocted, that one thing muſt not be compared with another of a diſtinct ſort, or with it ſelf after it hath changed its <hi>ſpecies;</hi> but the ſame ſort of thing being unconcocted, muſt be compared with it ſelf concocted.</p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:35070:60"/>
                  <p> To Coction is oppoſed Crudity,
<note place="margin">The defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of Crudity.</note> or indigeſtion, which is by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in 4. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teor.</hi> thus defined: <hi>Crudity is an imperfection of the paſſive Qualities, through the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of proper beat in the ſubject. And the defect of heat is cold.</hi> From which defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it is apparent, that in Crudity all things are quite contrary to what they are in Coction, ſaving the ſubject, which is one and the ſame. For the Form was there perfection, and here it is imperfection; there the efficient Cauſe was heat, here want of heat, or Coldneſs. And therefore thoſe things are generally to be called Crude, which have not as yet obtained thoſe degrees of perfection in the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or Temperament, which they ought to have; and in which moiſture abounds, and by reaſon of the weakneſs of Heat cannot be rightly maſtered and Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>Having explained the Nature of Coction and Crudity,
<note place="margin">Coction is not an univocal kind.</note> let us now come to their Sorts. Where it is firſt to be obſerved; That Coction is not an univocal kind, but of the number of thoſe which are called <hi>Pros Hen,</hi> to one, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its definition doth chiefly agree to the principal and primary ſort (which is the manner in defining thoſe things which are ſaid of ſome one) but a little change be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made, they may alſo be accommodated to the reſt. Now the primary ſort of Coction, and which can perhaps alone perfectly bear the name of Coction, is ripening, which it ſelf alſo nevertheleſs is not equally applied to all the ſorts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained there under.
<note place="margin">Ripening what it is?</note> For properly <hi>Ripening is the Concoction of that Aliment which is in the Pulp of an Apple, Pear, or any other fruit.</hi> But for more eaſie underſtanding ſake, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> applies Maturity, or Ripeneſs, only to fruits; though it be common to all Animals, Plants, and Seeds when referred to Generation. Now then Matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is ſaid to be made, when the Seed which is contained in the Pulp of the fruit is ſo Elaborated, that it is able to beget its like. For at firſt, when there is as yet a ſuperfluous moiſture remaining, the Seed is not yet ſit for Generation: but when the humidity ſhall by the Natural Heat be partly conſumed, partly better ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated, the Seed becomes ſit for Generation. Again, Figuratively, Flegm, quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and other Humors in our Bodies are ſaid to be Ripened, when they are by the Natural Heat ſo digeſted, as either to become ſit to nouriſh, or if they cannot nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, that at leaſt they may be diſpoſed to Evacuation. Now, by ripening, fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulent things become Watry, Watry things become thin; thin things become thick. For at firſt the ſpirit, or flatulent matter is digeſted by heat; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the Watry Humor is further digeſted, and its thinner parts are reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <p>To Maturity or Ripeneſs is oppoſed Immaturity or Unripeneſs,
<note place="margin">What im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maturity is?</note> what as Maturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is alſo twofold: one properly ſo called, another ſiguratively. For immaturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty properly ſo called is the rawneſs of the nouriſhment which is in the Pulp of an Apple or other fruit, by Reaſon of the Penury or ill proportion of the Natural heat. For when the Heat is ſo little, or the Humor ſo plentiful, that the Heat cannot exactly maſter the moiſture, there ariſes immaturity, and then the Seed is not fit for Generation. And therefore all unripe things are windy, wateriſh, and their Humors thin and cold, unfit to nouriſh. And afterward Figuratively, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrhs, Spittle, Quittor in Ulcers, and Urin are termed crude. Alſo Milk unboi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led is termed crude or raw; as alſo Tiles and all Earthen Ware, is termed raw, before it is baked.</p>
                  <p>Another ſort of Coction is <hi>Boyling,</hi> which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the <hi>fourth of his Meteors Ch.</hi> 3. thus defines: <hi>Elixation or Boyling, Generally, is the Concoction of ſomwhat Indeterminate in an Humor, cauſed by a moiſt heat.</hi> For boyling is thus made. A fiery heat being received in a Watry moiſture, doth moiſten the thing to be boyled, opens its pores, and makes them Wider, and ſo draws the moiſture of the thing to be boyled from the Centre to the Circumference; and the reſt of the Humor which remains, it digeſts, Tames, and Terminates; and therefore boyled things have leſs Native moiſture, and more of that which is forreigne. And for this cauſe, Cooks that would Roaſt Meats carefully, do firſt perboyl them, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſome of that Humor and Excrements which are within, may be firſt drawn out, ſo that the reſt may be by roaſting more eaſily conſumed.</p>
                  <p>From the premiſes it appears, that thoſe things only can be boyled which have moiſture, which by the fiery heat which is in a Watry moiſture may be overcome. And that thoſe things cannot be boyled, which either are Earthy, and have in a
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:35070:60"/>manner no moiſture, as Stones, Bones, &amp;c. Or which have indeed ſome moiſture, but which is ſo condenſed and Joyned with an Earthy dryneſs, that by a moiſt heat it cannot be called out and Vanquiſhed, as Woods, Metals, &amp;c. And for this very cauſe, the fleſh of old Animals is hardly boyled tender, in compariſon of yonger; and Beef is harder to boyl then Hens-fleſh: becauſe the former are more dry, Earthy, ſolid and compact, and have their moiſture more tenaciouſly faſtened with their dryneſs, ſo that it cannot eaſily be called out by a moiſt heat. Alſo Woods, Metals &amp;c. though improperly, are ſaid to be boyled. For though they are not ſo ſoftned as things really Boylable: yet ſome of their moiſture is drawn forth, and communicated to the Water; which, the taſt the Water receives by their boyling in it, doth witneſs. Alſo boyling is attributed to a moiſt Body that hath little dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in it, as to milk, new Wine or Muſt, and other things, <hi>viz.</hi> When by boyling ſome parts of them do vapor away, and the remaining parts do receive ſome change in their temperament and taſt.</p>
                  <p>To boyling is oppoſed imperfect boyling,
<note place="margin">Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect boyling, what?</note> which is called <hi>Inquinatio</hi> and <hi>Flac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciditas,</hi> which is defined by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> to be, <hi>The Inconcoction of that which is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in a Body, by Reaſon of want of Heat in the moiſt thing which compaſſeth the ſame about.</hi> For this Inquination or Flaccidity, is properly nothing elſe but a boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling begun, <hi>viz.</hi> when the Heat which is in the Watry moiſture is indeed ſo great, that it can in ſome meaſure act upon the thing to be boyled: but is not ſo ſtrong, that it can perfectly Boyl the ſame, but either by cold or overmuch moiſture in the thing to be Boyled it is blunted and overcome, that it cannot perfect its work: which kind of imperfect Concoction oft happens in Aged and Sick People, whoſe Heat doth in ſome manner alter the meats, but cannot perfectly digeſt them.</p>
                  <p>The laſt ſort of Concoction, is <hi>Opteſis,</hi> roaſting;
<note place="margin">Roaſting what?</note> 
                     <hi>Which is a Concoction cauſed by a dry external Heat.</hi> For if in a mixt body the abounding humor be conſumed and tempered by a dry external Heat it is called a Rouſting. Now roaſt meats are without indeed dry, but within moiſt with a moiſture of their own, and more moiſt then boild meats themſelves. For the dry heat withers the external parts, and ſtraitens the pores, that the internal Humor can find no way out. Now roaſting and boyling are chiefly cauſed by Art, and theſe names do chiefly belong to them, as being becauſe Artificial beſt known to us. Yet the ſame things are alſo done by Nature. For the Concoction of Aliments in the bodies of Living Creatures, and eſpecially that in the Stomach, is boyling: alſo the ſame may not unfitly, in Hot and Dry Bodies, be called roaſting.</p>
                  <p>To roaſting alſo is oppoſed Seminſtulation, Toaſting, or raw-roaſting.
<note place="margin">Raw-Roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting.</note> Now had roaſting is cauſed through want of heat, which either is little of it ſelf, or not ſo great that it can poſſibly overcome a great aboundance of Humor, and therefore it perfects not the begun roaſting. <hi>And ſo much touching Concoctions.</hi>

<note place="margin">Mixt Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</note> And ſeeing that mixt Bodies are twofold, perfectly and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly mixed; and the imperfectly mixt are the Meteors: we muſt now come to that part of Natural Philoſophy, which all the Ancients (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his 1. <hi>B. Meteor. C.</hi> 1. <hi>tells us</hi>) called <hi>Meteorologia,</hi> the Doctrine of Meteors.</p>
                  <p>Later writers do here indeed raiſe a ſcruple, and ſome deny that a Body imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly mixed and a Meteor are one and the ſame thing; and they ſay the name of Meteor is of a larger extent, ſince there are many Meteors which are not Bodies, ſuch as thoſe things which happen only as an apparition as Thunder, Lightning, Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes: others again conceive that the term Meteor is only to be given to bodies imperfectly mixed, and therefore they exclude thoſe things as Thunder &amp;c. which have no ſubſiſtency, out of the Number of Meteors; ſince all things which make up the ſubject of Natural Phyloſophy, and are parts thereof, muſt be in the number of Natural Bodies. But this Controverſie may eaſily be compoſed. A Body imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly mixed muſt be ſomewhere explained in Natural Phyloſophy, and indeed moſt fitly next after the Elements: and therefore tis ſaid to be the ſubject of that part of Natural Phyloſophy. And ſeeing the ſame affords matter for Meteors, that part of Natural Phyloſophy is called <hi>Meteorologia,</hi> the Doctrine of Meteors. For though in it are alſo explained thoſe things which are not Natural Bodies, as hath been ſaid; yet thoſe very things are either the Adjuncts or Effects of Bodies im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly mixed. Hence uſe hath obtained, that under the term Meteor, both Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies imperfectly mixed and their Adjuncts and Effects ſhould be comprehended. And ſo the ſubject of this Doctrine is <hi>Meteoron</hi> a Meteor,
<note place="margin">A Meteor what it is?</note> that is, <hi>Somwhat raiſed out of the Earth and Water by force of the Stars and the under-ground Fire, and bred for the moſt part a loft in the Air.</hi> For the word <hi>Meteoron</hi> in general doth ſignifie a thing ſublime, Elevated, and hanging as it were up on high.</p>
                  <p>And by aloft or on high we underſtand, not the Heaven, but all that ſpace which reaches from Earth to Heaven, which place is called upwards, or above. Yea and ſince <hi>Meteoron</hi> ſignifies ſomwhat Elevated and ſuſpended on high, even thoſe thing alſo which are made in the Caverns of the Earth, of exhalations there raiſed up, are comprehended under this Name. For all things contained under this name are not of one kind, as hath been ſaid before. Hence ſome divide them into Hypoſtatical and Emphatical.
<note place="margin">The Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Meteors.</note> They are moſt conveniently diſtinguiſhed into three Ranks. For either the Nature of a Meteor conſiſts in the changing of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halation into ſome other thing, which happens in fiery Meteors, Rain and ſuch like; or in motion, as in Winds, Earth-quakes; or in the Reflexion of Beams, as in the Rain-bow.</p>
                  <p>Moſt do hold the efficient Cauſe to be Heaven,
<note place="margin">The Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe of meteors.</note> and the Heaven and the Sun are the chief cauſe which raiſes exhalations: but they are not the only cauſe, but hear
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:35070:61"/>alſo concurs and the ſubterranean fire; and in the Generation of Metals and Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals many exhalations are raiſed, as is known to thoſe that ſearch after Metals; and Winds and other Meteors are bred no leſs in the Winter, when the Sun beams are weak, then in the Summer.</p>
                  <p>The remote matter, are not only the four Elements,
<note place="margin">The matter</note> eſpecially the Earth and Water, but alſo mixt Bodies, out of which oppoſite exhalations are wont to be raiſed. The immediate matter is a twofold kind of exhalation, raiſed out of them being heated. For the Heavenly Bodies, eſpecially the Sun, and the Subterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an heat do excite and raiſe up a twofold kind of Exhalations: whereof the one which is termed <hi>Atmis,</hi> that is a vapor, is hot and moiſt, raiſed out of the Water or moiſt ground, being of as it were a middle Nature betwixt the water and Air, ſo that it may eaſily be changed into either Element. For it is moiſt in the higheſt degree, but heat is therein remiſs, and ſome degrees of coldneſs, or portions of Water car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried up therewith, do remaine in it; and as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaies in the 1 <hi>Met. Ch.</hi> 3. A Vapor is as it were potentially a Water. But the other Exhalation is called a Fume, or a Smoaky Exhalation; and it is Hot and Dry, raiſed out of the Earth, and eſpecially the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ier parts thereof, heated and attenuated by force of the ſtars; of a middle Nature as it were betwixt Fire and Earth. For this Exhalation is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding dry, and moderately hot; for it retains ſome degrees of the Earths cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or rather ſome parts of the Earth it ſelf Elevated with it. And therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the ſame place ſaies, that this Fume is potentially, as it were, Fire. Now there are chiefly two ſorts of Fumes, the one of which is termed <hi>Ecphlogoſis</hi> a flaming Fume, which is raiſed out of a Fat matter and is apt to take flame: another which is raiſed out of drier ground, and doth not ſo eaſily take Fire, but rather turns to Winds and Blaſts. Theſe two kinds of Exhalations though they are of a diſtinct Nature, and both in reſpect of their Heat, drineſs, Levity and Original differ one from another; (becauſe a vapor is Cold, Heavy, Moiſt, raiſed out of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but a Fume, Hot, Light, Dry, raiſed out of the Earth:) yet for the moſt part they are bred Joyntly, and both together, Becauſe in moſt places the Earth is mixed with Water: whereupon that which of its own Nature is Heavy, by help of the other lighter, is lifted up and raiſed on high; although when they come to the middle Region of the Air they are ſeparated, and the Fume is raiſed higher, but the vapor ſettles beneath. And theſe two Exhalations as they are commonly called are the matter of all Meteors; whence alſo it is that they are called Bodies imperfectly mixed; either becauſe they do not conſiſt of all the Elements, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in them the forms of the Elements are kept perfect and intire, and do not incorporate into the form of one mixt Body. For which Cauſe alſo ſuch kind of Bodies cannot long laſt. Yet it is wont many times to happen, that Atomes alſo of bodies perfectly mixed are mixed with theſe Exhalations; yet ſo as that theſe Exhalations are not informed by the forms of perfectly mixt Bodies, but only touch the ſaid mixt Bodies.</p>
                  <p>The place where Meteors are ingendred is chiefly the <hi>Air.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Place.</note> For it according to the divers Regions whereinto we have ſhewed it is divided, doth afford place to divers Meteors, as we ſhall afterwards declare. For even thoſe alſo which are ſaid to be ingendred in the Earth, are properly ingendred in the Aire contained in the caverns of the Earth. Howbeit in the Sphere of Fire, and eſpecially in the Loweſt part thereof, it muſt not be denied, but that Fiery Meteors are generated. Alſo upon theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the place and matter, depends the chief diſtinction of Meteors. For ſome conſiſt of an Exhalation, others of a vapor: ſome are produced in the upper, others in the lower Region of the Air. We ſhal begin with thoſe which ariſe from an Exhalation, and among them with thoſe which are commonly termed fiery and inflamed Meteors.</p>

                  <p>THe greateſt part of fiery Meteors are bred in the upmoſt Region of the Air. For when Hot and Dry Exhalations do aſcend thither and are there inflamed, ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry fiery Meteors are ingendred, which differ according to the various diſpoſition of the matter, the diverſity of inflammation, their magnitude, Figure, Motion and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:35070:62"/>Duration: of which though peradventure more ſorts might be reckoned up, whoſe Names are borrowed from the ſhapes which they repreſent in their burnings, yet I ſhall recount the chiefeſt of them. Now many reckon the <hi>Via Lactea</hi> and Comets amongſt fiery Meteors, but of them we have ſpoken before.</p>
                  <p>Alſo very many fiery Meteors do ariſe, differing only in the poſture of the matter, the multitude and ſhape they repreſent whiles they burn; which alſo are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained. And that we may begin here: if an Hot and Dry Exhalation, not very thick and Fat, but ſubtile, ſtretched out in length and breadth, do take fire in the upper Region of the Air,
<note place="margin">A burning flame how ingendred.</note> there appears a burning and ſhining <hi>Flame;</hi> ſomtimes with ſo much brightneſs, that it doth a little diſpel the darkneſs of the night. Some cal this Meteor, <hi>Burning ſtubble,</hi> for it repreſents heaps of ſtubble ſuddenly ſet on Fire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Skipping Goats</hi> ſo called,
<note place="margin">Skipping Goats.</note> do appear, when the Exhalation is drawn out in length rather then in bredth, having parts not equally diſpoſed, or diſtinct Maſſes, Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together by thin and rare Exhalations; or they have on the ſid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s certain threds as it were and briſtles annexed. For when this is inflamed, the Fire ſuddenly leaps, either out of the ſubtile and thin part of the Exhalation into another part thereof; or it runs out into the ſides and thoſe Briſtles or Appendixes aforeſaid, and by and by runs back again; and ſo it ſeems to dance, like Goats wantonly Skipping.</p>
                  <p>Burning Brands are,
<note place="margin">Burning brands.</note> when the exhalation is drawn out in like manner, rather in length then breadth, having its parts nevertheleſs equally diſpoſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For if this be ſet on Fire, it repreſents a burning Fire-brand or Beam. And theſe Beams do not move to and fro as Links or Torches, but are quiet, and ſhine in one and the ſame place.
<note place="margin">A burning Spear or Dart.</note> The <hi>burning Lance or Dart</hi> commonly ſo called, ſeems to be the ſame Meteor with the former. For by theſe Names a Meteor is deſigned, which is bred of an Exhalation or Fume, drawn out at length, and having parts of equal thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which being ſet on Fire doth burn all together, and ſhews the image of a Dart or ſpear.
<note place="margin">The bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Pillar</note> Nor doth the Perpendicular or Pyramidal Fire, ſo called, differ much from this, being ingendred of an Exhalation drawn out in Length, and Lighter in its upper part, Heavier in its lower. For being ſet on Fire in its upper and lighter part, it repreſents a Pillar ſet bolt upright; and its lower and heavier part reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the Baſis thereof.
<note place="margin">The Candle or Torch.</note> Like unto this is the <hi>burning Candle or Torch,</hi> Which conſiſts alſo of a dry Exhalation, drawn out in length alone, and equally thick. For this being inflamed at one end, and in ſome meaſure ſhining upon the other part not inflamed, it repreſents a burning Candle or Torch.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Running Stars,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Shooting Stars.</note> as <hi>Pliny</hi> in the 2. of his Natural Hiſtory, Cap. 37. calls them: the <hi>Courſing of Stars</hi> (as <hi>Seneca</hi> Phrazes it, in the 1. <hi>Book of his Nat. Queſt. Ch.</hi> 14.) Flying Stars as ſome cal them, and falling or ſhooting Stars, becauſe they appear in the ſhape of falling or flying Stars, do happen two manner of waies. Firſt of all hen an exhalation in the upmoſt Region of the Air, drawn out in length, is torn, diſtinguiſhed and ſpred abroad into many particles as it were. For the firſt part being inflamed doth ſpeedily communicate the Fire to the other, the Second to the Third, the Third to the Fourth, &amp;c. After the ſame manner as one Candle lighted doth eaſily light again another newly blown out; and ſo it makes ſhew of a ſhooting Star. Again, when an Exhalation ſubſiſts in the middle Region of the Air, and either by Antiperiſtaſis of the cold Air is inflamed, made lighter and ſo raiſed on high, and ſhews like a flying Star; or being by the coldneſs of a cloud compreſſed and Squeezed, it conceives Fire, and moves downwards, for the moſt part ſide long, and violently; and then a Star ſeems to fall from Heaven. Alſo a third manner may be added, <hi>viz.</hi> When an Exhalation drawn out in length, of equal thickneſs, and apt to burn, is ſet on Fire. For this burning all on a ſudden, and the flame ſpeedily paſſing from one part to another, it makes the appearance of a ſhooting or flying Star. For we muſt not give credit to the dotage of the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureans,</hi> who taught, that Stars did really fall from Heaven. For, to uſe the words of <hi>Seneca,</hi> in <hi>L.</hi> 1. <hi>Queſt. Nat. Cap.</hi> 1. if this were true, there would have been ere now no Stars left in the Heaven. For there is no Night wherein many ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Stars appear not. And yet the Stars of Heaven appear in the ſame place they were in before. They are all as big as before. When many ſhooting Stars appear,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:35070:62"/>they foretell Winds to follow. For they argue ſtore of dry Exhalations which are matter for Winds: whereof <hi>Virgil</hi> in the 1. <hi>Book of his Georgicks or Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry:</hi>
                     <q>

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Flying Dragon</hi> is ingendred in the middle Region of the Air.
<note place="margin">The flying Dragon.</note> Now this Meteor is made, when an Exhalation not too clammy and hot, meets with a cold Cloud, and is thereby driven back, and ſo either by motion or by <hi>Antipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtaſis;</hi> in its upper part, where it is lighter, it is ſet on Fire, and ſeems to vomit Flames and Sparkles; but in its middle part where it is Thicker, and is bowed, it Repreſents a Belly: and in its lower part which is Narrower and Straiter, it Reſembles a Taile.</p>
                  <p>In the loweſt region of the Aire is ingendred the <hi>Ignis fatuus,
<note place="margin">Willy with the Wiſpe, or Peg with the Lanthorne.</note> or Willie with the Wiſpe,</hi> near fat and moiſt ſoiles, pooles, Church-yards, places of Publique Execution where Malefactors are buried, where are ſtore of clammy and fat Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations. For they being ſet on Fire, either by <hi>antiperiſtaſis</hi> of the cold Aire of the night, or by motion, do appear like burning candles, and are diverſly moved according to the motion of the Air; and therefore they are called walking lights, and ſometimes they ſeeme to go before a Man, and then again to follow him. For when ſuch as travel in the night would come to theſe Fires,

Theſe Fires do many times draw Travellers out of their way, and make them fall into Ditches, Quag-mires, and Rivers: becauſe way faring people, ſuppoſing that theſe Fires are Candles ſhining in the next Villages, do make to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, and leaving the right way fall head-long into the next Rivers and Pooles they come at; Or by theſe Fires being generated about Watry Places, and there ſeeking their Nouriſhment, they are ſeduced into the ſaid Waters. And it is hardly to be denyed, nevertheleſs, but that ſomtimes the fraudulent Illuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Devil doth concur in the Caſe, Who continualy ſtudies the Deſtruction of Man kind, and ſeeks al occaſions to do harm.</p>
                  <p>Alſo of a light Exhalation in the ſame manner are Bred theſe <hi>Meteors</hi> called <hi>Helena, Caſtor and Pollux,</hi> which are wont commonly to be ſeene of <hi>Marirers</hi> at ſea, in the time of a tempeſt: and if two appear, they are called <hi>Caſtor and Pollux;</hi> if one alone, 'tis called <hi>Helena:</hi> and one is counted unlucky, but two a ſigne of faire weather. For ſo <hi>Plinie Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Nat. Hiſt. C.</hi> 37. <hi>Theſe Stars are of grievous importance, if they come ſingle, and drown the ſhips, and if they fall into the Hole, they burne them up. But if they come two together they are good Signs and tokens of a proſperous voyage, by whoſe coming they ſay the direfull and threatning Helena is chaſed away: and therefore they attribute this Divinity to Gaſtor and Pollux,</hi> and ſet their Images on the Ship ſterne as turelary Deities whom they invoke at Sea; as may be ſeen in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles, <hi>Ch.</hi> 28. <hi>v.</hi> 11. But theſe things are taken rather from Heatheniſh ſuperſtitions then phyſical Cauſes. That appears more true, that when theſe <hi>Meteors</hi> are moved up and down with an unſtable motion, they foreſhew Winds and Tempeſts; and when in the time of a Tempeſt they fall down into the Ships, or ſtick to the Maſts, they are a ſign of faire wether and a Calme. For now they ſignifie that the blaſts of the Winds and the Tempeſts do abate. Howbeit concerning the Star <hi>Helena,</hi> thus <hi>Cardan</hi> writes <hi>in his</hi> 2 <hi>B. of Subtilties P.</hi> 69. Of the ſame kind wellnear is the Star of <hi>Helen</hi> about the Maſt of a Ship, which when it falls melts even Braſs-Kettles, and is a certain Sign of Ship-wrack.

And therefore ſome deny that they are alwaies to be referred to Natural Cauſes. That is a Remarkable Paſſage related by <hi>Cardan;</hi> that a Certain Man came home to his Houſe after one a Clock in the Night, and when he put off his Cloake, a Sparkle flew from the Cape thereof; and when he tooke his Cloake againe and laid it off, it Sparkled againe, ſo that he was double affrighted; and within 15 Daies he was by his Enemies accuſed of Witch-craft, and ſought for, to be tormented and puniſhed: but by the advice of his Friends He underwent a voluntary baniſhment.</p>
                  <p>Alſo from the ſame dry Exhalation <hi>Thunder Lightning and Thunder-bolts</hi> do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe.
<note place="margin">How thunder Cauſed.</note> Touching <hi>Thunder</hi> there are ſundry Opinons of the Ancients, as we may ſee in <hi>Ariſtotle, L.</hi> 2. <hi>Meteor. C.</hi> 9. Plutarch <hi>de placit. Phyloſoph. Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. Seneca <hi>in Quaeſt. nat. Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 17.18. &amp;c. Lucretius. <hi>Lib.</hi> 6. Nor are late writers of the ſame judgement concerning the ſame. For <hi>Bodinus</hi> conceives that Thunder and moſt other Meteors, do not ariſe from Natural Cauſes, but rather from the Power of God, or the Divel. <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> whoſe Opinion is thought to be more probable then the Reſt, doth conceive that Thunders are thus generated: When a twofold Exhalation hot and drie, is raiſed together, and thickned into a round Cloud in the middle Region of the Air: and the Cloud being thickned by Reaſon of the coldneſs of the place, neſpecially in the upper part thereof, and the hot Exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation being ſhut up therein, and beſieged on all ſides by the cold, it ſights with the cold, and ſeeking an egreſs, it runs this way and that way, ſhaking the ſides thereof; or alſo breaking through the ſame it makes that noiſe which we call Thunder. An Example whereof is ſeen in Guns; when the fiery ſpirit, proceeding from the Coale-Sulphury Nitre, (to uſe the words of <hi>Scaliger</hi> in <hi>Exe. citat.</hi> 11. <hi>Sect.</hi> I.) cannot be contained in the Room it was in when it was Gun powder, it vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently ſeeks its paſſage, and ſuddenly breaks out, making a noiſe like Thunder. Which happens alſo in Wood and Cheſt-Nuts, when they are put into the Fire, containing in them a hot Expiration. For the ſaid Exhalation being rarified, and not finding a place to containe it ſelf, it breaks out of the wood and Cheſtnuts with a Noiſe.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit Chymical Operations do afford light to this Doctrine,
<note place="margin">Chymical operations declare the generation of thunder</note> which do not only declare the Cauſe of Thunder more particularly &amp; clearly; but alſo ſhew that the aforeſaid Noiſe is cauſed not only by the matter ſhut up and ſeeking an Egreſs, but alſo by the ſudden breaking of the Air, cauſed by the Motion of Bodies, mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally abhorring and flying one from another. For by the aforeſaid Operations it is eaſie to ſee, that as oft as a part of inflamed Sulphur is added to Nitre, a mighty Noiſe is Cauſed. Which alſo is to be ſeen in Gun-powder, and in that Preparation of Nitre, which they call <hi>Sal Pruneliae.</hi> Nor doth the common ſulphur only worke this Effect: but the Sulphur alſo of Minerals and Metals, when Nitre is added thereto, as appears in the Calcination of Antimony with Nitre: but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in <hi>Aurum Fulminans,</hi> or Thundering Gold, ſo called, which being ſet on Fire, ſtrikes with greater force and Noiſe then Gun-powder, only it moves downwards. Nor is it unknown, that of Nitre, Sulphur, Quick Lime, and Bitumen mixtures
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:35070:63"/>are made, which being ſprinkled with moiſture, or wet with ſpittle only, are ſet on fire. Now that force depends not on Sulphure alone, or Nitre alone, but on both mixed together. Sulphur indeed quickly takes flame, but burns ſlowly: but Nitre is not eaſily inflamed, but being once ſet on Fire, it burns quickly away and in a moment as it were. And therefore it is from Sulphur that Gun-powder ſo ſoon takes Fire; but that it burns up ſo ſuddenly proceeds from Nitre, and all the force thereof proceeds from the ſaid Nitre. From whence it is not hard to judg of the Generation of Thunder. For when in the Summer time Sulphutous and Nitrous Vapors are inviſibly raiſed up by the heat of the Sun, eſpecially when the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winds blow; and afterwards either by the oppoſite Winds, or by the coldneſs of the middle Region they are united and condenſed, it comes to paſs, that they are there inflamed, and hence proceeds the Thunder and Lightning.</p>
                  <p>Whence it appears,
<note place="margin">Thunder may alſo be made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Clouds</note> that it is not altogether untrue that Thunder or ſomwhat like it may be alſo made without clouds. For Hiſtories witneſs that Thunders have been heard the Sky being clear: and <hi>Pliny</hi> relates <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 51. That there was a man ſmitten with a Thunder Bolt, on a clear day; and other have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the ſame. Which Thunders may wel be thought to have been bred of a ſpirit and a dry Exhalation, contained in the Caverns of the Earth, and breaking out with great violence. Which thing is made more credible by what <hi>Seneca</hi> relates, <hi>Queſt. Nat. Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>C.</hi> 30. after this manner: Once upon a time <hi>Aetna</hi> was ful of fire: it poured forth an Ocean of burning Sand. All the daylight was darkend with duſt, and the People were frighted by the ſuddain approach of night. At the ſame time tis reported there were very many Thundrings and lightnings: which were cauſed by the concourſe of dry bodies, and not of clouds; for it is not credible there were any clouds, the Air being ſo burning hot.</p>
                  <p>Alſo concerning Lightning there is ſome diverſity of opinions,
<note place="margin">Lightning what it is?</note> as may be ſeen out of the places fore alleadged. Moſt retain the Opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who held that Lightning was an hot Exhalation driven out of a cloud, and ſet on Fire chiefly by vehement motion, and caſting forth a ſhining Light.</p>
                  <p>And although the Thunder be before or as ſoon as the Lightning,
<note place="margin">Why the Lightning is ſeen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the thunder is heard?</note> yet the Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is ſeen before the Thunder is heard; <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe the ſight is quicker then the hearing, and viſible repreſentations of things are more ſpiritual, and more fit for ſudden propagation, then audible. An example whereof we have likewiſe in ſuch as cleave Trees in the Woods, where we ſee the blow light, before we hear the ſound. And in Guns, where we Firſt ſee the Fire before we hear the Report.</p>
                  <p>A Thunder-bolt differs not much from Lightening;
<note place="margin">A thunder bolt.</note> for it is an Hot and Dry Exhalation, more compact then Lightning, ſuddenly breaking out of the Clouds with great force and violence. And therefore it is not alwaies diſperſed in the Air, as moſt other fiery Meteors are, but is carried often to the Earth: both becauſe it is darted out of the Cloud with great force and violence, as alſo becauſe it conſiſts of a matter well compact and cleaving together: yet <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us (in his <hi>Nat. Hiſt. Book</hi> 2. <hi>Ch.</hi> 55.) that it never ſinks into the Earth above Five foot. Hence <hi>Seneca</hi> in <hi>Queſt. Nat. Book</hi> 3. <hi>Ch.</hi> 57. <hi>Lightning which only ſhines, and the Thunder-bolt which is darted down, are made after the ſame manner. But the former is of leſs force, and hath leſs nutriment. And to ſay what I think in a word: a Thunder-bolt is Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning compact and Vigorated.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That theſe things may be explained from nearer principles:
<note place="margin">The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thunder-bolt decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from Chymical Principles.</note> the Lightning and Thunder-bolt differ only in the diſpoſition and plenty of the Sulphur and Nitre. For the more plentiful and ſubtile the Nitre is; ſo much more vehement is the blow: and becauſe of the aboundance of Sulphur, there is more appearance of fire. Hence a Cauſe may be rendred why it lightens ſomtimes with Thunder and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times without. For the reaſon hereof is not, becauſe the Cloud is ſpungy or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, ſomtimes ſtopping the paſſage of the Exhalation, and other whiles giving the ſame a free Egreſs: (for the Clouds are not ſo thick as to be able to ſtop in the Lightning:) but becauſe there is ſomtimes good ſtore of Nitre, other whiles but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle joyned with the Sulphurous Exhalation; therefore ſomtimes vehement Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, other whiles little or none is heard.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Thunder-Bolt</hi> therefore is a fiery and thin Nitro Sulphureous ſpirit, and not a ſtone as the common people imagin. For the wonderful power and force of the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:35070:64"/>Thunder-bolt, of which we ſhall ſpeak anon, muſt not be aſcribed to a ſtone, but to a Body much more thin and ſubtile. And if any man will hold, that a moſt ſolid Stone may ſomtimes be bred in the Clouds of Exhalations thickned and coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated, and be caſt down with the Thunder-bolt or Lightning as a bullet ſhot out of a Gun, I ſhall not contend with him; yet I think ſuch a thing happens but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                  <p>I conceive it comes more frequently to paſs, that by reaſon of a Thunder-bolt falling upon the Earth, the ſame and what ever matter is apt thereto, is melted as it were by Fire, and out of that fluid matter ſuch a ſtone is formed; ſince it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a well known thing, that Iron and other Metals may be ſuddenly melted with a Thunder-bolt.</p>
                  <p>The Effects of Thunder-bolts are wonderful.
<note place="margin">The effects of thunder bolts.</note> For by it Silver hath been melted in mens Purſes, and the Purſes no way hurt or harmed: the ſword hath been mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Scabbard remaining intire; all the Iron hath melted and run down a Poſt, the Wood unhurt; the Bones in live Creatures have been maſhed to pieces and the fleſh not toucht; and <hi>Martia</hi> a Roman Lady had the Child in her Womb kild with a Thunder-bolt, her ſelf unhurt, as <hi>Pliny</hi> tels us in his <hi>Hiſt.

The Cauſe whereof <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaies to be (3. <hi>Metor.</hi>) becauſe it ſooner goes through light and Spungy Bodies, then to be able to hurt or burn them. But in ſuch things as are thicker, while it ſtaies a little ſeeking a paſſage which it cannot eaſily find, it doth the more hurt.

<note place="margin">The moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a thunder-bolts.</note> diſputes againſt the aſſertion of <hi>Cardan</hi> touching the Hyacinth. The motion of Thunder-bolts is commonly aſlope or ſlanting: becauſe the Fire of its own Nature tends upwards, and the force whereby it is caſt out of the cloud drives it downwards. And hence a cauſe may be rendred, why Thunder-bolts do fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſmite high Mountains, Towers, Temples, Tall-Trees: becauſe ſeeing Thunder-bolts are commonly moved aſlant, the higheſt things are moſt Obvious to them, and are therefore more often hurt by them</p>

Yet later writers ſay they are moſt frequent in Summer, and ſeldom in the Spring and Autumn; and to their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion experience gives witneſs in our parts; for the hotter the weather, the more Lightnings, Thunders and Thunder-bolts we have. For in great Heats very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not Exhalations are raiſed a loft, fit to ingender Thunder-bolts, and through the cold of the middle Region of the Air they are ſhut up in Clouds, and out of them violently driven down.</p>
                  <p>As to the difference of Thunder-bolts,
<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of thunder-bolts.</note> 
                     <hi>Pliny</hi> divides them (in 2. <hi>Book Ch.</hi> 43.) into Predicting and Brute, perſwaded rather by Heatheniſh Superſtition then any Natural Reaſon. That is a more convenient diviſion of Thunder-bolts, which <hi>Seneca</hi> brings in his 2. <hi>B. of Natural Queſtions, Ch.</hi> 40. The kinds of Thunder-bolts (ſaies he) are the Borer, the diſſipater, the Burner. That which bores is ſubtile and flamy, flies through the ſtraireſt paſſages, by reaſon of the ſincere thinneſs and pureneſs of the flame. That which diſſipates is conglobated, and hath mixt with it the force of a fiery and ſtormy ſpirit. And therefore that kind of Thunder-bolt returns and eſcapes through that hole where it entred in. The force of this Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-bolt being ſpred far abroad breaks what it ſmites, but doth not pierce through it. The third kind, which burns, hath much Earthineſs in it, and is more
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:35070:64"/>fiery then flaming. And therefore it leaves great marks of burning which abide in the things ſmitten. Indeed, No Thunder-bolt comes without Fire, but we call this properly fiery, which imprints manifeſt ſigns of burning. That which burns and makes brown, doth burn three manner of waies: for either it blaſts only and hurts ſlightly, or it burns, or it kindles.</p>
                  <p>To the Meteors whoſe Nature and Generation hath been Hitherto explained,
<note place="margin">Strange Colors in the Skie, and Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings.</note> may not unconveniently be adjoyned the <hi>Phaſmata</hi> ſo called, ſuch as are, wide gapings in the Skies, Ditches, Bloody redneſs and other Colors in the Skies appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. For theſe appear various by reaſon of the light of Stars or Meteors received in a thick Air, or Exhalations, differing in plenty, Denſity, and Poſition. For as a flame appears in ſundry Colors, by reaſon of the various permiſtion of Fire and Smoak: even ſo the light of the Stars or Exhalations enflamed, according to the divers diſpoſitions of the matter wherein it is received, doth preſent to our Eyes ſundry Colors and Shapes. For when that which receives the light is very compact and dark, there appears ſomwhat that is obſcure and darkiſh; if it be not ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, there is an appearance of a Sky Color; if yet leſs compact, it appears purple Color'd.
<note place="margin">A Gaping.</note> And therefore they ſay a Gaping in the Sky is cauſed two manner of wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es. Firſt, When the light of the Moon, or another Star, or of ſome Exhalation enflamed (which is I conceive the more frequent cauſe) falls into a Cloud beneath it; which is compact in the middle, and ſpungy in the ſides. For ſo the thicker part in the middle, which the Light cannot pierce into, expreſſes a certain deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs remote from us a great way: but in the outmoſt parts through which the light paſſes, it ſeems nearer to us. For every thing that is black, dark and obſcure, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be as near as that which is white, yet it ſeems further off then it: for white things do more work upon the ſight. And therefore painters alſo being to expreſs a thing depreſſed and remote, do uſe a black Color or that which is near to black; but to expreſs a thing raiſed and eminent, they uſe white.
<note place="margin">Ditches &amp; other fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures and colors ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing.</note> After the ſame manner alſo Ditches are made. For in them there is only more depth, then in the foreſaid Gapings. Of other Colors and Figures appearing in the Air, the Cauſe is the ſame. For according to the various diſpoſition of Clouds in their ſeveral parts, in reſpect of thickneſs and thinneſs, the ſhapes of divers Animals are repreſented, of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, &amp;c. They ſay that a Caping is made after a ſecond manner, when a thin ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halation burns above ſome Cloud, and attenuates the ſaid Cloud in the middle, more and more, ſo that it ſeems to be divided into two parts. Which being done, the Exhalation it ſelf appears all on Fire, and the Heaven being as it were opened, ſeems to burn. Yet probable it is that ſomtimes ſuch Prodigious Apparitions are by almighty God placed in the Sky, to Denounce ſome Impendent Calamity, and Experience teaches as much.</p>

                  <p>AFter the Fiery Mercors, we are to treat of Winds and Earth-Quakes. Now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though of old ſundry Men have had ſeveral opinions concerning the Nature of the Winds; and that Opinion chiefly was moſt Famous and common,
<note place="margin">Wind is not the Air agitated.</note> which holds that Wind is the Agitation of the Air, or as <hi>Seneca</hi> defines it, <hi>Queſt. Nat. Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Cap.</hi> 1.

<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Wind according to</hi> Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</note> But <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf held thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Generation of the Winds; that all the Water which falls down in ſhowers is totally diſtributed into the Earth, and the Earth hath in it ſelf much heat and Fire; and the Sun doth not only draw that moiſture which lies in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per parts of the Earth, but alſo by its heating Faculty dries the Earth it ſelf; which Humor being drawn a loft in vapors, is driven back by the coldneſs of the middle Region of the Air, and agitated and moved athwart.</p>
                  <p>For the Matter of Winds, according to the <hi>Ariſtoteleans,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Wind</note> is an Exhalation hot and dry: of which thing they produce theſe ſignes. For in the firſt place Winds do very much dry. Again as <hi>Cardan</hi> ſaies in his 16. <hi>de Subtil. p.</hi> 792. (and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence confirmes the ſame,) red Clouds ſcattered all over the Sky, or a red Moon, or the Suns ſetting amongſt red Clouds; ſignifies Winds to follow; only becauſe they
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:35070:65"/>argue that many Hot and Dry Exhalations are Elevated into the Sky. Howbeit the matter of Winds is ſeldom a pure Exhalation; and ſome winds are drier then other ſome, becauſe two ſorts of Exhalations, as was ſaid before, are commonly drawn joyntly out of the Earth; and again, becauſe they are mixed with Exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Vapors, through which they paſs: and therefore alſo the Qualities of ſeveral Winds are different, as ſhal afterwards appear, by reaſon of the vapors they bring with them out of the places through which they blow.</p>
                  <p>Now what ſhould be the Cauſe of the Motion and Agitation of Winds,
<note place="margin">The Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe.</note> authors differ, as may be ſeen in <hi>Franciſe. Piccolhomineus, Lib. de Meteor. Ch.</hi> 22. <hi>Collegium Conimbric. de Meteoris, Tract.</hi> 6. <hi>C.</hi> 3. And verily here is no ſmal difficulty and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity. But moſt Men hold, that dry Exhalations being carried up to the middle Region of the Air, or thereabouts, are by the coldneſs thereof driven back; and becauſe by their own Nature they are light and endeavor to mount upwards (but by the violence of the cold Air they are driven down again,) therefore they are forced to move Athwart or Croſs the Air. For juſt as Smoak aſcending out of a Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, if it meet with Wind is beaten down, and paſſes obliquely this way and that way al abroad: ſo they think it no abſurdity to ſay, that an hot Exhalation mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the coldneſs of the middle Region of the Air, is driven back there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
                  <p>Now as we do not wholly reject this opinion,
<note place="margin">Ariſtotles <hi>opinion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined.</hi>
                     </note> ſince experience it ſelf doth wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that after Rains Winds are raiſed in the neighbouring places, vapors being raiſed out of the Earth moiſtened with ſhowers; yet ſome things are to be added and obſerved concerning the ſame. For firſt, though that ſame violent motion of Winds be chiefly to be attributed to Exhalations: yet the Air it ſelf doth encreaſe that motion, which being moved by the Exhalations is it ſelf agitated, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly carried this way and that way. Even as when it is moved by ones Hand, by a Whip, or Fann, we perceive it makes ſomwhat which reſembles Wind.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, although Winds are hardly bred without an Hot and Dry Exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, ſince rarely one kind of exhalation aſcends without another: yet nothing hinders but that Cold and moiſt Vapors may be the matter of Winds; and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience teaches us that there are many cold Winds, and many Winds moiſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, 'Tis indeed credible, that out of the Earth moiſtened with ſhowers many Exhalations do aſcend; but Credible it is not, that all the matter of Winds ariſes from the ſurface of the Earth, and that the Earth within the compaſs of ten Foot deep, more or leſs, can ſend forth ſuch ſtore of Vapors as will ſerve to make Winds, which oftentimes out of the ſame Quarters do moſt vehemently blow, divers daies together; eſpecially when the Earth continues moiſt even when the Winds do blow: but without all queſtion the greateſt part of Winds do break out of the hollow Caverns of the Earth. For in the Winter Seaſon, when all the Surface of the Earth is hardned with Froſt and Cold, yet nevertheleſs more and more vehement Winds are then raiſed, then in the Summer time; and Winds ariſe out of Rivers and Lakes, yea and Storms ariſe out of the Sea it ſelf. And although ſome think it improbable, that Winds are raiſed out of the bottom of the Water, by the working of the Fire which is in the Bowels of the Earth, yet Mariners have oftentimes found it ſo to be, to their great danger and dammage. For this is that <hi>Aeolia</hi> (which <hi>Virgil</hi> deſcribes in his 1. Book of the Travels of <hi>Aeneas,</hi>) out of which, as he ſaies,
<q>
                        <l>Huf-puf Winds make all to an Head, and where the Gate's open,</l>
                        <l>Out they Ruſh, with a bluſtring blaſt, and Blow the Land over.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Although I will not now diſpute this point, whether Vapors and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations raiſed aloft, are driven back by the coldneſs of the middle Region: yet nevertheleſs certain it is, that they when they break out of the Caverns of the Earth, they are not deſtitute of all force and motion; and that not only an Air ariſes out of Pools, Floods and lakes, but even out of the Calm Sea oftentimes ſtorms of Wind do ariſe. Now the Winds in the mean while do receive this force at that time, either from the multitude of Waters which break into the bowels of the Earth, and thruſt forth the Air and Vapors there ſhut up; or from the Fire contained in
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:35070:65"/>the Caverns of the Earth, and reſolving the Waters and other ſubject matter into Vapors: to which may be added ſome Huge Fragment of Earth falling down into ſome vaſt Cavern of the Earth, and thereout violently expelling the Air. Howbeit, amongſt theſe Cauſes, the chief ſeems to be the under-ground heat; and many things argue that it is no leſs effectual to raiſe Winds, then the Heat of the Sun. For, as hath been lately ſaid, they break out of Rivers, Lakes, and the Sea alſo in the Winter time, when the ſurface of the Earth is hard with Froſt. And that ſame inſtrument which Chymiſts uſe inſtead of bellows to blow their Fire, doth not a little declare this buſineſs. They have a round hollow Globe of Copper, which being filled with Water and cloſe ſtopped, there is a ſmal hole on one ſide or a Pipe with a ſmal paſſage: and the ſaid Globe being filled with Water is laid on a Chaſing Diſh of Coals, and the foreſaid Pipe is inſtead of bellows turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Fire which they would blow: when the Globe grows Hot and the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter begins to rariſie, there is a perpetual Wind blowing forth, which blows the foreſaid Fire like a bellows, til all the Water in the Globe be conſumed. To all which cauſes nevertheleſs one ſeems fit to be added, <hi>viz.</hi> The contrariety of thoſe ſmal particles, whereof the Exhalations which are the matte. of Winds do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For theſe particles (as appears by many Chymical operations, wherein for the ſame cauſe the Veſſels are violently broken, while they abhor and fly one from ther) do raiſe ſuch a violent motion.</p>
                  <p>Howbert, The motion and poſture likewiſe of the Stars, and eſpecially of the Planets, doth alſo contribute to the Generation of exhalations; which being in this or that part of Heaven conſtituted, or in conjunction with others, or having mutual aſpects; they move ſomtimes this matter, ſomtimes that, ſomtimes in one place, ſomtimes in another, and varioutly drive and force the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The number of the Winds is by various Authors variouſly reckoned,
<note place="margin">The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Winds vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</note> as may be ſeen in <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in his 2. <hi>of Meteors, Ch.</hi> 6. in the Author of the <hi>Book de Mundo</hi> dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to <hi>Alexander</hi> Ch. 4. <hi>Seneca</hi> in his <hi>Queſt.

Who alſo differ ſomwhat in the Names and Situations of the Winds. Thus we ſhal Muſter them. All grant that thoſe are the four Cardinal or Principal Winds, which blow from the four Principal points of the Horizon, or the four corners of the World. For from the Equinoctial Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe blows the Eaſt-Wind; from the Noone-ſted blows the South-Wind; From the Equinoctial Sun-ſet, the Weſt-Wind; and from the Pole Arctick blows the North-wind. The Ancients contented themſelves with the notice of theſe four Winds: the Age following added four more. For, becauſe the Sun doth not alwaies riſe and ſet in the ſame place, but the Equinoctial Sun-Riſe and Sun-ſet from whence the Eaſt and Weſt winds blow, are different from the Solſtitial Sun-Riſe and Sun-ſet; and the Winter Sun-Riſe and Sun-Set is alſo different from them: they ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore added yet four Winds more, blowing from the four points of the Interfection of the Tropicks and Horizon, or from the points of the Summer Sun-Riſe and Sun-Set, and the Winter Sun-Riſe and Sun-Set. For that which blows from the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Sun-Riſe, they called <hi>Caecias;</hi> That from the Winter Sun-Riſe <hi>Vulturnus;</hi> that which blows from the Summer Sun-Set, <hi>Corus;</hi> that from the Winter Sun-Set, <hi>Africus.</hi> To theſe Poſterity added yet other four, which blow from the Poles of the Zodiack, and their oppoſite points; or from the ſides of the Poles and the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Circles, or from the points marked by them in the Horizon; ſo that every Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Wind came to have two collateral or ſide winds. And they called that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the North and the Summer Sun-Riſe <hi>Thraſcias;</hi> and that betwixt the South and Winter Sun Set, <hi>Libonotus;</hi> that betwixt the South and Winter Sun-Riſe, <hi>Phaenicias.</hi> And this is the moſt uſual number of Winds among Authors.
<note place="margin">The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the winds en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by late Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gators.</note> Later Navigators have amplified the number of the Winds to thirty two. For they divide the Horizon into eight parts, to which they attribute eight Winds; which they call principal, <hi>viz</hi> thoſe which blow from the four cardinal points of the Horizon, or corners of the World, and ſuch as blow from the points exactly in the middle of thoſe. To theſe they add eight others, holding the middle places betwixt the principal, and call them the middle or half Winds: to theſe they add ſixteen more, which they inſert in the middle ſpace betwixt the principal and the middle, and cal them Intermediate or Quarter Winds.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>To theſe if we ſhall add eight and inſert them in the middle among the principal, (which were alſo uſed by the Ancients, and blow from the Summer and Winter Sun-Riſe and Sun-Set, and which the ſailers call middlewinds of half Winds,) we ſhal then have ſixteen Winds worthy of obſervation. For betwixt the Eaſt and the South-Eaſt there is <hi>Vulturnus,</hi> or the Eaſt-South-Eaſt Wind; betwixt the South-Eaſt and the South there is <hi>Phaemcias,</hi> or the South-South-Eaſt Wind; betwixt the South and the South-Weſt there is the <hi>Libonotus,</hi> the South-South Weſt wind; betwixt the South-Weſt and the Weſt there is <hi>Africus,</hi> the Weſt-South-Weſt wind, betwixt the Weſt and the North-Weſt is the <hi>Caurus, Corus,</hi> or Weſt-North-Weſt wind; betwixt the North-Weſt and the North blows the <hi>Circius</hi> or North-North Weſt wind; betwixt the North and the North-Eaſt blows <hi>Boreas, Aquilo,</hi> or the North-North-Eaſt wind; betwixt the North Eaſt and the Eaſt blows the <hi>Caecias,</hi> or the Eaſt-North-Eaſt-wind.</p>
                  <p>The chief thing obſerveable in theſe Winds is the contruriety.
<note place="margin">Coatrary winds.</note> Now thoſe Winds are moſt contrary one to another which are moſt diſtant one from another in place. Now thoſe are moſt diſtant in place which are Diametrically oppoſite one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or by a Line drawn through the Centre of the Horizon. Hence the Eaſt is oppoſed to the Weſt, the South to the North; the Winter Sun-Riſe to the Summer Sun-Set, the Winters Sun-Set to the Summers Sun-Riſe: and therefore the Winds alſo which blow from theſe parts are oppoſite one to another. So the Eaſt-South-Eaſt wind is oppoſite to the Weſt-North-Weſt; the South-Eaſt wind to the North-Weſt; the South-South-Eaſt, to the North-North-Weſt; South-South-Weſt to the North-North-Eaſt; the North-Eaſt to the South-Weſt; the Eaſt-North-Eaſt wind is oppoſite to the Weſt-South Weſt wind.</p>
                  <p>And here it is to be obſerved,
<note place="margin">The winds blow in a certaine Method.</note> that theſe winds obſerve a Rule in blowing. Thoſe which are contrary, becauſe they are Diametrically oppoſite, cannot blow at one and the ſame time, but the ſtronger of the two ſuppreſſes the force of its oppoſite: or if it happen that they blow together, it is with mighty contention and cauſes an hideous ſtorme. Now, this order the winds do commonly obſerve, that when one fals that which is next it doth riſe; or the contrary to that which ceaſes doth begin to blow. Moreover in contrary Lines contrary Winds do for the moſt part blow: concerning which ſee <hi>Ariſtotle, Lib. Meteor.</hi> 2. <hi>C.</hi> 6.

                        </gap> of the winds.</note> Here is to be noted the Temperament and Quality of the Winds. For though they al agree in matter, and conſiſt of an hot and dry Exhalation: yet ſince that is ſeldom raiſed up alone, (but that for the moſt part out of the Sea and the Earth watered with Rains and Snows theſe two Exhalations are drawn together, &amp; afford matter to the Winds;) moreover that they paſs through places Hot, Cold, Dry; therfore there is alſo a great difference of Winds in reſpect of the places from whence they ariſe and through which they blow. For the Winds have not only the Qualities of thoſe places from whence they ariſe, but their chief qualities they have from the places through which they paſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his <hi>Book de Aere, Aqua, &amp; Locis,</hi> divides al the Winds into Hot and Cold, becauſe the force of theſe qualities is greateſt: whom <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> following in his 2. <hi>Meteor. Cap.</hi> 6. divides all Winds into North and South Winds, even in reſpect of Heat and Cold alſo. To the Northern he adds the Weſtern Winds, and to the Southern the Eaſtern. The North-Winds are the coldeſt of all other and Dry, for they ariſe from Snowy cold places, and paſs through places out of the Sun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> way and far from the Heat thereof. With theſe agree the Weſt Winds. For theſe are cold Winds, becauſe they paſs through places not much heated by the Sun. To the North-Wind the South-wind is oppoſed, an hot wind, which paſſes
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:35070:66"/>through the Suns road, and through places heated by the Sun: in <hi>Libya</hi> indeed it is dry, becauſe the moiſt vapors are there conſumed by the Sun: but to us it is moiſt, becauſe it comes over the Mediterranean or Mid-land Sea. The Eaſtern Winds are Hot and dry. For the Sun is carried long over thoſe places through which they come.</p>
                  <p>The Eaſt-wind is Hot, Dry, temperate, Sweet, Pure, Subtile, Healthy, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the morning: and therefore it brings no Venemeus blaſts. The Eaſt-South-Eaſt becauſe nearer the South is moiſt and cloudy, and therefore when it blows all things do ſeem to be bigger then indeed they are, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath it in the 26. <hi>Section</hi> of his <hi>Problems, Problem</hi> 56. The Eaſt-North-Eaſt, is inconſtant and ſomwhat cool. It drives not the Clouds away, but draws them to it ſelf; whence the Proverb: he draws evils to himſelf as the Eaſt Nor-Eaſt Wind draws the Clouds. The Weſt wind melts the Winter Snow and Froſts, being of an Hot and moiſt temper, making the Herbs and flowers to grow; and therefore 'tis thought to have its Name in the Greek <hi>Zephuros,</hi> as if you would ſay <hi>Zoen Pheron</hi> bringing Life.</p>
                  <p>The Weſt-South-Weſt, is Cold, Moiſt, Rainy tempeſtuous. Hence <hi>Virgil</hi> calls it <hi>Creber Procellis,</hi> in the firſt of his <hi>Aeneids,</hi> ful of Storms. The Weſt-Nor-Weſt, is Stormy, Snowy, Hailing, Cold. Therefore <hi>it,</hi> and the North-wind, are the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt winds of all.</p>
                  <p>The South-wind is moiſt, Hot, Thundering, Peſtilent, engendring Clouds and Store of Rain, making the Air thick and Cloudy.</p>
                  <p>The South-South-Weſt is a temperate wind, Hot, Rainy, and ſomtimes Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering.</p>
                  <p>The South-South-Eaſt wind is Hot and Moiſt.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore the South-wind, the South-weſt wind, Weſt-South-weſt winds are hot, but of theſe the South-wind is Hotteſt, Hurrful and Peſtilent.</p>
                  <p>The South-South weſt is more moiſt then Hot. Howbeit, conſideration muſt be had of the Climate and the place.</p>
                  <p>The North-Nor-Eaſt wind is Cold and Dry, the Author of Cold, cutting the Clouds, ſtraitning our Bodies and ſhutting their Pores: making the Humors more pure, and Purging the peſtilential Air.</p>
                  <p>The North-Nor-weſt is the Author of Snow and Hail.</p>
                  <p>The North-wind is Cold and dry, without Rain, hurting Flowers, Fruits and budding Vines. And therefore the North-Nor-Eaſt, North and North-Nor-weſt winds do Purge the Air; and if they be not vehement cold, they make it clear and fair weather; but eſpecially the North-Nor-Eaſt and the North winds; and the North-Nor-Eaſt brings Hail, and the North-wind brings Snow. And Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally all winds from the North and Weſt are drier then from the South and Eaſt.</p>
                  <p>Hence ſome winds are healthy, others unhealthy.
<note place="margin">Of winds ſome are healthy, others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthy.</note> But in general the Southern winds are of all other moſt unwholeſome. For they cauſe moiſture and putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and therefore when it blows, neither Cellars, nor Houſes, nor Libraries, nor Granaries ſhould be ſet open. The South-wind is more violent in the Night, the North-wind in the Day: the South-wind on the Sea, and the North-wind on the Land.</p>
                  <p>A ſhort and moderate South-wind makes the Air clear; but a great and laſting South-wind Clouds the Air, and is wont to be more furious at the End then at the beginning: and therefore it brings more Rain at the Concluſion, then at firſt: but the North-Nor-Eaſt wind doth the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe winds which come through Populous places, as Cities ful of people, and where a great Army hath been long incamped, through Stinking and Venemous places, are hurtful: but thoſe which come through healthy places, as pleaſant Meddows, woods, and along running waters, are wholſome, for they are Seaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the Steams of Flowers, Leaves and Herbs. More obſervations concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the force of winds are to be read every where in the writings of Phyſitians, and in <hi>Pliny</hi> in the place fore alledged; alſo ſome things may be brought out of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> touching this ſubject, <hi>Probl.

We, deſirous to obſerve Brevity, omitting the examination of other Opinions, ſhall only lay open the Truth.</p>
                  <p>Seeing the Earth is of it ſelf immoveable, nor can be moved by any thing which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally goes about the ſame, as winds or waters, (againſt the Motions and moſt Vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Tempeſts whereof the Earth hath formerly ſtood and doth ſtill ſtand immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able:) 'tis to be thought, that it is moved in Earth-quakes from ſomwhat within it ſelf. Now in the Caverns of the Earth are included Waters and two kinds of Exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Now although that <hi>Gellius</hi> tels us, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 8.
<note place="margin">Waters are not the Cauſe of Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes.</note> that the moſt Ancient Greeks were of Opinion, that the Earth was moved by the Floods and Violent Motions of Waters abounding in the Caverns of the Earth; (and therefore they call <hi>Neptune</hi> the Earth-ſhaker:) yet waters being not very apt to move, nor diſpoſed to moſt ſwift and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent Motions cannot be accounted the Cauſe of Earth-quakes. Which is alſo confirmed by what <hi>Scaliger</hi> relates in his 38 <hi>Exercitation.</hi> There is ſaies he in the Weſterne part of the Iſland of <hi>Hiſpaniola</hi> a Mountain of huge Height, which hath many hollow Caves within it, whereinto Rivers are tumbled down with ſo great a noiſe and roaring of the waters that they are heard five Miles of, yet no Earth-quake is cauſed thereby. And the like Judgment we are to make of moiſt Vapors.</p>
                  <p>The Cauſe therefore of an Earth-quake muſt needs be hot and drie Exhalations.
<note place="margin">The true Cauſe.</note> For hot and dry Spirits are fitting to raiſe Motions moſt ſwift, Violent and Vehement, which is alſo apparent from Thunder, Thunder-bolts, Winds, Whirle-winds, Storms, and Guns: and every hot thing doth of its own Nature tend upwards. Alſo there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tokens hereof. For Hiſtories bear witneſs, that for the moſt part, after an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes a great abundance of winds and ſpirits have broken forth, and have caſt Stones, Aſhes, and other Obvious things out of the Caverns of the Earth; yea and the moſt Earth-quakes have not ceaſed till thoſe winds included have made an Eruption: which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> tels us did happen about <hi>Heraclea</hi> of <hi>Pontus,</hi> and the Iſland <hi>Hiera, in the</hi> 2 <hi>of his Meteors, Chap.</hi> 8. Moreover, moſt Earth-quakes happen, when the Sea is Calme and the Air free from winds; <hi>viz.</hi> When all the matter of Winds is contained in the Caverns of the Earth. You may finde more ſigns in <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in the Place foreal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged.</p>
                  <p>Now ſome hold, that theſe Spirits are either bred in the Caverns of the Earth by the Heat of the Sun and of the underground Fire; or that being bred without, they enter in; or that they are driven thither by the <hi>Antiperiſtaſis</hi> of the cold Air; or that when two contrary Winds do blow at once, the one being vanquiſhed by the other doth paſs into the Caverns of the Earth which it meets with; or to avoid Vacuity, when the waters go out, the Exhalations inſinuate themſelves into the hollow parts of the Earth. But the firſt amongſt theſe Cauſes is either the chief or only Cauſe. Now the Spirits which ſhake the Earth are contained in the profound Caverns thereof. For thoſe which are in the Cavities next the Surface of the Earth, ſeeing they can eaſily find an Egreſs, do not move the Earth. Now theſe Blaſts are moved, becauſe they have no place in the Caverns of the Earth fit and large enough, or becauſe they are preſſed by the Waters which flow to and from the Sea; or becauſe they are ſhut up by the <hi>Antiperiſtaſis</hi> of cold, and gathering force, and their heat being Augmented, they are Attenuated and Rarified; which alſo may be performed by the <hi>Subterranean</hi> or Under-ground Fires.</p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:35070:68"/>
                  <p> From the Premiſes therefore it appears, that an Earth-quake is cauſed, when hot and drie ſpirits are Praeternaturally ſhut up in the Caverns of the Earth, and ſeek their way out. For, not finding the ſame they move this way and that way, and by their great force and violence they ſhake the Earth. Now the ſundry manners and various fathions of Earth-quakes proceed from the greater or leſs Quantity of Exhalations; from the divers figures of the Caverns; from the longneſs or ſhortneſs of their diſtance from the Earth;
<note place="margin">Two man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Earth.</note> from the ſundry manners of the Exhalations breaking forth; which the Author of the Book <hi>de Mundo Cap.</hi> 4. and others do reckon up. Yet all of them may be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to two, whereof one may be called <hi>Tremor</hi> a trembling; which is cauſed, when much Spirit is ſpread out Long-waies and Broad-waies: the other <hi>Pulſus</hi> a beating or thruſting, when the Exhalation is diſpoſed rather long-waies. For it ſeeking Egreſs lifts up the Earth much after the ſame manner as the Arterie is lift up in the Diaſtole or widening of the pulſe.</p>
                  <p>From what hath been hitherto ſaid, it appears, that the whole Earth cannot be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at once. For the Spirits ſhut up in the Caverns of the Earth have no proportion (to ſpeak of) to the whole Globe thereof, nor have ſo much ſtrength in them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<note place="margin">
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes are not natural.</note> if there be any univerſall motions of the Earth, they ought to be referred rather to the inſinite power of God, then to Natural Cauſes. With the Earth-quake is ioyned a noiſe, cauſed by the vehement Motion of the Spirits running to and fro in the Caverns of the Earth, and ſmiting againſt the ſides of the Earth; which noiſe ſomtimes goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Earth-quake, and is a ſign thereof ſuddenly to follow; ſomtimes it accompanies the ſame, and it is various, according to the Quality of the matter receiving, and the form of the <hi>Cavities,</hi> or paſſages through which it goes.</p>
                  <p>The duration of an Earth-quake is not one and the ſame alwaies,
<note place="margin">How long the Earth-quake laſts.</note> but divers, according as the Earth doth more or leſs reſiſt, or gives an eaſie or diſſicult paſſage to the winds; or as the Spirits themſelves are plentiful or ſcanty. For ſew Spirits are ſooner diſcuſſed and ſooner get away, but ſtore of Spirits abide longer; alſo when there is a wide paſſage for them to go out, they go out apace; but when the paſſage is ſhut up or is very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, they get out more ſlowly and continue their Buſtling longer. So <hi>Seneca</hi> in <hi>Nat. Queſt. Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Cap.</hi> 30. Relates that <hi>Campania trembled continually for divers daies together.</hi> And <hi>Livy</hi> in <hi>Decad.</hi> 4. <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. Writes thus: In the beginning of the year, when <hi>L. Cornelius,</hi> and <hi>Q. Minutius</hi> were Conſuls, there were ſo many reports of Earth-quakes, that Men were weary not only of the thing it ſelf, but of the many Solemn daies appointed becauſe of the ſaid Earth-quakes. And the ſame Author in his 4 <hi>Decad. Lib.</hi> 5. tels us, there was an Earth-quake for forty daies together; yea and <hi>Ariſtotle in Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Meteor: Cap.</hi> 8. and <hi>Pliny</hi> in the 2. <hi>of Nat. Hiſt. Chap.</hi> 8. tels us that Earth-quakes have ſomtimes laſted a year or two years together, and that they have returned at certain Times and Seaſons.</p>
                  <p>The Effects truly of Earth-quakes are wonderfull and horrible.
<note place="margin">The won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſul ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Earth-Quakes.</note> For many times, (as <hi>Seneca in Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Nat. Quaeſt. Cap.</hi> 1. Speaks,) <hi>it doth not only ſwallow up ſingle Houſes, Families or Cities, but it overthrows whole Nations and Regions, and ſomtimes overwhelms them with Ruins, other-whiles covers them in a deep Gulf, not ſo much as leaving any appearance of them: ſo that the Earth is ſpread over moſt Noble Cities, not leaving any marke of their former Exiſtence:</hi> which happens when by impulſe of the Spirit the Caverns of the Earth are ſhaken and fall in. And ſomtimes indeed, the Cities and Houſes are not ſwallowed up in the <hi>Cavities</hi> of the Earth, but the Earth raiſed up in a tumor, they fal down flat. Hiſtories are full of ſuch calamitous accidents. In the Reign of <hi>Tiberius Caeſar</hi> 12.

                  </p>
                  <p>Many times alſo in the Sea a Gulf hath been opened, and the waters ſwallowed up, as Rivers on the Land, ſo that the Fiſhes and Ships have ſtood on dry ground. Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rywiſe, many times the Earth ſwelling on high hath not ſetled again, producing Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains on the maine Land, and Iſlands in the Sea: whereupon alſo ſomtimes the Sea hath
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:35070:68"/>been raiſed aloft like a Mountaine, and hath afterwards fell in upon the Neighbouring Lands. Such an Earth-quake <hi>Socrates</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>in the</hi> 2. <hi>Book of his Ecclefiaſtical Hiſtory, Chap.</hi> 3. For the ſame Cauſe the Courſes of Rivers have been ſomtimes chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by Earth-quakes, <hi>viz.</hi> a Tumor or ſwelling of ground being raiſed up in the middeſt of the former Channel. Somtimes new Rivers have broken forth, the ways being opened through which the underground Waters are carryed. Somtimes Fire and Aſhes are caſt out by an Earth-quake: ſomtimes a Venemous Spirit is belched forth, which proves baneful to Man and Beaſt. <hi>Seneca</hi> tells in <hi>B.</hi> 6. <hi>Nat. Queſt. ch.</hi> 27. of a Flock containing Six hundred Sheep, all kil'd by an Earth quake. Many other miſchiefs alſo an Earth-quake brings with it, all which were contained in that one Earth-quake which happened under <hi>Theedoſius,</hi> which is deſcribed by <hi>Euagrius</hi> in the 1 <hi>B. of his Eccleſiaſtick Hiſt. Chap.</hi> 17.</p>
                  <p>And we may wel believe, that Earth-quakes bring not only preſent miſchiefs, and that the danger is not alwaies in the motion, but that there is as great or greater foretold by Earth-quakes; and <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaies wel, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Nat.

And very many Hiſtories Teſtifie, that the ſame hath happened in other places.</p>
                  <p>And therefore look what the Romans did of old, who when they felt an Earth-quake, or heard tidings thereof, they made Proclamation that the people ſhould keep Solemn daies for that Cauſe, as <hi>Gellius</hi> tells us, <hi>B.</hi> 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 28. much more ſhould we, when ſuch Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities are preſent or impendent, cal upon God by Prayer.

In the middlemoſt Region are ingendred Clouds, Raine, Snow and Hail.</p>
                  <p>A Cloud is engendred when vapors being raiſed aloft, either by heat which they have received from the Sun, or other heating cauſes, or by hot Exhalations mixt with them,
<note place="margin">How a Cloud is ingendred.</note> are aſſembled in the middle Region of the Air, ſo that they cannot be penetrated by the ſight. For a Cloud is nothing elſe but a vapor raiſed up in the middle Region of the Air,
<note place="margin">What a Cloud is.</note> and there compacted; which appears hereby, in that in the lower Region of the Air, when vapors and Exhalations are raiſed out of things which boil or burn, they repreſent Clouds; and becauſe they that walking beneath ſee Clouds upon Mountains, when they aſcend to the tops of the ſaid Mountains, they walk through the Clouds as through Miſts; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as ſoon as the ſaid Exhalations are condenſed they remain no longer Clouds, but turn into Rain.</p>
                  <p>Touching the Height of Clouds, Authors are at variance.
<note place="margin">The height of the Clouds.</note> Some conceive that the Clouds are not above three miles diſtant from us; yea and that ſome of them are not above half a mile high. Others write that no Cloud is above nine miles diſtant from the Earth. <hi>Vitellio</hi> is of opinion, that the vapors aſcend 52000, paces, or 13. German miles. <hi>Cardan</hi> in his <hi>book de Subtil. Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 205. reprehends <hi>Vitellio,</hi> and avers that the higheſt which vapors mount is 772000 paces, or 193. German miles. Howbeit, 'tis like enough, that the height of the Clouds is not alwaies the ſame, but various, according to the variety of the matter, places and times: Yea, and we often ſee with our Eyes, that at the ſame time and in the ſame Region, one Cloud is higher then another, and that one goes above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I my ſelf have ſeen two clouds carried with contrary motions: and one moving above the other, towards the Eaſt; the other moved under the other, toward the Weſt. Alſo experience ſhews that clouds are not ſo high, as ſome imagin. For the tops of ſome Mountains reach above the clouds. For the Mountains <hi>Olympus</hi> and <hi>Athos</hi> are ſo high that Aſhes left upon their tops all the year long have neither been blown away by Winds, nor waſhed away with Rain. And ſuch as have ſtood on the top of <hi>Veſuvius</hi> have obſerved that ſome clouds were juſt as high as the Mountaine, and ſome
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:35070:69"/>much lower. To which that agrees which <hi>Zabarella</hi> writes in his 8. <hi>Chap. de Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anth. Aeris. I went</hi> ſaith he, to the top of <hi>Venus Mount,</hi> which is the higheſt in the Territory of <hi>Padua,</hi> and there I found the Air clear all day long; but beneath, a bout the middle of the Mountain, I ſaw the Clouds, which hindred me from ſeeing the Valleys: and in the Evening being come down from the ſaid Mountain, I found that there had been a great Rain that day, below, whereas it Rained not at all on the Mountains top. <hi>Franciſc. Piccolhomineus</hi> de Meteor. C. 11. ſaies the ſame, how that Men living upon high Mountains, or Travailing thereupon, do ſee the Rains below them in the Valleys; whereas they themſelves are in clear weather; and he ſaies the ſame happened to himſelf travelling over the Alpes and the Apen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine Hills.

<note place="margin">What Rain is and how 'tis bred?</note> are fit to engender Rain. For Rain is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a Cloud, Cooled, Condenſed, and turned to Water. And Rain is bred, when the va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ors which make a Cloud are yet more condenſed, and turned into Water; which being heavier then the Air fals down of its own accord in drops. For Rain is made after the ſame manner as hot vapors upon the walls of Baths, or in the Winter in hot ſtoves upon Globes of Glaſs, Iron or Tin jugs that are cold, are turned as we ſee into Watry drops.</p>
                  <p>Now there is ſome diverſity of Rains,
<note place="margin">Diverſity of Rains.</note> proceeding from the variety of the Clouds, and of their place, which is ſomtimes higher and ſomtimes lower. For when the Cloud is High, Unequal, Spungy and Barren, and few ſmal drops fal like Dew, they are called <hi>Pſecades</hi> heat-drops.
<note place="margin">Pſecades. Imber.</note> But if the Cloud be more near and compact, and the drops fal down thicker, 'tis called <hi>Imber</hi> a ſhower. Finally, if the Cloud be yet thicker and ſuddenly condenſed by a greater cold, and greater drops fall more thickly,
<note place="margin">Nimbus.</note> 'tis called <hi>Nimbus</hi> a ſtrong ſhower. Yea and ſomtimes whole Clouds are ſo condenſed by a ſudden cold, that the waters deſcend not drop by drop, but come down in ſtreams,
<note place="margin">The Lump of a Cloud.</note> and deſtroy Towns and Cities: and then they ſay a Lump of a Cloud is fallen down.</p>
                  <p>Alſo there are <hi>Prodigious Showers</hi> ſo called, ſuch as we read of every where in Hiſtories,

Yea and ſome relate out of <hi>Avicenna</hi> that once on a time a Calf fel out of the Sky.</p>
                  <p>Moſt of theſe Prodigious Rains are to be aſcribed to Superior Cauſes,
<note place="margin">Their Cauſes.</note> 
                     <hi>viz.</hi> To God warning Men of Evils to come; and to the Devil, indeavoring by ſuch Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies to draw men into Errors and Superſtitions; yet ſome of them may alſo be
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:35070:69"/>referred to Natural Cauſes. True Bood and Milk cannot Naturally deſcend in ſhowers; ſince they are bred only in living Creatures. Yet nothing hinders but ſomwhat like them may fall down, <hi>viz.</hi> When by the Sun-beams a vapor is drawn out of a red or white Earth, or is a loft ſo digeſted, that it may ſhew ſuch a color, and being afterwards reſolved into Rain may reſemble Milk or Blood. And that ſmal Stones may be made by a great heat of ſtore of dry Exhalations in the Air, is a matter ſounding like Truth.</p>
                  <p>As for thoſe kind of living Creatures which may otherwiſe be bred of Putrefaction, ſuch as Frogs, were muſt hold, that either they are ingendred of ſome matter in the Earth moiſtened with ſhowers (which ſeems to many men moſt probable) or that they lie hid in the chinks and Caverns of the Earth, and by the falling of the Rain are called out as it were and ſo leap forth. But incredible it is that more perfect Animals which are generated only of Seed, and great Stones ſhould be bred in the Air: but likely it is they have been caught up by whirlwinds in one place, and thrown down in another. Now there are certain ſigns of Rain as of other Tempeſts, which would be too long to reckon up in this place, and long Catalogues of the ſame are ſet down by others.

<note place="margin">How ſnow is bred?</note> For Snow is bred of a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por raiſed to the middle Region of the Air or ſomwhat lower, or of a thin cloud before it is turned into Water and Rain, congealed by vehement Cold, and torne into parts or flakes, which deſcend like ſoft Wooll, ſomtimes greater, other whiles leſſer, according to the vehemency of the Cold. Now Snow is bred in the Winter time chiefly, becauſe the cold is then ſtrong and vehement, ſo that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>Now Snow is white, becauſe 'tis ingendred of a Spungy tranſparent cloud.
<note place="margin">The color of Snow why white.</note> And that which is tranſparent, after it is terminated, doth next of all become white, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that color is moſt of kin to tranſparency.

And therefore frequently when it Rains in Valleys, it Snows upon the high Mountains. And for the ſame cauſe on the higheſt Mountains, when there is no Snow to be ſeen on the Plain ground, there hath been Snow lying, even in the middle of the Summer. Touching the good which Snow doth to fruits and Trees, read <hi>Pliny</hi> his 2. <hi>chap. of the</hi> 17. <hi>Book of his Natural Hiſtory.</hi>

Now Hail is congealed, not only in the middlemoſt, but alſo in the loweſt Region of the Air. Which may hence be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered becauſe ſomtimes Chaf is found congealed in Hail ſtones, which Chaf as it was coming down the cold alſo intercepted, and ſhut up in the congealed Water. If the cold be remiſs a certain imperfect and ſoft kind of Hail is bred, of a middle Nature betwixt true Hail and Snow, which they term <hi>Granula,</hi> and reſembles ſmal Sugar-Plums, and this fals chiefly about the End of Winter. Before the falling of Hail, for the moſt part great and terrible ſounds are heard in the Air, which are cauſed by the great contreſt of Heat and Cold in the Clouds. Hairs, and Chaf, and other things which are ſomtimes encloſed in Hail-ſtones, have been carried a loft by the Winds, and congealed together by the Cold.

<note place="margin">The Dew where and how ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</note> which becauſe of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the heat reaches no further then the loweſt Region of the Air, and indeed below the upper part thereof, and being by the cold of a temperate night turned into ſmal drops of Water, it ſticks to Plants and other things. For the dew is chiefly found on the Leaves and Flowers of Plauts, eſpecially where they are ſmooth and thick; and ſomtimes alſo in other parts of them, as alſo upon Stones. For though it fals a like upon all places below; yet either by reaſon of their frequent pores, and roughneſs, or by their heat, it is drunk up and diſſipated. On high Mountains there is no Dew bred; and ſomtimes alſo it riſes not above two cubits, and only the graſs is moiſtned thereby, but things a little higher remain dry. Dew therefore differs from Rain, only in the paucity of the matter, the place where it is bred, and the weaker heat whereby it is congealed. Now Dew is Generated chiefly in the Spring and Fall: but in the Heat of Summer and Cold of Winter it is not bred. For the Heat conſumes the matter; and the cold ſuffers not the Vapors to be raiſed. Alſo it is not Generated, but when the Sky is calme and clear; becauſe when the Sky is troubled and agitated with winds the vapor is diſpelled, and cannot be congea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into Dew. Likewiſe Dew never fals but in the morning and Evening. For in the day time it is conſumed by the Suns heat, and degenerates into a very thin and light Spirit, ſo that if an Eg-ſhell be filled with Dew, and the hole ſtopped with Wax, or other Glew,

The Chymiſts teach, that Dew contains in it the moſt ſubtile part of Nitre and Volatile Salt, which is contained in the ſurface of the Earth, and therefore it is uſed to make Extracts.</p>
                  <p>Hore Froſt doth not very much differ from Dew; for Hore Froſt is bred, when a thin Vapor in a ſmal Quantity is lift up from the Earth, and cannot riſe high, but by the vehement cold of the night it is congealed, before it turns to water. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, look what Snow is in the middle Region of the Aire, that is Hore Froſt in the loweſt Region; and what is Rain above, is Dew below.</p>
                  <p>Alſo Honey is to reckoned as a kind of Dew,

                        </gap>ow it is bred?</note> touching the generation whereof this is the common Opinion: that with the Vapors which are drawn up in the day time out of Waters and Moiſt places, for the moſt part, Hot, Fat, and ſubtile Exhalations are lifted up, not only out of the Earth and Water, but alſo out of Plants and other things, which being throughly mixed with Earthy Watery and aery parts, and concocted by the heat of the Sun in the day time, and then by the moderate cold of the Night condenſed, they ſtick upon Plants like Dew. And
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:35070:70"/>that Honey is nothing elſe but a juyce, conſiſting of Exhalations and vapors, ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and digeſted in the Air, by the Heat of the day, and congealed by the nights Cold, and ſo deſcending in the manner of Dew.</p>
                  <p>Which opinion as it is not quite to be rejected: ſo it ſeems not ſatisfactory of it ſelf. For if the Dew be eaſily elſewhere diſſipated and diſcuſſed by the morning beams of the Sun: How comes it that Manna and Honey are not alſo diſlipated. Alſo manna and Honey differ not a little from Dew; nor hath Dew of it ſelf any Fat or Clammy parts. And therefore this alſo ſeems ſit to be added: that out of Plants a certain juyce and Native Vapor doth diſtil or breath our, which neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs is diſſipated by the day-heat of the Sun: but it is at night mingled with the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Dew, which hinders it from being diſſipated, and grows with it into one Nature. From whence 'tis caſie to ſhew a Cauſe, why there is more Honey gathered at this or that time of year, in this or that conſtitution of the Air.</p>
                  <p>And therefore though all Honey is ſweet of it ſelf; yet ſomtimes both its Taſt and Smel is changed, according to the Nature of the Plant from which it is gathered: and therefore it is ſomtimes Venemous, when it is gathered from venemous Plants. Whereof ſee <hi>Pliny Lib.</hi> 21. <hi>Nat. Hiſt. Cap.</hi> 13. <hi>Dioſcorid. B.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 74. <hi>and Book</hi> 6. <hi>Cap.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>This ſame Honey is twofold, Manna called alſo Air-Honey, or Dew-Honey,
<note place="margin">Two ſorts of honey.</note> and which in a ſpecial manner is called Honey. For Manna is a Honey or Dewy Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, mixt of a vapor and the Subtile and Fat Exhalations of Plants. and by the temperate coldneſs of a clear night congealed; ſticking upon Plants, Stones and other things near the Ground; which at firſt is more liquid, and after ward the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner parts reſolved it becomes harder, and having attained its conſiſtency, it is coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated into certain grains. For although ſome hold, and among them <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus a Vega Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Art. Med. Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. That Manna is the work of certain ſmal bees reſembling large Gnats, from which Bees ſitting in ſwarms upon the Trees the Manna drops down like ſweat: yet moſt likely it is, that theſe ſmal Creatures are rather drawn thither by the ſweetneſs of the Manna, then that they make the ſame. There is much bred in the Eaſt, becauſe of the purity of the Air and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain moderation of heat and cold in thoſe parts. 'Tis not bred in cold places: there is little bred in <hi>Italy,</hi> ſave in <hi>Calabria,</hi> from whence it is carried as a commodity into other parts.</p>
                  <p>Now whether that Manna wherewith the Iſraelites were fed fourty years in the Wilderneſs, was the ſame with this of ours, Authors vary. <hi>Valleſius</hi> in his <hi>B.
<note place="margin">Whether our manna be the ſame which the Iſraelites had.</note> de Sacra Philoſoph. chap.</hi> 57. and other later writers hold it was the ſame kind of thing. Many things ſaid of that Manna of the <hi>Hebrews, Exod.</hi> 16. <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. do alſo agree to this of ours: yet herein <hi>that</hi> diſagrees from ours, becauſe thereof, (beaten or ground.) Cakes or Cracknels were made. For our Manna is not of ſuch an hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But however herein all agree, that many things which hapned touching the <hi>Hebrews</hi> Manna cannot be attributed to Natural Cauſes, but only to the infinite power of the moſt good and great God.</p>
                  <p>But vulgar Honey differs little from Manna,
<note place="margin">Common honey what it is, how differing from man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, &amp; how generated.</note> and the matter of both is one and the ſame, ſave that the matter of Manna is thicker, more compact and Earthy; but that of Honey more ſubtile and more digeſted. For Honey is a certain Dew, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by Bees, and receiving alteration from the little bladders they have within them, and afterwards ſtored up by them in little cells in manner of a pure Liquor, wherein afterwards it works like new Wine; and is by its Natural heat concocted, and grows thick, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> relates in his 5. <hi>de Hiſtor. Animal. Cap.</hi> 22. and <hi>Pliny</hi> in <hi>Nat. Hiſt. L.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 13.</p>
                  <p>Honey is chiefly gathered by Bees both wild and domeſtick: Yea and Drones alſo and other inſects, being much of the Nature of Bees, do gather Honey, out of all Herbs which have hollow flowers like Cups, and out of others wherein there is any ſweetneſs: which is done without any detriment to the ſlowers.

                  </head>
                  <p>AFter Clouds and ſuch things as are of them ingendred, there remain to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led certain things appearing in them, called <hi>Phantaſmata,</hi> apparitions; ſuch as are the Rain-bow, the Halo or bright Circle, and other like Images. And to begin with the <hi>Iris</hi> or Rain-bow, which they ſay hath its Name <hi>ab Eirein</hi> to tel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it foretels Rain or Fair weather, (and therefore it is by Poets termed <hi>Junos</hi> Meſſenger,
<note place="margin">What the Rain-bow is?</note>) It is a bow of three colors, in a Dewy cloud, cauſed by the beams of the Sun or Moon oppoſite to the ſaid Cloud, and therein refract and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexed.</p>
                  <p>And that it may be better underſtood what the Nature of a Rain-bow is, all the members of the definition muſt be weighed. The ſubject of a Rain-bow is a dewy vapor, or a Dewy Cloud, which is beginning to be reſolved into drops or Rain; but it is not yet Rain, only it is condenſed into little drops like dew or the Water which a man blows abroad out of his mouth half ſhut. For a continued Cloud is not the ſubject of a Rain-bow; but thoſe parts thereof which do no longer hang to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, but being by the cold ſtraitened and condenſed are every where diſtant one from another, divided into very many ſmal drops, which are like little Looking-Glaſſes, and are of a middle Nature betwixt a perfect Rain and a Cloud.</p>
                  <p>Now that the Rain-bow cannot be made in any continued vapor,
<note place="margin">The ſubject of the Rain how.</note> but that it may be generated in many little round Bodies, is demonſtrated from the rules of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks concerning the Nature of reflection. We ſhall only here produce what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teaches. Let a man ſtand with the hind part of his Head to the Sun, and with his mouth or other Inſtrument let him throw water into the beams of the Sun, ſo that the Water may loſe its continuity, and be reſolved into very many very ſmal drops: which being performed, a Rain-bow as it were will appear in thoſe little drops, which repreſent the rorid Vapor. The ſame may be obſerved when the Water is ſcattered by Oares, or falling violently upon a ſtone it is ſcattered into the Sun-beams. And though the rorid Cloud, which is the ſubject of a Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, is no longer continued; yet to us it appears continued, by Reaſon of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinity of the parts, and its overgreat diſtance from us.</p>
                  <p>The efficient Cauſe of a Rain-bow,
<note place="margin">The effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe of a Rain bow</note> are the beams of the Sun and Moon, broken and reflected in theſe drops. And that reflexion is altogether neceſſary to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of a Rain-bow, hence appears; becauſe both the incident Raies and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fract do go into the part oppoſite to the lightſome Body, nor do they paſs on to the part ſeen by the lightſome Body; nor to the ſight, which is averſe from the lightſome Body in-ſuch as behold the Rain-bow, can they come, unleſs they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected. Therefore in the ſame manner, as we ſee in looking-Glaſſes the Images of things behind us, even ſo the raies of the Sun or Moon are reflected in thoſe little loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king-Glaſſes.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit, 'Tis neceſſary that there be alſo refraction. For when as a Ray of the Sun or Moon comes to the firſt drop of the Vapor, it pierces the ſame being through nearneſs of the Sun not yet much condenſed, yet ſo as that it is refracted. From thence going to another hindermore drop, which is thick enough, it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently reflected, if no other drop of a rorid vapor ſtand before the ſame: but if any ſuch drop ſtand in the way, the beam is firſt refracted, and afterwards ſo refracted it is reflected to our ſight. Alſo many Raies are refracted in many obvious drops; and whiles they fall in, and pierce through divers thinner drops to one thicker, in which they are reflected; then by ſuch a like drop they are again reflected. For every Ray, as wel the incident as the reflect, is twice refract in ſuch a drop. Firſt, Towards a perpendicular line, when it enters the drop; becauſe it fals out of the thinner Air into a thicker Rorid Vapor: afterward, 'tis diſjoyned from the perpendicular, when it goes again out of a thick drop into the thin Air.</p>
                  <p>The Rain-bow therefore is bred, when ſome rorid Cloud is in making, and begins to be reſolved into very many ſmal drops, and to be condenſed into Water:
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:35070:71"/>Which drops are yet nevertheleſs more thin, and not quite turned into Water, ſo as to fall down. For if the Sun or Moone ſhine juſt oppoſite thereupon, the lucid beams being variouſly refracted in theſe drops, and reflected to our fight in form of a Pyramid, their light being confuſed and mixt with the Heat and ſhadow of the drops, they preſent unto our ſight a coloured Bow.</p>
                  <p>Now moſt Rain-bows are cauſed by the Sun, few by the Moon.
<note place="margin">A Sun &amp; a Moon Rain bow.</note> And therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> tells us, that in the ſpace of fifty years there were but two Moone Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bows ſeen. For to the making of a Moon Rain-bow, beſides a fitting vapour, 'tis requiſite that the Moon be in the full; otherwiſe its beams are too weak; alſo that it be near the Horizon: al which do ſeldom ſall out. In the Year 1599 foregoing, at Mid Summer, after great Thunder, Lightning, Thunder-Bolts and Rain in the Night, betwixt the North and Eaſt we ſaw a remarkable Rain-bow, which might compate with ſome Sun-Rain-bows, in the Brightneſs and Beauty of its Colours. Now why only the Sun and Moon make Rain-Bows, the Reaſon is,
<note place="margin">Why the Rain bow is made only by the Sun and Moon.</note> becauſe the beams of theſe Stars only can reach Croſs the Horizon to the Clouds, and be from thence reflected; thoſe of the Sun becauſe they are moſt ſtrong; thoſe of the Moon becauſe they are near at hand. But the Beams of the other Stars are either too weak or too far off. Or if they be ſo ſtrong as to be able to reach croſs the Diameter of the world to the Clouds: yet are they not ſo ſtrong as to be reflected to our ſight. For reflect Lights are weaker then thoſe that ſhoot their Beams directly, according to the Rules of Opticks.</p>
                  <p>Now why only the Colours and not the Image of the Sun or Moon appears in theſe Looking-glaſſes, there is a Threefold Cauſe. Firſt,
<note place="margin">Why only colors and not the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age it ſelf of the Sun and Moon appear.</note> becauſe the Cloud is not a continued Body, but reſolved into very little drops or Optick Glaſſes. For in ſo ſmal Glaſſes the Images alſo are very ſmall, which being afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected are ſo weak, as that they appear not diſtinct, but confuſed. Againe, the Raies are of themſelves weakned before they come from the Luminous Body to the ſight. Finally add hereto the blackneſs of the Cloud. For the rorid va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, becauſe it begins to be reſolved into water, aſſumes a certain blackneſs and Watry Colour, which being mingled with the Light, makes that the Image of the Sun or Moon cannot diſtinctly appear, but rather a Colour.</p>
                  <p>Now the diverſity of Colours in the Rain-bow ſprings from hence,
<note place="margin">The Colors of the Rain bow.</note> becauſe ſome raies enter more deeply into the dewy Vapour, and are reflected by the remoter droplets, others are reflected from meaner vapours and reſting in the ſurface of the Cloud, by which are made divers reflexive pyramides, having baſes equally diſtant. Now the Colours are three, red which is the upmoſt, or outmoſt, and is bred of the greater ſplendor, and the raies of that reflexive pyramid, whoſe baſis is of all others neareſt our ſight: and therefore its Raies are alſo ſtrongeſt. Now becauſe the Light is bright ſhining, and the Water blackiſh, the Colour appears neither white nor black, but a reddiſh Colour betwixt both. The next Colour is a Leek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>green; which is the middlemoſt in the Rain bow, this is cauſed by the Raies reflected from a more deep part of the vapour; and therefore it inclines more to blackneſs. For the Raies alſo themſelves are weaker, becauſe reflected from a place more remote; and that vapour becauſe it is farther from the Sun, is more compact, and comes nearer to the Nature of Water then the former. Hitherto alſo the ſhadows do very much contribute, which are ſhed from the former droplets or ſmal glaſſes upon the hindermore, with which the raies reflected from the hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more are mingled. Of which we have an example in the colours that are in the necks of Doves, ariſing from the Sun-beams. For theſe colours are bred from the ſhadows that being ſent from the Feathers are mingled with the Suns light. The third is the Purple, which is the internal, and ariſes from the Raies reflected from a place yet more remote; and for the ſame reaſons why the Second is blacker then the Firſt, the Third is blacker then the Second.</p>
                  <p>And although there may be more then theſe three Colours in a Rain-bow; yet becauſe for the ſaid Reaſons the Blackneſs is more and more increaſed, after the third no Colour can be perceived: and not only the reflected Raies are ſo weak that they cannot reach to our ſight; but the Light alſo is ſo darkned by the Blackneſs of many ſhadows, that it is hardly diſcernable by the ſight. Now the fourth Colour which they call yellow, and is ſeen betwixt the firſt and ſecond, is no new Colour, but ariſes from the Neighbourhood of thoſe two. Now the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:35070:72"/>Lunary Rain-bow is whiter then the Solar:
<note place="margin">The Moon Rain bow whiter then that of the Sun.</note> becauſe the Light it ſelf of the Moon is paler then that of the Sun; again, becauſe the ſhadows which are by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more drops caſt upon the hindermore are not ſo obſcure and dark, as thoſe caſt by the Light of the Sun. For the ſhadow of a ſtronger Light is blacker, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe. Add alſo hereto the darkneſs of the night. For that which is of its own Nature Blackiſh, if it be ſet by a more black thing, it appears whiter.</p>
                  <p>But why the Circumference only of a Circle appears and not the whole and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Body thereof, the cauſe is: foraſmuch as that part only of any irradiated Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is ſeen, from which the Raies are reflected to the ſame centre of ſight, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to equal Angles, and of a radiated cloud nothing is ſeen but what is carried by Raies collected in the ſame point of the Axis wherein the ſight is. But theſe do only make a bow, as the Teachers of Opticks do at large demonſtrate.</p>
                  <p>Now why the Rain-bow never makes a perfect Circle,
<note place="margin">Why the Rain bow never makes a perfect Circle.</note> but either a Semi-circle, or an Arch leſs then a Semi-circle; and that it is a Semi-circle when the Luminary is in the Horizon, but an Arch leſs then a Semi-circle, when the luminary is above the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon; &amp; that the Arch is ſo much the wider, by how much the Lummary is nearer the Horizon; and ſo much the leſſer by how much it is nearer the Meridian; the reaſon thereof is, becauſe the Centre of the lucid Body, of the ſight, and of the Rain-bow, are alwaies in one and the ſame right line. And therefore the Centre of the Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Body being placed in the Horizon, in the oppoſite part of the Horizon will be the Centre of the Rain-bow, and ſo there wil be a Semi-circle above the Horizon. But when the Sun is elevated above the Horizon; the Centre of the Rain-bow is on the other ſide depreſſed; and therefore that Segment of the Circle which is beneath the Horizon is greater becauſe it contains the Centre, and that above is leſs. For we ſee only thoſe things which are above the Horizon And by how much leſs of the Diameter of the Rain-bow is above the Horizon, ſo much the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the Circumference of the Circle; and a Semi circle is half of the leſſer Circle of any Arch whatever that is greater, which proceeds from the Refraction of the beams: becauſe about the Sun-riſe the Air and vapors are thicker, which afterwards by the directer beams of the Sun are attenuated. And therefore the Rain-bow which is ſeen through a thicker Medium, appears alſo larger. But I paſs over theſe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things which might be ſaid of Rain-bows, ſeeing they cannot be rightly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained without optical demonſtrations and many Diagrams, which muſt be here for brevities ſake omitted. They may be ſeen in <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> 3. <hi>de Meteor Ch.</hi> 4, 5. the writings of optical Authors, and in the learned Treatiſe of <hi>Johannes Fleiſcherus, de Iridibus,</hi> wherein he comprehends the Doctrine of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Vitellio</hi> concerning Rain-bows, and augments the ſame with neceſſary demonſtrations.</p>
                  <p>Of kin to Rain-bows are the falſe Suns,
<note place="margin">Falſ Suns.</note> or other Suns placed by the true Sun. Now the <hi>Parelios</hi> or falſe Sun, is the Image of the Sun, received in a Cloud conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, compact, equal, ready to turn to Water, in its forepart Tranſparent and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed as it were; in its hinder part dark and terminated, and placed obliquely by the Suns ſide, and reflected thence to our ſight. For look as if a man ſhould ſet a Looking-Glaſs ſlanting by the ſide of any thing, he will twice ſee the Image of the thing: ſo if a Smooth cloud like a Looking-Glaſs be ſet aſſant beſide the Sun, there will appear divers Suns. But <hi>Pliny</hi> writes that to his time there had never been ſeen more then three at once, <hi>Hiſt. Nat. B.</hi> 2. <hi>Ch.</hi> 31. Howbeit they report that ſix were ſeen at <hi>Papia,</hi> before the War. Now theſe falſe Suns ſeldom appear, becauſe there is ſeldom found a cloud that hath ſuch a diſpoſition and ſuch a Poſture to the Sun.</p>
                  <p>After the ſame manner is cauſed the Paraſelene or falſe Moon,
<note place="margin">The Parae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelene or ſatſ Moon.</note> which herein only differs from a Parelios, that the former is an Image of the Sun, this latter of the Moon. Now the Images of theſe two Stars only are reflected to us; becauſe their Raies are the ſtrongeſt. Yea and a falſe Moon never appears but when the Moon is in the ful, when her Light is moſt plentiful and ſtrong.</p>
                  <p>Hither alſo are to be referred the <hi>Virgae</hi> or Rods ſo called,
<note place="margin">Rods, and ſtrakes in the Sky.</note> which are as it were certain lines and long Pillars, which appear of divers colors, in an uneven cloud, placed on one ſide of the Sun, ariſing from the beams thereof refracted. For ſuch ſtraks are ingendred, when an uneven cloud, which hath ſome parts thicker and as it were of a wateriſh Nature, and others thinner, is placed beſide the Sun. For when the Sun-beams fall thereinto, they cannot pierce equally becauſe of the diverſity of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:35070:72"/>the parts; nor do they appear contiguous, but rather disjoyned, and in the hinder parts, through which they penetrate, refracted; and ſo they repreſent divers colors: after the ſame manner as the Sun-Beams coming through chinks into a cloſe Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, they repreſent lightſome Lines. Now the colors are not the ſame, but vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous according to the divers diſpoſition of the parts wherein the Raies are received, which in thinner parts appear more light and white, in thicker more black and dark. Now theſe Rods or Strakes do appear for the moſt part, when the Sun riſes or when he ſets, but never at Noon tide; for then his Beams are ſo ſtrong, that they eaſily attenuate and pierce into thickeſt Vapors.</p>
                  <p>Finally, There is ſeen in the Clouds the <hi>Halo,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hale the Circle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Sun, Moon &amp;c.</note> which is by the Author of the Book <hi>de Mundo</hi> thus deſined, <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Halo</hi> is a ſhining Circle, under the Sun, Moon, or other cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ar Star, appearing juſt betwixt us and the Star, made by the Beams thereof there refracted. For this ſame Circle is made when the ſtronger beams of ſome Star fal into a cloud equally ſpungy, which in regard of the Spungineſs can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed paſs through, yet are refracted therein becauſe of the thickneſs of the Air, and being refracted to even Angles they make a Crown. Now in the Center of the Crown the Star appears which is the cauſe thereof; becauſe the ſtraight Raies are ſtronger, and do more attenuate, Rariſie, and Illuminate the cloud. Now this kind of Crown appears moſt commonly a nights. But the vehement heat of the Sun diſſipates the Vapor, and makes it more rare, ſo as it is unfit to refract the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams, by which means ſuch a colored circle might ariſe. Now the Sky muſt be calm, that the <hi>Halo</hi> may be ſeen. For a cloud moved and variouſly agitated can neither retain an equal diſpoſition of parts, nor preſent a certain color by the refracted Raies.</p>

                  <head>Chap. 10. <hi>Of Fountains.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>BUt that we may at laſt finiſh our Doctrine of Meteors, let us ſpeak ſomwhat in the laſt place of Fountains and of the Sea.
<note place="margin">Ariſtotle his opinion of the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of Fountains.</note> The opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly known touching the original of Fountains: how that Air and Exhalations in the Caverns of the Earth do by the coldneſs of the place loſe their heat, grow thick, and are turned into water: after the ſame manner as in the middle Region of the Air, of vapors condenſed, Rain is ingendred; which afterwards deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and from many places gathered into one, and there flowing out become a Fountain: whoſe continual running is maintained by new Air daily ſucceeding in the Room of the former to avoid Vacuity, and afterwards changed into Water.</p>
                  <p>But in good deed if we underſtand this Opinion of his concerning all Rivers, it is not true. For though we ſhould grant that ſome Water may be made of Vapors condenſed in the Caverns of the Earth, and that this may haply give beginning to ſome Fountains: yet we cannot be brought to think, that ſo much Water is this way generated, as to ſupply all the Fountains and Rivers that run upon the Earth. For ſince it is apparent, how great a Quantity of Air is required to make a little Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and how much ſpace thoſe vapors take up of which a little Rain is bred; where will there be ſo many and ſo large Caverns, wherein ſo many Vapors, and ſo much Air, can be collected for the production of ſo many and ſo great Rivers? Alſo a reaſon of the perpetual Courſe of Rivers can hardly be rendred according to this opinion; ſeeing there is not alwaies the ſame plenty of Vapors. Much leſs can a Reaſon be given why many Fountains Iſſue from the tops of the higheſt Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore rather embrace that opinion which is the moſt ancient of all,
<note place="margin">The true opinion.</note> which the Preacher in <hi>Bccleſ.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 7. comprehends in theſe words: <hi>All Rivers run into the Sea, and the Sea Flowes not over; the Rivers return to the places from whence they came, that they may flow again;</hi> And let us hold with very many moſt learned men, that Fountains and Rivers as they run into the Sea, ſo have they their Original from thence. For otherwiſe the continual running of Rivers cannot be made forth, not a cauſe be given, why the Sea receiving perpetually ſo many Rivers runs not over: or how Fountains come to ariſe from the tops of higheſt Mountains. And
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:35070:73"/>unleſs the Rivers had their Original from the Sea,
<note place="margin">Why the Sea flows not over.</note> it could not be but the Sea muſt run over. For the Rivers have ſome proportion to the Bulk of the Sea, ſeeing ſome of them are poured with ſuch violence and in ſo great plenty into the Sea, that for the ſpace of many miles together they afford in the Continent ſweet Waters to the Mariners, amidſt the Sea Waters. Nor can the Sun or Winds conſume ſo much thereof as doth flow in; but the Sea repairs its detriment which it receives in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with the Rivers from the Sun and Wind, out of the Air, in the Nights. Alſo many Fountains have many things common with the Sea. <hi>Pliny</hi> writes in <hi>Nat. Hiſt. Book</hi> 2. <hi>Oh.</hi> 103. of Jupiters Fountain in <hi>Dodona,</hi> that it was alwaies dry at Noon; and from thence the Water encreaſed, till at Mid-night it overflowed, and after that it deceaſed by little and little. And he relates <hi>in the ſame place,</hi> How that overagainſt the River <hi>Timavus</hi> there was a ſmal Iſland in the Sea, with hot Fountains in it which Ebd and flowed as the Sea. Nor doth <hi>Plato</hi> ſeem to have been averſe to this Opinion, who in his Dialogue called <hi>Phaedo</hi> writes, that there is an hollow place in the Earth, into which all Rivers run, and out of which they run back again.</p>
                  <p>Hence alſo a cauſe may eaſily be rendred,
<note place="margin">Why Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ains ariſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>om the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ps of higheſt Hills?</note> why Fountains arife on the higheſt tops of Mountains. For ſince the Globe of the Earth is round, and the ſtore and weight of the Sea Water is great: it may eaſily by its weight thruſt the water which flows through the veins of the Earth into the higheſt Mountains. And whereas the Fountain waters are not Salt, though the Sea is Salt, and that they have great diverſity in qualities, ſprings from hence; becauſe the Sea Water being ſtrained through many turnings and Veins in the Earth, loſes its ſaltneſs, and receives other qualities out of the Caverns of the Earth through which it runs and flows. Now the difference of Fountains is great; for ſome are uſed inſtead of drink, and others for Phyſick. The former are more ſimple, the latter more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound.</p>
                  <p>Metal line or Mineral Waters are thoſe,
<note place="margin">Mineral waters what?</note> which have in them the ſpirits or ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt particles of Minerals, Metals, and Subterranean Juyces, and differ from other ordinary potable Waters, in Smel, Taſt, Color, and therefore are not uſed for drink,
<note place="margin">They are twofold.</note> but only as Phyſick. Now theſe Waters are of two kinds; ſome have in them the very Bodies of Minerals and Mineral Juyces, ſuch as are Salt Waters, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triolated Waters, Alum Waters, out of which the water being boiled away, Salt, Vitriol, and Alum are drawn; nor may they conveniently be uſed as baths. But ſome contain in them the Spirits of Metals, and therefore in regard of the very great active and penetrating Faculty which they have, they are Medicinally uſed, both to drink and to Bathe in; ſuch are the hot Baths, the acid and brackiſh Waters.</p>
                  <p>Now whence theſe Waters have their faculties,
<note place="margin">Whence metalline waters have their virtue.</note> Authors are not agreed. Some conceive they have their Virtue from the Minerals and Metals through which they flow. But this is not likely to be true. For ſince the Bodies of Metals are ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, the Water which flows over them cannot ſo eaſily draw in their Forces; and if Mineral and Metalline Waters did thus gain their Virtues, we ſhould have more of them. This indeed is true, that Minerals, as Vitriol, Alum, and ſuch like, are corporeally mixed with the Water; and therefore they are ſeparated from the Waters by boyling: Howbeit thoſe Waters wherewith the Minerals are mixed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bodily, do not gain thoſe Virtues which the true Mineral Waters have, out of which the Metalline Bodies cannot be ſeparated. But Merals cannot communicate their Faculties to Waters, only by the Waters running over them.</p>
                  <p>And Experience doth witneſs that many ſprings breaking out of high Hills do bring out with them Gold, Silver, Copper, Iron, Tin, Lead, <hi>Lapis Lazuli,</hi> the Armenian Stone; and yet they have no faculty of any of thoſe Metals which they carry and drive forth, but may be drunk as ordinary Waters.</p>
                  <p>Moreover if thoſe Waters ſhould gain their Virtues only by waſhing the Metals in their Courſe; the Virtues of the next Veins through which they flow had been long ſince exhauſted: whereas nevertheleſs theſe Waters have had the ſame Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues for many Ages together, and do ſtill retain the ſame. Moreover out of thoſe metalline Waters no Metals can be drawn forth, either by diſtillation, boyling or any other way.</p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:35070:73"/>
                  <p> Moſt likely therefore it is, that thoſe waters take their Virtues from the firſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Metals, which is a ſubtile, Fluid, and ſpirituous ſubſtance, not yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted nor coagulated into a ſolid Metalline Body. For theſe ſpirits of the Metals are mixed with the waters, and communicate all their Vartues to them. For as out of Vitriol, Sulphur, Yea and Metals themſelves, by force of Fire ſpirits are drawn, which being mingled with water do communicate their Virtues thereunto: even ſo Nature alſo, in that great Circulatory the Earth, in the generation of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals produces ſpirits, which being mixed with neighbouring Waters and ſuch as run by, do beſtow their Virtues upon them.</p>
                  <p>Nor doth a leſs difficulty occurre in ſearching the Cauſe of hot Baths.
<note place="margin">The Cauſe of the heat of Baths.</note> Some at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute the Cauſe to the Suns heat, others to winds gathering hot Exhalations into one place: but without any probability. Others think they have their heat from the <hi>Lapis Calcarius</hi> or Chalk Stone ſo called. But neither is this probable. For the <hi>Lapis Calcarius</hi> doth not heat water unleſs it be firſt reduced into Lime by Fire. And ſuppoſe that thoſe Stones were Calcined by the Fire under ground, yet could not that heat be perpetually continued. For after that the Lime-ſtone is once ſoaked in Water, it will afterward no more become hot.</p>
                  <p>Others therefore do more probably deduce the cauſe of the heat of Baths from the Fire which is in the Bowels of the Earth, and that the Waters do either run through thoſe hot places underground, or that in the way they are joyned to the Fire and flame, or that they run ſo long near or over the Chanels of Fire, as to grow hot thereby; or whiles the Earth is made hot by ſubterranean Fires, many Vapors are from thence lift up, which at laſt in ſome wide place turn to water, and ſome where or other ſeek their way out. Which they declare by this example. Let ſalt water be mixed with Potters Clay, and make a round Globe of the ſaid Clay, hollow within, whereinto put a Pipe, and ſtop the hole with Clay whereinto the Pipe is put; then put the Globe upon the Fire, with the Pipe from the Fire. When the Globe Waxes hot, hot Salt Water will flow out of the Globe through the Pipe.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit, ſome there are, who though they allow this manner of generation in many places; Yet ſeeing in all places where there are hot Baths there are not ſigns of any Subterranean Fire; and moreover there are Baths found, whoſe heat vaniſhes away, if you dig a little to find their original: wherefore they conceive it proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that ſome hot Baths are cauſed by two or more metalline Waters, which are cold to the touch, of their own Nature, but upon their meeting together they grow hot by the Repugnancy of Spirits. An example whereof is ſeen in ſpirits of Vitriol and Oyl or Salt of Tartar; alſo in <hi>Aquafortis</hi> and Tartar. Butter of Autimony and Spirit of Nitre: which though to the touch they are cold: yet if they are mixed they grow hot; and that in ſuch a meaſure, as if ſuddenly you pour Oyl of Tartar upon <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> wherein Iron hath been diſſolved, it will not only boyl but take flame: which alſo will happen, if you ſuddenly pour a quantity of ſpirit of Nitre upon Butter of Antimony ſo called. And therefore they conceive it rational, that when two ſprings conſiſting of a mixture of ſuch Repugnant ſpirits do meet and mix together, that the water ſhould by that means wax hot.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning the Sea, Authors are wont in the Doctrine of Meteors to handle two queſtions principally, one concerning the Saltneſs of the Sea. another tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching its Ebbing and flowing.
<note place="margin">The Cauſe of the Seas. Saltneſs.</note> Touching the Seas ſaltneſs the opinions of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents were many, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> refutes in his 2. <hi>Meteor. Cap.</hi> 3. We in this point follow <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and hold that the Sea water is not Salt of its own Nature, but that it becomes ſuch by the admixture of ſome Salt thing; which alſo is ſeen in Ley. Which alſo may be gathered from that which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the <hi>forecited place,</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> in <hi>Nat. Hiſt. Lib.</hi> 31. <hi>Cap.</hi> 6. deliver, how that hollow balls of Wax let down by Nets into the Sea, and empty veſſels ſtopped, they gather into themſelves freſh Water. For many Earthy Salt Exhalations do both fal into the Sea in ſhowers, and flow thereinto with Rivers: alſo the Sun exhals out of the Sea the moiſter and ſweeter parts of the Water, leaving behind the more heavy and Earthy. And therefore on the top the Sea is ſalter, then towards the bottom, becauſe the Sun doth more exhale the ſweet parts out of the Surface: alſo the Sea is ſalter in the Summer then in the Winter, and more in the Eaſtern and Southern parts then elſewhere; becauſe in thoſe places the Sun becams are ſtronger.</p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:35070:74"/>
                  <p> As to the Ebbing and flowing of the Sea,
<note place="margin">The Eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and flowing of the Sea how cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed?</note> there is very great difficulty, chiefly cauſed by the very great variety which is in the ſaid Motion. For in ſome places there is no ſuch motion, or it is ſcarce diſcernable: in other places it is ſo great, that vaſt ſhores lie bare, and there are places to go over dry, which were before covered with Water: in ſome places the motion is flow, in other places ſo quick, that in the ſpace of an hour or two many miles will be covered with the Flood, and as many bared by the Ebb, ſo that men can hardly run faſt enough to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the fury of the Tide coming in. Nor doth this motion keep the ſame time in all places. For the moſt part, it flows ſix hours and Ebbs as many. Yet in ſome places is flows ſeven hours and Ebbs five: in others, it flows four hours and Ebbs eight. In which Variety nevertheleſs there is this regularity, that the Eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and flowing together laſt but twelve hours. In very many places the greateſt floods are at full moon; yet in ſome places they happen at new Moon. Touching which variety of this Motion, you may read in <hi>Cardan, Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Subtil. p.</hi> 168. <hi>Scaliger.</hi> in <hi>Exercit.</hi> 52. <hi>Caſpar Contarenus</hi> in <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Elementis. Collegium Conimbric. de Met. Tr.</hi> 8. <hi>Cap.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>Now touching the Cauſe of this motion there are ſo many ſeveral opinions, that you can hardly tel which to aſſent unto. Wherefore not without Cauſe <hi>J. C. Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger</hi> in his 52 <hi>Exercit.</hi> thus writes: <hi>My common ſaying which I uſe every where, That we know nothing, is moſt ſeaſonable in this diſquiſition touching-the Motion of the Sea.</hi> And a little after. <hi>Who will not ſay that Philoſophy her ſelf can but ſtutter in this point? When he ſhall ſee almoſt in the ſame ſhoars, that it is high-water at</hi> Calicut <hi>when the Moon is full, and at the ſhoars of the River</hi> Indus, <hi>when the Moon is new. This is a point of ſubtilty which thou oughteſt to have ſearcht into,</hi> O Cardan; <hi>which if thou canſt unfold unto us, I will conſent that thou be counted the god of Philoſophers. You will askme, what ſay you to the matter? I? I did nothing but expect to hear from you. But ſeeing you appear not in this Point, I dare no. ſo much as expect my ſelf.</hi> And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if ſo great a Philoſopher doth here confeſs his own Ignorance, what can we promiſe after him ſave to reckon up the opinions of ſome Authors.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Julius Caeſar Scaliger</hi> therefore attributes the force hereof to the Moon, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides half the Heaven which is turned about in twelve hours, into two Quadrants, and that during the one the Waters do follow the Moon to the middle of Heaven ſix hours, and as many more they fall back, being driven by the repulſe of the ſhoars. But whether the encreaſe of the Sea be cauſed by rarefaction, or by addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion of new ſubſtance, he dares not determine; only he ſaies, the Sea Waters do follow the Moon, and that they are ſuſpended thereby as the Iron by the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone. And herein moſt Authors are agreed, that the Motion of the Seas Ebb and flow depends upon the Moon, and that it is terminated in twelve hours. And that becauſe the Moon doth not alwaies riſe in the ſame place, nor is alſo alwaies at the ſame time carried above the Horizon, therefore the Ebbing and flowing doth not obſerve the ſame time. Now that this motion depends on the Moon, beſides what hath been ſaid, this ſeems alſo to be a ſign, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Flood comes every day an hour later; becauſe the Moon returns to the ſame place in about the ſpace of twenty five hours. Now <hi>Scaliger</hi> in the ſame place endeavors to render a Reaſon of that variety, of ſwiftneſs, and Ceſſation in ſome places, and of other things ſeen in this Motion; from the various Scituation of places, the highneſs and lowneſs of the ſhoars, the greatneſs and narrowneſs of the Sea, the even Plainneſs of its Courſe, or the many turnings, windings and ſtraits, and the Nature and depth of the bottom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Contarenus</hi> conceives, that when the Sea flows the waters are rariſied and ſowel and are on all ſides poured out to the ſhores; and that in the Ebb the Waters are condenſed and contracted into themſelves and ſo leave the ſhoars; and that the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refaction proceeds from Heat, the force of which heat depends upon the Moon. And to explain the time of this motion, he divides the Heaven into four equal parts, with the two greateſt Circles, the Meridian and right Horizon, upon which when the Moon aſcends towards the Meridian, the water ſwels and is poured abroad; for then the beams of the Moon have greateſt force: but when the Moon is moved from the Meridian to the occidental Horizon, the water flows back again, and gathers it ſelf into it ſelf, becauſe of the weakneſs of the Raies of the Moon. But why,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:35070:74"/>when the Moon is moved from the Occidental part of the Horizon, unto that part of the Meridian which is beneath the Horizon, the Water ſhould ſwel again, and afterwards decreaſe when the Moon goes from the Subterranean Meridian to the oriental Horizon, he faies he can find no probable cauſe himſelf, nor can ſee any made out by others. Alſo he profeſſes the Cauſe is to him unknown, why in ſome places there is no Ebbing or flowing of the Sea.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Taurellus</hi> holds thus: The Sea disburthening it ſelf into the inmoſt parts of the Earth, is the cauſe that the Waters with great violence flow from all the ſhoars round about to that Gulph or inlet. For there where the Sea empties its Waters into the Cavities of the Earth, there alſo it is depreſſed and fals, that the other Waters may from all parts creep thither, which (the Caverns of the Earth being fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) being gathered from all ſides into one place, according to the Largneſs of the Sea and the force of the Waters it is raiſed aloſt, and afterward ſettles by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and returns to the ſhoars formerly forſaken, an addition alſo of Waters being made from the Rivers. Thus the whole boſome of the Sea is filled with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, til the upper Cavities of the Earth being emptied they require more Water of the Sea, to ſwallow up after the foreſaid manner.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>AFter Meteors, we are next to diſcouſe of Bodies perfectly mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Now Bodies perfectly mixed are of two ſorts: ſome life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, others living, The lifeleſs are Metals. For by that word all things bred in and digd out of the Earth are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as appears by the preface of <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> to his Fift Book. Late Writers call them in general Minerals: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Quarries and Pits whence they are digd are termed Mines.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning the Nature of all theſe kind of things,
<note place="margin">Whence Minerals have their forms?</note> this is firſt to be known; that many men conceive, that theſe Minerals and Metals con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain nothing in them beſides Elements, and that they are only ſimply mixt bodies: but herein they are miſtaken. For their operations are of a far other Nature, then that they can be deduced from the Elements alone. And therefore <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaies rightly in his <hi>Exercitation</hi> 137. <hi>Sect.</hi> 20. That <hi>every forme of a perfectly mixt Body, although it is no Soul, (as for example that of an Adamant) is a fift Nature far different from the four Elements.</hi> And in his <hi>Exercitat.</hi> 101. <hi>Sect.</hi> 14. he reprehends <hi>Cardan</hi> for beleeving, that only by the mixture of the Elements it can come to paſs that the Load-ſtone can draw Iron. For even theſe things have alſo, that I may ſo ſpeak, their Seminary forms and Virtues, put into them by God at their firſt Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; nor were they made after the Creation of the world, by the various conflict of the Elements, but were created by God; and by thoſe forms they are perpetua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:35070:75"/>and from thoſe forms proceeds not only the forming of their Bodies, (which is no leſs admirable then in ſome plants,) and their wonderful Virtues, but alſo their Propagation and Perpetuation. For the form of Minerals and Metals can mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply it ſelf; and thoſe Bodies have in their Creation a power given them by God to multiply themſelves in a fitting matter and a convenient place. Which even Nitre doth teach us. For though out of Nitrous Earth the Salt be once extracted by boiling: yet out of the Mother of Nitre, as they call it, new Nitre is generated; and that not once only, but very often; which our Salt-peter men now a daies know very well. Nor was it unknown to the Ancients, as appears from <hi>Pliny, B.</hi> 31. <hi>Cap.</hi> 10. where he writes, that the froth of Nitre was made, when the Dew had fallen, the Nitre Mines being Pregnant, but having not as yet brought forth. By reaſon of which form it comes alſo to paſs, that though in theſe Minerals there is a mutation in their external form, ſo that they are reduced into Pouders, or Liquors, or Glaſſes: yet they nevertheleſs eaſily returne into a Metalline Body; becauſe their internal form continues ſafe and ſound, as may be ſeen in Mercury, Antimony, Lead and other things. And therefore when the Queſtion is touching the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Minerals and Metals; it is not enough to have recourſe to thoſe Vapors mentioned in the Doctrine of Meteors, but there is need of more determinate and Specifick principles.</p>
                  <p>Now what theſe are, cannot in general be wel explained. For there is great variety of Minerals, which muſt firſt be propounded. Now they are by others otherwiſe divided. I think fit in this place to retain the diviſion of <hi>Albertus Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> who makes three kinds of them, Stones, Metalls, and Middle Natur'd Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als; by which Name he comprehends all the reſt, which have a certain middle Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture betwixt Stones and Metals.</p>
                  <p>And that we may begin with the laſt kind, it contains many things under it; Earths, Stones, Sulphurs, Bitumens, and ſome things mixt of theſe, coming nearer the Nature of Metals. As for what concerns <hi>Earths,</hi> we do not thereby un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the ſimple Element, nor yet that Earth which is every where plowed up by Husbandmen, and which is fit to ſow Corn and to ſet Herbs in: which though it be not ſimple, yet it comes nearer to the Nature of the Element of Earth, then the Metalline Earths do. Although here alſo is great variety, and ſome ground partakes little or nothing, another partakes much of a Metalline Nature. Now that many grounds partake much of Minerals doth hereby appear, in that when they are burnt they ſend forth a Sulphureous Vapor, as Metals and Minerals are wont to do. But by earth in this place, we underſtand a Body digd out of the ground, which partakes of a Mineral Nature, and which (water being thrown on it) diſſolves, and turns to Clay.</p>
                  <p>Among theſe kind of Earths the moſt vulgar is Argilla and Potters Clay;
<note place="margin">Potters Clay and Argilla.</note> which is a Clammy Earth, and breaks not when it is molded, nor chops when it is dried. There is alſo great variety hereof, according to which the Veſſels differ, which are made not only for Kitchin uſes, but for other Houſe occaſions, and for the uſe of Gold-Smiths that melt Metals, and for Chymiſts. For of every kind of Clay all Veſſels cannot be made, and one ſort will endure the Fire better then another: alſo one ſort wil be molded more delicate, thin and fine then another. Whence the excellency of Potters Clay is eſtimated.</p>
                  <p>After Argilla and the ſeveral ſorts of Potters Claies comes <hi>Marga</hi> or <hi>Marle.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Marga, Marle.</note> Now this is a Fat Earth, being as it were the fatneſs of the ground, and the name comes from the High-Dutch, and 'tis called <hi>Steinmarck</hi> as if you would ſay the Marrow of Stones; and it is found ſhut up amongſt Stones. Now there are ſundry kinds thereof; <hi>Pliny</hi> reckons ſix, White, Red, Dove coloured, Clayiſh, Stoney, and Gravelly. And of each of theſe there are again many different ſorts. 'Tis found in many parts of Germany, and among them the <hi>Marle</hi> of <hi>Rochlich</hi> is moſt famous; which they uſe in the ſtead of Bole-Armeniack.</p>
                  <p>To Earths alſo belongs <hi>Creta</hi> Chalke, by which name alſo Earths are underſtood, which are uſed to Poliſh, Clenſe, Rub, Paint and Colour. There are many kinds thereof, yet becauſe it is chiefly digd up in the Iſland of <hi>Creta,</hi> therefore all ſorts have borrowed their Name from it.</p>
                  <p>There are alſo many other kinds of Earth, which are uſed partly by Phyſitians, partly by other Mechanical Artiſts, which differ in Rarity or Spungineſs, in Clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineſs,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:35070:75"/>in colour, taſt and uſe. And as to their Medicinal uſe; ſome binde cool and dry, as the Eretrian, Samian, Lemnian, Armenian: ſome with their aſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on have a certain biting quality, either from Nitre, as the Chian, Selinuſian, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molian, and <hi>Pignitis,</hi> which are Abſterſive or Scouring; or from Alum, as the Melian Earths, and the Clay of many Baths, which are good for the Gout and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Ulcers: or they have in them ſome quantity of Bitumen and of Sulphur. Alſo there are ſome Earths which give a black Tincture fit to make Inke, as <hi>Calcitis, Myſi, Sori,</hi> and <hi>Copperas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The moſt renowned among theſe Earths are <hi>Terra Lemnia</hi> and Bole-Armeniack.
<note place="margin">Terra Lemnia Sigillate.</note> The former is ſo called from the Iſland wherein it is found. Alſo it is called <hi>Terra Sigillata</hi> or ſealed Earth, from the Seal imprinted thereupon. <hi>Galen</hi> avers that he ſaw with his own Eyes a certain hill near the City <hi>Epheſtiades,</hi> wherein no plant grows, the ſoil being as it were burnt up, of a red colour, out of which the Earth is digd. Alſo that there were three differences thereof: that one was of a red colour, but not ſtaining the hands, being the moſt excellent of all, which the Prieſt might only touch, as a ſacred thing; and he ſealed it with <hi>Diana</hi> her ſignet, which was the Picture of a Goat: the other was red Oker which did colour the hands of the touchers; the third was uſed to ſcour Cloathes, becauſe of its clenſing faculty. Thoſe who at this day ſail to the Iſland of <hi>Lemnos,</hi> do ſay that it is gathered in the Dog-daies in a mooriſh ground, that it is ſigned with a certain Seal and ſent to the great Turk, and that therefore it is hard to come by, and not publickly ſold. But theſe ſealed Cakes have not all the markes of the old <hi>Terra Lemnia.</hi> Now the old <hi>Terra Lemnia</hi> had an excellent Faculty to reſiſt the Plague and Malignant Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</p>
                  <p>Bole Armeniack or Earth of <hi>Armenia</hi> was brought out of that part of <hi>Armenia</hi> which is next to <hi>Cappadocia.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bole-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meniack.</note> It was of a pale colour, would quickly be reduced to fine powder like as Chalk will, being held in the Mouth it would melt like Butter: it was drying and binding; and therefore it was uſed for the <hi>Dyſentery,</hi> the looſneſs of the Belly, and ſpitting of Blood; for Catarrhes, and Ulcers of the Lungs: alſo it was good againſt the Plague.</p>
                  <p>Moreover there are many other Earths, <hi>Eretria, Samia, Selinuſia, Chia, Cimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, Pignites, Melia, Rubrica,</hi> and <hi>Sinopica,</hi> Precious Earths ſo called moſt of them from the places where they were digged. Of which ſee <hi>Pliny</hi> Book 35. Ch. 16. and 17.</p>
                  <p>And indeed the Ancients uſed ſuch Earths as were then known to them, and were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rought out of neighbouring places; and ſeeing we have hardly now any certain notice of many of them, and the Quarries of the Ancients by injuries of time and the change of Empires are either unknown or exhauſted, and every where in other places and in our Countries the like Earths are found: it is better to aſcribe the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of theſe Earths to the kind then the place, and to value every one according to its own Nature, and to try the Vertues of Earths by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>For there is in <hi>Hungaria Bolus Tockavienſis,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bolus Tockevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enfis.</note> which <hi>Crato</hi> in his Epiſtles tels us that it will melt in the louth like Butter, and hath all the ſigns of true Bole-Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack, and is very good againſt Catarrhs; and he prefers it far before the Bole-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meniack which we have at this day, yea before that which was brought the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror out of Turky. He ſaies he found by experience that it holp many of the Plague at <hi>Vienna.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover there is the <hi>Terra Sigillata</hi> of <hi>Sileſia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Terra sigill at a of Sileſia.</note> which is preferred before the <hi>Ferra Lemnia</hi> and the Turkiſh Earths which we have at this day. For it is now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by many experiments, that it hath rare Virtues againſt the Plague, Malignant Feavers, the bitings of Venemous Beaſts, the looſneſs, and the Bloody flux. The Chymiſts call it <hi>Axungia Solis.</hi> The finder out thereof was <hi>Johannes Montanus</hi> a <hi>Sileſian,</hi> who publiſhed a Writing or Treatiſe concerning the ſame, how that Gold was changed by the ordination of God and Provident Nature into a moſt excellent prepared Medicine, eſpecially good againſt Poiſons, no leſs then thoſe Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are made with great Coſt of Hungarian Gold. And if that be true, I wonder why it is diſſoled rather with Spirit of Vitriol then Spirit of Salt.</p>
                  <p>There is alſo found another about <hi>Lignitium</hi> and <hi>Gold-berg</hi> in <hi>Silefia,</hi> which the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:35070:76"/>Chymiſts term <hi>Axungia Lunae:</hi> and in many other places other ſuch Earths are found. And therefore, as I ſaid before, theſe kind of Earths are not ſo much to be eſteemed according to the places, as their own peculiar Natures. And becauſe they have all their Virtues from Minerals and Metals, when we would judg of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of any ſort of Earth, we muſt conſider with what Mineral or Metal it hath affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. And now we proceed to other things of this kind.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>AS concerning Salt, there are many kinds thereof. Firſt, There is common Salt: which again is threefold: digd Salt, Sea-Salt, and that which is boiled out of Salt Fountains.
<note place="margin">The Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Salt</note> Now what the original of Salt is, is not ſo manifeſt. 'Tis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſaid to be engendred of a warty and thick Earthy Juyce mingled together. But this doth not ſufficiently explain the matter, nor is the cauſe rendred why it is found only in ſome certain places. The more probable opinion and moſt likely is, that Salt as other minerals and Metals, was at the beginning of the World crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Earth, wherein it ſtil Preſerves and Multiplies it ſelf, by a faculty placed therein by the Creator. For if the ſimple Elements, in ſo many Mutations and Viciſſitudes of Sublunary things, do preſerve and multiply themſelves, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine entire, from the beginning of the world to this very day: I ſee no cauſe, why we ſhould deny the ſame power to theſe Bodies. For that which was before ſaid of Nitre, is true of common Salt. And therefore it is not bred in all places, but in thoſe only where that ſpirit, (or Seminary principle, if I may ſo cal it,) is preſent; as Nitre is bred only in that Earth, in which there is the Mother of Salt-Peter. And from the principle of Salt, in the Caverns of the Earth, where there is no great ſtore of moiſture, <hi>Sal Foſſilis</hi> or digd Salt is bred. And according as that matter which by the Principle and ſpirit of Salt is coagulated into a Body, is purer or impurer: ſo this digd Salt is bred purer or impurer, and ſome is blackiſh and dark colourd, otherſome is white and tranſparent like Chriſtal, which is called <hi>Sal Gem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if the ſaid principle of Salt be mixed with much humidity and Waters ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding through the Caverns of the Earth; Salt Fountains, out of which Salt is boiled do thence ariſe. Some indeed conceive that Salt Fountains ariſe from the Sea. But the Sea Water doth not contain ſo much Salt in it as many Salt Fountains do; which experience doth teach. Nor let any man ſay, that the Waters while they flow through the Caverns of the Earth do exhale, and are conſumed by the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground Heat, and that ſo ſome Fountains come to be Salter then the Sea. For if this were ſo, the Salt Fountains which are farther from the Sea ſhould contain more Salt in them then thoſe that are nearer, which nevertheleſs agrees not with Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. Others conceive that Salt Fountains proceed from waters which run through the Caverns of the Earth containing much digd-Salt in them. But, though this cannot be abſolutely denied; yet the queſtion is whence that ground Salt hath its Original and Durability. For if Fountains were made Salt only by their Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters flowing through ground-Salt, they would not laſt ſo many Ages; but the ground Salt being melted into the Waters would be conſumed, but eſpecially thoſe Fountains would not alwaies afford a like quantity of Salt, ſeeing the Salt being melted by the running by of neighbouring Waters would be waſhed away. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt of neceſſity add the Spirit of Salt, the primary principle of the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Salt.</p>
                  <p>Sea-Salt is made of the Sea water, the Hear of the Sun conſuming the Watry moiſture. And if the Heat of the Sun be not ſufficient, it is perfected by Fire: and to make it whiter and purer, it is purged by Solution and Coagulation. There are alſo certain Lakes, which by the Heat of the Summers Sun, turn to Salt, whence we have the Tarentine and Phrygian Salt.</p>
                  <p>The chief uſe of Salt is to Seaſon Meats,
<note place="margin">The uſe of Salt.</note> and all the Spice in the world will not make meat pleaſant, without Salt. It Hearts, Dries, Scours, and conſumes ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſluous moiſture, and therefore preſerves from putrefaction. And although it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſends from Putrefaction, yet is it not good in putrid Feavers; not only becauſe it is Hot, but becauſe it dries too much.</p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:35070:76"/>
                  <p> Beſide Salt uſed in food, there is another ground-Salt,
<note place="margin">Ammonias Salt.</note> called <hi>Armeniacus</hi> or <hi>Ammoniacus,</hi> cal'd ſo from <hi>Ammos</hi> the Sand, becauſe it is found under the Sand congealed into plates, in the <hi>Cyrenaick</hi> Countrey. It was of a blackiſh color, and ill taſted. And therefore it is now adaies out of uſe; and Sal Gem is uſed in ſtead thereof. But that Sal Armeniack which is commonly now ſo called, and which the Chymiſts uſe, is made by Art. It is made of five parts of Mans Urine and one part of common-Salt, and half a part of the Soot of Wood, boiled together til the moiſture be conſumed. That which remains is ſublimed, diſſolved again and coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated.</p>
                  <p>This Salt is extreamly volatile, and renders all fixt things volatile, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chymiſts uſe it in the Solution and Sublimation of Metals. And in Plants and Animals, ſince there is found both a fixt and Volatile Salt, the Volatile is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Chymiſts called <hi>Sal Armeniac.</hi> Concerning Salt ſee <hi>Pliny Lib.</hi> 31. <hi>Nat. Hiſt. Cap.</hi> 7. and 9. and <hi>Dioſcorides, Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Cap.</hi> 85.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Nitre alſo it ſelf belongs to the family of Salts,
<note place="margin">Nitre or Salt Petre.</note> and it is bred in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar kind of the Earth, upon Walls and Rocks, where it ſprouts out like white down, and therefore 'tis cal'd <hi>Sal-Petrae Salt-Petre,</hi> that is Salt of the Rock. Alſo they relate that it breeds of it ſelf in <hi>Aſia,</hi> for it drops down in Caves and is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered and dried afterward in the Sun. The Lydian is the beſt, which is known to be true by its lightneſs and crumbling, and color almoſt Purple. This ſort is called <hi>Aphronitrum,</hi> as if you would ſay, the froth of Nitre. Alſo it was bred of its own accord in <hi>Macedonia</hi> among the Ancients, by the Coagulation of Water, and they cal'd it <hi>Chalaſticum,</hi> being white and pure, and the likeſt to Salt. By Art and boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it is extracted out of the Nitrous Earths. Now this ſame Salt is of a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Nature. For to ſight it appears white; to the touch cold: yet it contains in it a Spirit exceeding Red, Hot, and extreamly apt to take flame, and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a Fiery Nature. All the ſtrength of Gun-pouder proceeds from Nitre, only Brim-ſtone makes it ſpeedily take fire: yet becauſe all the Sulphur is not inflamed as it were in a moment, but ſucceſſively and by parts; but Nitre after it hath once taken Fire ſuddenly and forcibly burns all away, (and becauſe being ſet on Fire it cannot be contained in the Room wherein it was before; and beſides the Nitre and Sulphur are as it were Enemies:) hence comes that ſame thundering force of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouder. The Chymiſts take Nitre wel purified before and purifie it yet further,
<note place="margin">Sal Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nellae.</note> by caſting into it when it is melted over the Fire divers parcels of Sulphur; and this they call <hi>Nitrum Praeparatum</hi> and <hi>Sal Prunellae,</hi> becauſe it is of rare uſe in burning Feavers, eſpecially thoſe wherein the Tongue and Throat is inflamed, which infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is called <hi>Prunella.</hi> Concerning Nitre ſee <hi>Pliny,</hi> in <hi>Hiſt. Nat. Book</hi> 31. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Of the Family of Salts is alſo Alum, called by the Greeks <hi>Stupteria,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Alum.</note> becauſe of its vehement aſtringency. For all ſorts of Alum do Heat, Bind, purge putrid Ulcers, dry up moiſture, quel proud fleſh, and therefore it is uſed in many Medicaments ordained for Ulcers. It is found in its mines, and is extracted by boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. And where Alum is bred, there commonly is found Vitriol and Sulphur. And as it is boiled it contains much fattineſs in it, which cannot be ſeparated but by mans Urin, which being poured thereon, it makes it fall to the bottom. <hi>Dioſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides</hi> reckons three kinds thereof; Digd-Alum, Round Alum, Liquid Alum.
<note place="margin">Kinds of Alum.</note> There are now more kinds known. The firſt is <hi>Alumen Rupeum</hi> or <hi>Rochae, Rock-Alum</hi> or <hi>Roche-Alum;</hi> which Greek word <hi>Rocha</hi> ſerves the greateſt part of Europe to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie a Rock, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaith in <hi>Exercit.</hi> 104. <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. Alſo they call it Ice-Alum becauſe 'tis congealed in the form of Ice; and Roman Alum. This is moſt uſed in ſtead of the Natural ſorts, and is made in the Roman Territory, of a certain Stone burnt. <hi>Scaliger, in the place forecited,</hi> ſhews all the manner of the work. Then there is <hi>Alumen Saccbarinum,</hi> made up like a Sugar-Loaf, of Roche Alum, the whites of Egs and Roſe-water, for Women to beautifie their Skins. <hi>Alumen Squam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſum</hi> or <hi>Alumen Scajolae</hi> (for <hi>Scaja</hi> and <hi>Scalia</hi> ſignifie a Cruſt or Scale, <hi>Scaliger Exercit.</hi> 104. <hi>Sect.</hi> 7.) 'tis made of a Scaly Stone, tranſparent like Glaſs, which being burnt divides into plates, and grows white like Plaſter. Moreover there is a ſort of Alum made of Lees of Wine, burnt in the Fire. Alſo <hi>Alumen Catinum,</hi> made of the Aſhes of the Plant <hi>Kali</hi> or <hi>Soda.</hi> But theſe are rather Artificial and Compound Salts of Plants, ſuch as Chymiſts do at this day make, of all ſorts of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:35070:77"/>Plants. To the kinds of Alum is referred alſo <hi>Lapis Amiantos, Alumen Plumoſum,</hi> Fetherd-Alum; which nevertheleſs is not properly Alum, nor hath it the ſame fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties with other ſorts of Alums. It grows in Mineral Quarries, Interwoven as it were amongſt the ſtones; being ſo fixt that it will bear the Fire; whence ſome term it <hi>Linum Vivum.</hi> Concerning Alum ſee <hi>Pliny</hi> in <hi>Nat. Hiſt. Lib.</hi> 35. <hi>Chap</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly,
<note place="margin">Vitriol</note> Amongſt the Salts there is <hi>Vitriol</hi> ſo called from its Glaſſie clearneſs, and by the Greeks <hi>Chalcanthon,</hi> by the Latins <hi>Atramentarium</hi> Blacking, becauſe Skins and other things were therewith died black. This kind of Salt is of an admirable, and perfectly fiery Nature, and contains in it a burning Sulphur; and therfore it performs more then other Salts, in the diſſolving, colouring and generating of Metals; and the ſpirit thereof changes Iron into Copper. Now it contains in it two ſpirits, the firſt white, of great and known uſe in Phyſick; the other red; and in the Earth at laſt remains the fixed Salt. Now Vitriol is either Natural, Congealed in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns of the Earth, or dropping therefrom; or elſe Artificial, which is boiled out of certain Vitrolous Stones, or out of a ruſty kind of Earth, or out of an Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour'd Earth, ſpeckled with green and red Spots, which nevertheleſs makes no difference in the eſſence of the thing: even as Salt digd out of the Earth, and that boiled out of Salt Fountains differ not eſſentially. Other differences are rather to be obſerved, whence alſo the difference of virtues depends. For although all Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol do partake of the Nature of Braſs, and therefore vitriolated Water changes Iron into Copper, which is practiſed in <hi>Hungaria</hi> and at <hi>Goſlaria:</hi> yet ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes more of the Nature of Braſs or Copper, and other of the Nature of Iron; and therefore ſome is of a Blew, other of a Green Colour, and that either a deep Green or a light Green. The Blew partakes of the Nature of Copper; the Green, of Iron. And that is beſt which is of a deep and pleaſant colour, and tranſparent. The Cyprian, Roman and Hungarian are commended; nor is that a baſe ſort which is found in ſome parts of <hi>Sileſia.</hi> The beſt now adaies is made by Chymiſts out of Copper, of a delicate Azure colour: which they term <hi>Vitriolum Veneris.</hi> There is alſo white Vitriol ſo called. Now Vitriol heats and is aſtringent, conſumes moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, contracts the fleſh, dries, and preſerves moiſt fleſh from corruption. The Ancients alſo gave it inwardly, to kill Worms and to reſiſt the Poiſon of Toad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtools. But now, as was ſaid, a ſpirit is drawn out of it, which is more ſafely given, and hath a rare faculty to dry and reſiſt Putrefaction; and therefore it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably uſed in putrid Feavers and Peſtilences. See of Vitriol, <hi>Pliny Lib.</hi> 34. <hi>Nat. Hiſt. Cap.</hi> 12.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THe Third kind of Subterraneal Bodies or Minerals we told you were Bitumen and Sulphur in their ſeveral ſorts; <hi>viz.</hi> All ſuch things as are Oyly and Fat, and are therefore eaſily mingled with Oyl; whether they be liquid or dry. And that ſomwhat may be ſaid in general touching the original of them all;
<note place="margin">The origi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nal of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumen and ſulphur.</note> 'tis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly held, that theſe kind of bodies are bred in the bowels of the Earth, of an Hot and Dry Exhalation. But what was ſaid before of Earths and Salts, the ſame muſt now be ſaid of the ſorts of Bitumen and Sulphure, and afterwards of Metals; that we deny not the mixture of the Elements in theſe things; but ſeeing there is no ſpecifick Form of any Natural Body, which had not God for its author in the firſt Creation of the World, we muſt needs hold, that theſe things have not begun to be after the Creation of the world, by Reaſon of the Various concourſe, Fight, and mixture of the Elements, but that they were made by almighty God at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the World, and that they received from the ſame Author this mixture which they have, with their Specifick Form, and a power to multiply themſelves, and to change fitting matter into themſelves.
<note place="margin">Where Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumen and ſulphur are generated.</note> Whence it is, that though there are no where wanting Elements that may be mixed; yet cannot Bitumen and Sulphur be bred in all places, any more then Salts and Metals; but there only where the Specifick Form of Bitumen and Sulphur is found; which when new Bitumen and Sulphur is ingendred, is the principal Cauſe and Directrix of the mixture of the Elements. And therefore though we grant that ſuch Bodies conſiſt of Elements: yet we deny that they have their Forms from the Elements, but here alſo make uſe
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:35070:77"/>of that paſſage of <hi>Scaliger</hi> formerly cited, out of <hi>Exercitat.</hi> 137. <hi>Sect.</hi> 20. that every form of every perfectly mixt Body, as of an Adamant, though it be no Soul, is a fift Nature, far differing from the Elements.</p>
                  <p>And although we grant that the Matter of Bitumen and Sulphur are Elements:
<note place="margin">The matter of Sulphur and bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> yet are they only the remote matter: but the immediate matter and whereof all ſorts of Bitumen and Sulphur do partake, is a ſimple ſimilary Body apt to take flame, and Fat, and which may in general be termed Bitumen and Sulphur, as you pleaſe: where with afterwards when the Salts concure, eſpecially that of Nitre, Waters and other things, either Spirituous or Fluid, or Dry and Earthy Metallick Concretions, (the formative principle directing all to ſome certain form) thence are made ſundry ſorts of Bitumen and Sulphur. Now Bitumen and Sulphur are bred in the Earth, or in this Globe conſiſting of Earth and Water. For although ſome ſuch thing ſomtimes falls out of the Aire: yet was it firſt drawn up in form of an Exhalation out of the Mines into the Air, where being coagulated it falls down again. Now when it is ingendred in the Eartus Caverns it is voided forth either into the Sea, and is there caſt aſhore; or it flows out of the Earth, either alone or with Fountain Waters, or it is digged up. And there is ſcarce any Region in the World, wherein ſome ſort of Bitumen and Sulphur is not found.
<note place="margin">Bitumen is apt to take flame.</note> Now aptitude to take flame is proper to al Bitumen, and after it hath once taken flame, to burn fiercely, and if Water be ſparingly poured on, not to be extinguiſhed but to burn more furiouſly. The Reaſon whereof is, becauſe ſuch Bituminous ſubſtances, after they conceive flame, do not only take flame on the top, as Wood and other things, but they do totally take fire and break into flame. Whence it comes to paſs, that though the outer ſurface be wet with Water; yet the inner part which alſo flames receives not the wet, but rather gathering it ſelf into it ſelf it grows more ſtrong, diſſipates its Enemy Water, and flames more luſtily. And hence alſo it comes to paſs, that ſome mixtures of Bitumen do burn under the Water it ſelf.
<note place="margin">The effects of Bitumen.</note> And the burnings of certa in Mountains, Territories and Waters, do proceed from Bitumen and Sulphur. Now all Bituminous Bodies have the Faculty and Heating and Diſcuſſing; and therefore Fountains and Baths that have Bitumen and Sulphur in them are profitably uſed to diſſipate cold Humors, in Palſies, Epilepſies, and ſuch like Diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>And there is a great variety of ſuch Bituminous Bodies.
<note place="margin">The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Bitumens.</note> Yet they are all redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to two kinds, whereof one is liquid, which flows like Oyl, the other coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and condenſated. And again there are many ſorts of both. The Liquid, which go all under the Name of <hi>Aſphaltum,</hi> are <hi>Naphtha, Petroleum,</hi> Liquid Bitumen pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly ſo called, or Native liquid Pitch.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Naphtha</hi> in the firſt place is the liquid part of Babylonian Bitumen,
<note place="margin">Naphtha.</note> being Hot, Dry, and of a Nature perfectly Spitituous and Fiery; which hath ſo much Affinity with Fire, that the flame will leap to it at a diſtance, and it may eaſily be ſet on Fire by the heat of the Sun. And therefore <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his <hi>Alexander,</hi> writes, that <hi>Naphtha</hi> was by ſome called <hi>Medeas</hi> Medicament with which ſhe ſmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Crown and Vail of the Daughter of Creon, and ſo burnt her. What if <hi>Hercules</hi> coming to the Altar to ſacrifice, with a Garment ſmeared with <hi>Naptha,</hi> his Garment caught flame, and ſo he was burnt; and this was the Blood of the Centaure <hi>Neſſus,</hi> of whom the Poets Fable? Of whom <hi>Ovid, Metamorph. L. 9. Fab.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>It is queſtion'd amongſt Authors, whether <hi>Naphtha</hi> ſhould be called by the Name of Bitumen, or Sulphur, or Oyl. But ſeeing theſe Names are not alwaies uſed in the ſame manner, you ſhal not offend, whether you cal it an Oyl, <hi>viz</hi> a Native Mineral Oyl, or a moſt delicate Bitumen. Indeed, it is a bituminous Spirit; and it ſeems to be to Bitumen as ſpirit of Wine is to Wine, and Spirit of Turpentine to Turpentine. The moſt pure and excellent kind of <hi>Naphtha</hi> is white: yet they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that there is alſo found a Yellowiſh, and alſo a black ſort.</p>
                  <p>By Reaſon of its extream aptneſs to take flame, 'tis hardly uſed about any thing:
<note place="margin">The Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of Naphtha.</note> otherwiſe among all the ſorts of Bitumens, it is moſt Hot, Dry, and piercing. And therefore it may be uſed as an Oyntment to diſcuſs cold Humors, alſo for Cholicks ſleepy Diſeaſes, Apoplexies and Palſies. Concerning <hi>Naphtha</hi> ſee <hi>Dioſcorides, Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 85. and <hi>Matthiolus</hi> and others that have commented upon <hi>Dioſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides.</hi>

                  <p> Next to <hi>Naphtha</hi> is <hi>Petroleum,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Petroleum.</note> as if you would ſay <hi>Petrae Oleum,</hi> Oyl of the Rock, becauſe it diſtils out of Rocks, with a very ſtrong ſmel. It is a Bituminous Oyl not ſo ſubtile, nor ſo ſpirituous as <hi>Naphtha;</hi> and therefore it neither takes flame at a diſtanc, nor ſo ſuddenly. 'Tis of a various colour; the beſt is white;
<note place="margin">Liquid Succinum &amp; Liquid Ambar.</note> the worſe Yellow, Red, Black. Hitherto belongs liquid <hi>Succinum</hi> and Liquid-Ambar, which are nothing but certain ſorts of <hi>Petroleum.</hi> It is found in many Regions. In <hi>Italy,</hi> in the Country of <hi>Mutinum,</hi> it drops out of the Rocks, white and Red, of a very ſtrong ſmel; in <hi>Sicily</hi> it ſwims upon their fountains, and they cal it <hi>Oleum Siculum,</hi> and uſe it for Lamps inſtead of the Oyl, and alſo <hi>Pliny</hi> commends it for Scabby Cattle. But it is found in very many places beſides; nor muſt we eſteem it from the place, but according to its Nature. It is al of an heating drying faculty; by reaſon of the thinneſs of its Eſſence it penetrates, and diſcuſſes excrementitious Humors, and therefore it is good againſt the Palſie, and Cold pains and Diſeaſes of other parts, eſpecially the Nervous parts.</p>
                  <p>In the Third place is liquid Bitumen,
<note place="margin">Liquid Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumen.</note> ſo called by tranſlation of the general term to one ſpecial ſort; it is thicker then <hi>Petroleum,</hi> which they mingle with Tallow, to Smear the Axletrees of Coaches and Carts. If black Pitch be mingled therewith, it ſerves alſo to Pitch Ships and is called <hi>Piſſaſphaltus.</hi> Now theſe three, <hi>Naphtha, Petroleum,</hi> and <hi>Bitumen Liquidum,</hi> ſeem to differ, not in original, ſeeing they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree for the moſt part in one Root, but in the thinneſs of their parts; ſo that the thinneſt and moſt ſpirituous is termed <hi>Naphtha;</hi> the middle and Oyly ſort, <hi>Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leum;</hi> and the thicker and more dreggy is called <hi>Bitumen Liquidum</hi> in a ſpecial manner. And the difference of theſe Bitumens may eaſily be obſerved in the diſtillation of Ambar: wherein, that which is thickeſt and remains at the bottom reſembles the Pitchy Bitumen; the Oyl reſembles the <hi>Petroleum;</hi> and the moſt ſubtile part reſembles <hi>Naphtha,</hi> and like it doth alſo ſnatch the flame to it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Finally,
<note place="margin">Maltha.</note> Amongſt the Bitumens is <hi>Maltha,</hi> although it ſeems not to be meer Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumen, but a Liquor thereof mixt with a Clayiſh ſlime; of which <hi>Pliny Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Nat.

<note place="margin">Ambar Greece.</note> Ambra Griſea,</hi> Ambar Greece <hi>[that is Ambar gray, or gray Amber, for Greize and Greizely ſignifie gray, though now obſolete.]</hi> Now the Name of Ambar is vulgarly uſed for all the kinds of Succinum.

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:35070:78"/>the moſt part brittle, yet ſo that under the Teeth and Nailes it may be wrought and drawn out like Maſtick. The colour ſomtimes is uniforme, and hath otherwhiles yellowiſh or white ſpecks interſperſed. And although it be found in the Sea, yet is it not bred in the Sea, but is a kind of Bitumen or Oyl flowing out of its fountains, and being on the top of the Sea expoſed to the Air it is Condenſed and Coagulated like <hi>Succinum</hi> or white and yellow Amber. And the Hiſtories of the Indian Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages do teſtifie that in ſome places of <hi>India</hi> a moſt noble Oyl or Balſam flows out of certaine Fountains. That ſame moſt grateful and pleaſing ſmel ſprings from a moſt noble kind of Sulphur. Yea, <hi>Crato</hi> writes that it is Sulphur, or that there is Sulphur in Ambar Greece.
<note place="margin">The Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of Ambar Greece.</note> It hath a rare faculty to Roborate the Animal and Vital faculties: and therefore it is good for the Brain and Heart, and makes al the ſenſes more lively.

                  <p>After Ambar Greece, follow <hi>Succinum,</hi> yellow Ambar,
<note place="margin">Succinum <hi>or yellow Ambar.</hi>
                     </note> which the Greeks call <hi>Electron,</hi> the Arabians <hi>Carabe,</hi> alſo <hi>Ambra Citrina</hi> yellow Ambar (in way of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the foreſaid Ambar which is called <hi>Gryſea</hi> or <hi>Chryſea</hi>) alſo <hi>Gagates</hi> and <hi>Vernix.</hi> That is now beſt known which is found on the ſhoar of <hi>Boruſſia</hi> by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean Sea, in ſhape of a Maſs or Clod without any form or Figure, hard and ſolid like a Stone, ſomtimes pure and ſincere, ſomtimes mixt with Herbs, Woods, little inſects, a certain black vitriol, and other filth. Hence ſome Lumps are tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparent and clear, ſome dark: the color is alſo various; the ſmel pleaſing in its kind. Being rubbed with a cloath it draws to it dry Chat and Straws, by its ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit going forth. Being put to the flame of a Candle it takes fire, flames and ſends out much ſooty Vapor.</p>
                  <p>Touching its Nature and Generation there are ſundry opinions, whiles ſome hold it to be a vegetable, others a Mineral, others partly vegetable and partly Mineral; all which here to relate, (with the Reaſons which are brought to confirm each opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.) and to examine the ſame, would be too tedious. We ſhal propound therefore only that opinion which is moſt likely to be true: <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Succinum</hi> or yellow Ambar is a kind of Bitumen. For it hath all the proprieties thereof, and it is got out of Mines in the Earth, in <hi>Germany, France, Italy,</hi> and it hath been found on the outſide Coagulated and abſolute Ambar; and within pure <hi>Naphtha</hi> or <hi>Petroleum.</hi> Alſo that <hi>Melanteria, Chalcitis,</hi> and other Minerals did grow to Ambar. Finally, By Chymical Art an Oyl is drawn out of it, agreeing with <hi>Petroleum.</hi> And this Bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, according as it is White, Yellow, or Red, Black, Pure or Impure, ſo the like <hi>Succinum</hi> or Ambar is bred thereof. Now it doth nor conſiſt only of Bitumen, but alſo an Aluminous, Nitrous and Vitriolated ſpirit do concur; and therefore in many places where there is <hi>Petroleum</hi> no <hi>Succinum</hi> is bred, becauſe theſe ſpirits are wanting. Now, At firſt <hi>Succinum</hi> or Ambar is liquid, but afterwards when it is ſhed into the Waters, without any Exhalation of parts and evaporation, it is Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated and grows hard by means of a Nitrous, Aluminous, and Vitriolated ſpirit, the Saltneſs of the Sea alſo, Peradventure, Concurring. And that theſe are the immediate principles of Ambar or <hi>Succinum,</hi> Chymical reſolution it ſelf doth ſhew. For a Vitriolated, Aluminous, Salt ſpirit comes out with the flegm: and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over good ſtore of Salt ſticks to the Neck of the Retort. In its Rectification, if the work be diligently plied, a white ſpirit aſcends, like the <hi>Naphtha Babylonica,</hi> which takes flame, ſo that it is not ſafe to hold lighted Candles near the Veſſels wherein <hi>Succinum</hi> or yellow Ambar is diſtilled. A twofold Oyl may be drawn forth. Yellow and Red anſwering to <hi>Petroleum.</hi> The black Feces or Dregs, if it be ſuffered to ſtil till it is dry, do grow together into a Bitumen very like that of <hi>Iudea.</hi>

<note place="margin">Jet.</note> It is alſo a kind of Bitumen, or a Bituminous ſtone, for the moſt part black; yet ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time of a pale or yellow colour. 'Tis ſoon ſet on Fire, ſmels like Bitumen. It

                  <p>There is yet another kind of Bitumen,
<note place="margin">Aſphaltus.</note> but more concrete, which is called by the general Name <hi>Aſphaltus.</hi> It is an hard kind of <hi>Aſphaltus</hi> or Bitumen, and hath no filth mixt with it. It is of a ſolid ſubſtance, and ſhines like purple when it is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. It is weighty and of a ſtrong ſmel. Of this kind, that of <hi>Sodom</hi> is the beſt. That which is more impure doth not ſhine ſo, nor hath ſo ſtrong a ſmel. It Dries and Heats, Diſcuſſes, Molliſies, and ſodders Ulcers: it takes away fits of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a Suffumigation. See <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> in his 1 <hi>Book, Chap.</hi> 83. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries of <hi>Matthiolus</hi> and others.</p>
                  <p>Finally, To the Family of Bitumens are to be referred certain Bicuminous Earths and Stones. For it matters not much whether you cal them Earths or ſtones. Their firſt and chief Original is from Bitumen, with which as there is more or leſs of an Earthy and Stony matter conjoyned, ſo it receives this or that Name. And hence it is that in the Nature of Bitumens we meet with great difficulty, whiles Writers regarding the places where they are bred, or the outward Figure, but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle conſidering the internal Nature, either they ſeparate things of the ſame kind, or confound and Joyn together things of different kinds.</p>
                  <p>For this Bitumen of which ſuch kinds of Earths and Stones do conſiſt, is not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and pure Bitumen, but mixt with Earthy Juyces, Mud, Potters Clay, Veins of Metal and Stones.
<note place="margin">Terra Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelitis.</note> Of this kind is <hi>Terra Ampelitis</hi> ſo called, which is black like Sea-Coals, and reſembling Bitumen; it diſſolves in Oyl, reſiſts worms, and Dries and ſoftens as <hi>Aſphaltus</hi> doth. Some account this <hi>Ampelitis</hi> Earth and Pit-Coals to be all one, but others make a difference. If they are not juſt one and the ſame, at leaſt they are much of kin; whence come the ſundry Names of the Germans which they give theſe kind of Bodies, as <hi>Schwartſe, Kreide, Koblerde, Steinkehlen, Bergkolen, Dorff, and Durpte.</hi> For theſe kinds whether of Stones or Earths, have all one Root and Mother, <hi>viz.</hi> Black Bitumen: the Particular difference proceeds from the Various manner of Concretion and Admixture of other things.</p>
                  <p>For that which the Germans cal <hi>Dorff,</hi> and <hi>Durpte,</hi> Peat and Turfe, are Bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous Earths which they Cut and Dry for Fewel. It is digged in <hi>Weſt-Friſe-Land, Gelderland, Flanders, Brabant, Zeland.</hi> It is alſo found in <hi>Collao</hi> a Province of <hi>Peru,</hi> which <hi>Monardus</hi> deſcribes in theſe words. In <hi>Collao</hi> a Province of <hi>Peru</hi> there is a place quite bare, without Tree or Graſs, becauſe the Earth is Bituminous, out of which the Indians draw a liquor, good to cure very many Diſeaſes. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their drawing of the ſaid liquor is thus. They cut the Earth into Turſs, which they lay in order upon poles or thick Reeds in a Sunny place, having veſſels under them to receive the Liquor. For by the Heat of the Sun this Bitumen Melts, or the Juyce included in the Earth diſſolves and ſweats through. Afterward the Turfs remain Dry, and Robd of their Oyly Liquor, and ſo become ſit for Fuel. But the Fire made of them is hurtful, by Reaſon of the thick blackneſs of the Smoak, and the ſtinking ſmel it makes. Yet for want of other Fuel they uſe the foreſaid turfs. The Liquor which fals from them is good for many Diſeaſes, eſpecially ſuch as proceed from cold. For it Mitigates pains, and diſcuſſes cold ſwellings. Wounds are cured therewith, and other Diſeaſes for which <hi>Caranna</hi> and <hi>Tacama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baca</hi> are good. Its color is dark Red inclining to black, and its ſmel is ſtrong. In <hi>Saxony, Miſnia, Low-Germany, Scotland,</hi> and other places, Bituminous and Fat Turfs are found: the Germans cal them <hi>Motten.</hi>

                  <p>And ſome hath in it more Bitumen, and ſome more of the Stone making Juyce: and therefore ſome of it will eaſily burne, but ſome wil not burn, unleſs it be mixed with other Coals and blown with bellows.</p>
                  <p>But he that would know more concerning Bitumens, let him read the Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries upon <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> eſpecially that rare third part of <hi>Andraeas Labavius,</hi> wherein largely and learnedly he explains the Hiſtory and Nature of all ſorts of Bitumen.</p>

                  <p> In the next Place comes Sulphur, or Brimſtone, which the Greeks call <hi>Theion;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Brim-ſtone</note> it is a Mineral Juyce, conſiſting of one part which is inflamable and ſends forth a grievous ſmel, and of another part which is Earthy, thick, and fixed, having a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triolated Juyce mingled therewith. It is reputed the Agent and Father in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Metals, and Coagulates the Mercury, if there be conjoyned a Metalline Spirit, and a Seminary Principle. Of which if it be deſtitute it deſtroies Metals, and conſumes ſuch things as are volatile. Now it is twofold, Native or Quick, <hi>Apuron,</hi> which hath not felt the Fire. For it is engendred pure ſolid and in clods, ſo that there needs no Fire to ſeparate its Impurities. The Ancients de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ribe it to be tranſparent. And now adaies there is hardly any ſuch found; but it is of an Aſhy color, and when it is broken. Yellowiſh within. Factitious or Artificial Brim-ſtone ſtone is boyled out of the Sulphurous mine which is digged out of the Ground. Now there is ſome difference in the Artificial, eſpecially in regard of Purity and colour depending thereupon, and ſome is yellowiſh, other ſome paler, and ſome encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to an Aſh-color.</p>
                  <p>Of Sulphur and Quick-ſilver is made <hi>Cinabrium Factitium,</hi> Artificial Sinoper. Of the Smoak of inflamed Sulphur received in a Glaſs Bell is made a ſharpe Liquor, like Spirit of Vitriol. And flower of Brim-ſtone is the purer part thereof, being ſublimated with Salt and Calcined Vitriol.</p>
                  <p>Now Brim-ſtone is of a digeſting, diſcuſſing and drawing faculty,
<note place="margin">The Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of Brim-ſtone</note> it is good for ſuch as breath ſhort and have an <hi>Empyema,</hi> taken in an Egg. Externally applied with Butter and Hogs-Greece, it Cures the Itch; and with Turpentine it heals the Tetter.</p>
                  <p>Neighbor to Brim-ſtone is Arſenick, Orpment, and Sandarach,
<note place="margin">Arſenick, Orpment and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darach.</note> which ſeem to agree in Nature and Faculties, and only to differ, becauſe the one is more the other leſs digeſted in the Bowels of the Earth; or that one hath more or leſs Quick-ſilver and Salt mingled with the Sulphur. Some take Arſenick for the kind, and call Orpment Saffron-colour'd Arſenick; Sandarach, red Arſenick; Riſagal, white Arſenick. But that which they cal white Arſenick, is now adaies known by the Name of Arſenick abſolutely: <hi>viz.</hi> Orpment ſo often ſublimed with Salt til it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come white, and Tranſparent like Chryſtal: the ſtrongeſt of all Eating and Fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Putrifying Poyſons. Now Orpment is a Sulphureous Mineral Juyce, having joyned therewith a little Quick-Silver, and the Spirit of Salt. Al the kinds are cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick and corroſive, and Enemies of the inward parts, which they fret, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the radical moiſture. Yea, it is not ſafe to apply Arſenick externally by Reaſon of its extream Venemous and Corroſive Nature. But if it be Calcined with Nitre, its volatile mercury and inflamable Sulphur are taken away, and a certain buttery Fatneſs remains, which is uſed externally for Fiſtula's and Ulcers hard to cure.</p>
                  <p>Hither alſo we muſt refer Antimony, <hi>Stimmi</hi> or <hi>Stibium,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Antimony.</note> which although it ſeems to come nearer the Nature of Metals, yet is it a Mineral Body, reſembling Lead, but brittle, conſiſting of Sulphur, crude Arſenick and much Quick-ſilver of an Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Nature, but all of them volatile. And therefore it yields a ſtinking and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Fume, which for the moſt part is Mercurial, but in ſome part Sulphureous and Arſenecal. Being crude applied externally it imitates the Virtues of Lead, and is binding, hinders the growing of fleſh, takes away the filth of the Eyes, and cures Ulcers. It makes great work for the Chymiſts, who make thereof ſundry purging and ſweating Medicaments; of which they have written whole Books, wherewith you may conſult.</p>
                  <p>Finally, Betwixt Antimony and Lead is <hi>Biſmuthum,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Biſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thum.</note> which is therefore called Aſh-colour'd Lead; being a Mineral Body whitiſh and Livid, Hard, Brittle, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of Earthy and crude Mercury, Sulphur and Arſenick, and all of them impure and Volatile.</p>
                  <p>And that we may conclude this ſubject, thoſe various kinds of Earths and Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, which we have muſtered hitherto, (and if there be any other to be reckoned,) they have their original from the Roots of Minerals. For in theſe alſo there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen ſundry corruptions. For although Gold and other Metals now perfectly dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted do not putrifie, and ſeem incorruptible; yet in their firſt Original they may be corrupted. So <hi>Terra Sigillata,</hi> of which we ſpake before, is thought to be nothing elſe but the firſt matter of Gold, Silver, or ſome other Metal (for there are ſundry kinds
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:35070:80"/>thereof) corrupted, <hi>viz.</hi> When the principles of Metals do not remain united, but the Sulphur and Mercury are Separated and Sublimated, and either transferred into ſome other place, or diſperſed into the Air. So Antimony ſeems to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but crude or raw Gold, corrupted before it was ripe; and <hi>Biſmuthum,</hi> immature Silver corrupted.</p>

                  <p>THe hardeſt of Minerals are Stones. And ſince that under this kind are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended both common Stones and Precious Stones or Jewels, we muſt firſt ſpeak ſomthing in General of the Generation of Stones.

                        </gap>tion of</note> It is commonly held, that by the concourſe and mixture of Elements, the firſt and Second qualities Co-opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Stones and precious Stones are produced. And though it is not to be denied, but that the Elements do concur unto their Conſtitution: yet the Elements alone do not ſuffice, and are only the remote cauſe of Stones and Jewels. Be the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments mixed how they can, yet the Primary agent being abſent, no precious Stone is made of them.</p>
                  <p>They who would produce a nearer Cauſe, have made exhalations the matter of Stones: but that alſo is too remote, nor wil it ſuffice alone, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>leſs it be more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially determined. <hi>Avicenna</hi> therefore and <hi>Albertus Magnus,</hi> that they might come more near to the buſineſs, have held the matter of Stones to be Clay and Juyce, <hi>viz.</hi> A clammy roaping Clay, to the mixture whereof more Earth hath concurd then Water: and a juyce that been hath ſuckt in, and raked off from the Earth, or that hath a Tincture of ſome M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tal. This opinion others follow, and hold that Stones are made of Clay of Earth glewed together with a clammy moiſture, ſuch as are dark; and with a Tranſparent Liquor ſuch as are clear and Tranſparent.</p>
                  <p>Yet in truth, not only Water and Earth, but all the Elements are in Stones, eſpecially precious ones. Yea, and the Chymiſts think the Elements are not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, but that as Metals ſo Stones and Jewels they ſay are made of thoſe three principles, Mercury, Sulphur and Salt. Of which opinion I ſhall ſpeak elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
                  <p>This only we ſhal hint in this place; that the matter of Metals, Stones and Jewels, is very near of kin, which not only the place where they grow but many other things do witneſs. For examples ſake, let us take Pome Garnets, out of which and Iron Tinctures are drawn ſo like, that it is not eaſie to diſcerne one of them from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and a more baſe ſort which are found in <hi>Sileſta</hi> and <hi>Miſnia</hi> do reſemble from alſo in color. Alſo many Stones, if they are burnt, do ſend forth Sulphureous fumes, juſt as Minerals and Metals do; and of Metals Glaſſes are made which do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much reſemble ſome precious Stones. And therefore Jewels and Metals ſeem not unſicly to be reduced to common principles: and it ſeems poſſible to reduce Jewels to ſome certain Metals.</p>
                  <p>Authors do ſtick yet more in Explaining the Efficient Cauſe of Stones:
<note place="margin">The effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Cauſe.</note> and the moſt have recourſe herein to Heat and Cold, and ſavour nothing beyond the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary qualities. And among Stones, thoſe which they count to be made of Clay, they think are coagulated by being baked together by Heat and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>yeeſs: and ſuch as they conceive to conſiſt of a watry matter, they hold to be Coagulat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>d and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by vehement cold, as Cryſtal. But many ſuch dark Stones are generated <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> the midſt of Waters and ſprings whoſe Coagulation cannot be made by the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of heat and dryneſs. And they are truly too ſimple, who think that Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtals, Adamants and ſuch like Stones, are frozen together by the Cold; ſince they are generated in the hotteſt Countries on the Surface of the Earth, both Adamants and other tranſparent Jewels; nor will they melt with Fire.</p>
                  <p>The Chymiſts hold Salt to be the Cauſe of Concretion and Coagulation:
<note place="margin">The true Cauſe of Concretion and Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation. A double Concretion</note> againſt which opinion of theirs although ſome ſiercely diſpute, yet is it not abſolutely to be rejected; ſeeing many evident Documents do prove the ſame; and ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ain it is, that many things are Coagulated and grow together in moiſt ſubjects, where neither dryneſs, Heat, nor cold have place. Yet, ſeeing there are two ſorts of Concreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which happen without adding or taking away any part of the matter: they
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:35070:80"/>are in no wiſe to be confounded, and we muſt ſpeak diſtinctly of the diſtinct man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Coagulation.</p>
                  <p>The former manner of Concretion is ſeen in Salts, as in common Salt, Vitriol, Nitre,
<note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of Salt:</note> Alum, Urin, and in the Salts made out of Plants and Animals may be ſeen; and it is proper to Salts, which naturally tend to ſuch a Coagulation, and indeed under a certain Figure; as the ſaid diverſity is to be ſeen in Nitre, Vitriol, Alum and other things.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe Salts have not hardneſs of themſelves,
<note place="margin">The cauſe of ſolidity and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</note> but are eaſily broken and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve in moiſture, but Jewels and Stones do not only grow together, but they are ſolid and hard, and do not melt in moiſture: this kind of Concretion or growing together is different from the former. The cauſe of which concretion ſome do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo refer to Salt, and the hardneſs to the admixture of Earth therewith: But others again (&amp; that probably enough) do hold that this Stoney hard concretion or grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together of Bodies doth proceed from a Stone making ſpirit or Juyce, which Stone making ſpirit and Juyce is every where found in the Earth and in the water, but not without Salt.</p>
                  <p>And thus the immediate cauſe of Stones and Jewels is agreed to be a Stone making Juyce, that is to ſay,
<note place="margin">The Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Cauſe of ſtones and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Stones</note> a matter of its own Nature tending to ſuch an hardneſs and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity. Now that ſeveral Stones and Jewels are generated, proceeds from the eſpecial form of each. For every precious Stone hath its proper and ſpecifick form whereby it is differenced from al other, which it obtains from, (as I may ſay) its Seminal prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Generation. Which doth not proceed from the Mixture of the Elements, but, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> rightly Names it, it is a ſift eſſence, put into this ſort of Natural things by almighty God, at the firſt Creation of the world. Which ſeminal prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and <hi>Architectonick</hi> Spirit, although it doth not appear in a Body peculiarly diſtinct, as in moſt plants, nor can its Eſſence be ſufficiently explained, yet muſt it not be therefore denied. For as the Willow, though it produce no Seed as other Plants do, yet it hath a Seminal principle diſperſed through the whole tree, and ſo is propagated by a bough cut off and ſtuck in the ground: ſo the Seminal principle of Jewels and Stones lies concealed in the Stone making matter; and in this dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Minds its eſſence is unknown to us, as al other forms are; and their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is not known ſave by the diverſity of their faculties, operations and Qualities. For upon this diverſity of Forms, fit matter being Joyned thereto, depends the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of colours and external ſhapes.</p>
                  <p>Hence the Cryſtal and <hi>Adamant</hi> of <hi>Hungaria</hi> and <hi>Sileſia</hi> have an Hexagonal or Six-corner'd ſhape; the Occidental Smaragds are four Square; the Bohemian Gna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and the Stone <hi>Geodes</hi> have a Globous Figure; and other precious Stones have other ſhapes.</p>
                  <p>Now I conceive the Colours of precious Stones may chiefly be drawn from the Sulphur of Metals. For, Carbuncles, Rubies and Granats,
<note place="margin">Whence the Colour of precious ſtones is:</note> do participate in their Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture with Gold and Iron: The Turkois hath the Tincture of Copper. And there may by Spirit of Salt, Urine, and other liquors, Tinctures be drawn out of Metals, which do perfectly reſemble the Colours of certain precious Stones. And from the ſame cauſes, <hi>viz.</hi> The forms and Mineral principles, other qualities alſo of Stones and Jewels, as hardneſs and weight. &amp;c. As alſo their Virtues and properties do flow.</p>
                  <p>As to their Native place, Stones are found every where; precious Stones,
<note place="margin">The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural place of precious Stones:</note> as in many other Countries, ſo in <hi>Miſnia, Sileſia, Bohemia,</hi> and other places of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi> But the more noble precious Stones are chiefly found in the <hi>Indies.</hi> The cauſe whereof is diverſly by divers aſſigned; and the moſt refer the ſame to the poſture of the Sun and Stars over the Zenith. Yet ſince in <hi>Africa, America,</hi> and other Regions which are under the ſame climate, there is no ſuch ſtore nor ſuch excellent precious Stones found: the cauſe is rather to be attributed to the Nature and diſpoſition of the Soil, and the Seminal principle implanted therein at the Creation.</p>
                  <p>Now Stones are ſome vulgar, others precious,
<note place="margin">The differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſtones:</note> according to the Purity or Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the matter whereof they conſiſt, and the nobility of the Form. For vulgar Stones conſiſt of a groſs and impure matter, and have a more Ignoble Form: and therefore their effects are leſs excellent. But precious Stones conſiſt of a more pure and Subtile matter, and have a more noble form. For the Chalk-ſtone, and other
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:35070:81"/>common Stones have alſo their ſulphur, which is ſufficiently diſcovered when they are burnt; but much thicker and impurer then the Granate or Amethyſt.</p>
                  <p>Now Stones are ſome Spungy,
<note place="margin">Ground Unicorne</note> others Solid. Amongſt thoſe kinds of Stones that is juſtly in the firſt place to be explained which is vulgarly taken for Unicorns Horne; and ſome cal it ground Ivory, others ground Horn. For in <hi>Thuringia,</hi> as alſo in <hi>Bohemia</hi> and other places, ſuch Horns are found; yea, and not only horns but other bones alſo; which are ſaid to be good to Sodder wounds and to heal Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.
<note place="margin">Its <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</note> But eſpecially, experience hath taught that theſe Stones have no ſmal uſe in the Falling-ſickneſs, Malignant Feavers, the Peſtilence, gripings of the Belly in Infants, and the Cure of other Diſeaſes; and therefore they are commonly given out for Unicorns Horns.
<note place="margin">How it may be known from true <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorns Horne:</note> Howbeit they may eaſily be diſcerned from the true Unicorns Horn. For the true Unicorns Horn is hard and ſolid, that it can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be raſped, much leſs can it be beaten to pouder: nor doth it much cleave to the Tongue; But this Stone is not hard, but as it were calcined, it is eaſily broken and rub'd to pouder, and being put to the Tongue it ſticks faſt, like <hi>Terra Sigillata</hi> or Bole-Armeniack.</p>
                  <p>Touching the Generation thereof, Men are of ſeveral opinions. Some conceive they are the bones of an Unicorn overwhelmed in the Earth by a flood, or ſome other occaſion, which remain after the fleſh and ſofter parts have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by Time. But this opinion is not agreeable to reaſon. For how ſhould there be ſo great a number of Unicorns, in <hi>Thuringia,</hi> the Hercinian Foreſt, near <hi>Elbingroda,</hi> alſo about <hi>Heidelberge, Hildeſheme,</hi> in <hi>Miſnia, Sileſia, Moravia,</hi> and in many other places? And why are theſe horns found in thoſe places rather then elſewhere, where it is more likely that there are Unicorns? Moreover ſtones are found, which repreſent the Bones not of this Creature only, but of others alſo.</p>
                  <p>More probable therefore it is,
<note place="margin">Its imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</note> that theſe are Mineral Stones. But what is their immediate matter is not eaſie to tell. Some hold that it is Bitumen or corrupted Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar; others, as <hi>Anſelmus Boetius, Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 242. that it is <hi>Marga,</hi> or a kind of Marle; others that it is ſome putrified and rotten Stone. This is certain, that it is a mineral matter, not unlike ſome <hi>Terra Sigillata,</hi> or a Mineral Juyce mingled with ſome ſuch Earth, and ſhaped into the Form of an Horn, Tooth, or other bone.</p>
                  <p>Nor let that ſame external form ſtumble any man. For though no man can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily tel the Cauſe of its Conformation, though many have labored to do it; yet certain it is, that many wonderful things are ſhaped in the Earth. Not to ſpeak of other things at this time, 'tis ſufficiently known, how many ſundry ſhapes are ſeen in Stones digged up at <hi>Iſlebia</hi> and elſewhere. For there are ſeen in thoſe Stones ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry ſhapes of Animals and Plants; of a Frog, as <hi>Salamander,</hi> a Serpent, a Viper, an Eel, a Carp, a <hi>Gilthead,</hi> a Gudgeon; Yea, and the Pictures of Princes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Men. And what ſhould be the cauſe of theſe Pictures 'tis hard for any man to tel.</p>
                  <p>As to the Virtues of theſe Stones, 'tis certain they are very good againſt the Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-ſickneſs, and Malignant Diſeaſes, and therefore they are many times uſed no leſs ſuccesfully then the Horn which is counted to be the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corns.</p>
                  <p>Now vulgar Stones are either Porous or Solid.
<note place="margin">Spungy ſtones:</note> The Porous or Spungy Stones, are the <hi>Tophus</hi> or crumbling gritty Stone, the <hi>Pumice,</hi> the <hi>Oſſifragus,</hi> the <hi>Oſteocolla, Stalactites,</hi> and moſt of thoſe Stones which are bred in living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                  <p>The ſolid Stones are many,
<note place="margin">Solid ſtones:</note> the Sand-ſtone, the Chalk-ſtone, the Flint, the Fire-ſtone, the Whet-ſtone, the Touch-ſtone, the Smiris wherewith they cut Glaſs. Sundry kinds of Marble, Alabaſter, Serpent-ſtone, Porphyry-Stone, Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, <hi>Ceraunias</hi> or Thunder-ſtone, the <hi>Belemnites,</hi> ſo called; and very many more.</p>
                  <p>Alſo there are other Stones of a middle Nature betwixt thoſe common groſs Stones and the Noble precious Stones: I ſhall only ſpeak a little of one or two of them.</p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:35070:81"/>
                  <p> The Load-ſtone in the firſt place, is a ſtone ſufficiently known;
<note place="margin">The Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone and its won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</note> and its effects are wholly wonderful, the cauſe whereof many learned men have hitherto labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to render. Now the effects of the Load-ſtone are either of the Stone alone, or of Iron toucht with the Stone; or of both the Stone and Iron. The ſimple ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the Stone are, to draw Iron to it, and to turn towards the Poles of the world. That it drew Iron was a thing not unknown to moſt of the Ancients: but its faculty of turning to the Poles of the world, as it is at this day very well known, ſo was it not known to the Ancients; nor hath any man been able as yet to make it appear, that it was known to <hi>Ariſtotle, Dioſcorides, Theophraſtus, Lucretius, Pliny,</hi> or any of the Ancients: but this Virtue was firſt diſcovered ſome few Ages ſince; although it is uncertain who was the Author or Inventor.</p>
                  <p>But what is the Cauſe of this motion, and whether it ſhould be ſought in Heaven or in Earth, is very obſcure. But that we may ſearch it out as much as is poſſible, we muſt preſuppoſe this in the firſt place, that the Load-ſtone in many places doth not turn exactly to the Poles of the world but towards them, declining a little from them, in ſome places more, in others Ieſs. Which declination from the Poles of the world is altogether of great uſe and moment. For whereas the Ancients at Sea knew only in the day time by the Sun in what Meridian of the world they ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; and in the night they knew by the Stars the Elevation of the Pole, and in what Latitude of the World they were: now by the help of the Load-ſtone they can find in what Longitude they are: and ſeeing it is confeſſed by all the Ancient Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, that nothing is more difficult in al Geography then to find out the Longitude of places, for which cauſe they do ſo much vary in aſſigning the Longitude of the moſt Famous Cities: by help of the Load-ſtone alone the Longitude of every place may moſt eaſily and exactly be found out. The Ancients indeed reckon'd their degrees of Longitude from the fortunate Iſles, and there they made the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and end of the Globe of the Earth. But the late Coſmographers obſerving that the Pole of the Load-ſtone and the Pole of the world did conſiſt in one Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, in the tenth degree beyond the fortunate Iſles Weſt-ward, about the <hi>Azores</hi> or Flandrick Iſlands; they make the beginning of Longitude there, not only to pleaſe themſelves but moved thereto by this Natural reaſon, Namely becauſe in that Meridian the Poles of the Load-ſtone and the Poles of the world do agree together. Now from that Beginning and Meridian, towards the Eaſt, the Declination en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes more and more, and it is greater or leſſer, according as the place is nearer to, or further from this firſt Meridian. In <hi>Germany,</hi> eſpecially about <hi>Norinberge,</hi> the Declination is ten degrees; here at <hi>Wittenberge</hi> about nine. The Hollanders who have ſailed into <hi>Norwey</hi> and the neighbouring places towards the Eaſt, have found the declination of the Load-ſtone from the Meridian to be ſixteen degrees; and at <hi>Nova Zembla</hi> ſeventeen degrees in the more Eaſterly parts, provided they made their obſervations with exact Inſtruments. And it is probably aſſerted, that if the Hollanders ſhould finiſh their Navigation towards the Eaſt, the more Eaſterly they went and the nearer to <hi>China,</hi> they ſhould find the declination of the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone from the Meridian ſo much the more abated, and they ſhould at laſt come to that place towards the Eaſt, in which the Poles of the Load-ſtone and the world would be in one Meridian, and that there would be no deflection of the Pole of the Load-ſtone in the hundred and eighty degree of Longitude, oppoſite to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Longitude in the Weſt.</p>
                  <p>Yet there is a certain learned Man who holds that the Hollanders are deceived in this point. For when they lookt upon their compaſſes they did not conſider that the Compaſſes were ſo made, that the Iron toucht by the Load-ſtone was not pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced juſt under the Flower-de-luce painted upon the card, but was diſtant therefrom certain degrees. And therefore whiles the Hollanders lookt upon the Flower-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luce, and ſaw that it pointed directly towards the North, they conceited that there was no Magnetical declination in that place; whereas the Iron toucht with the Load-ſtone was ſome degrees diſtant from the Flower-de luce or the true North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point. And therefore he placed the firſt Meridian, with the Ancients, in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate or <hi>Canary</hi> Iſlands, becauſe in that place there was no declination of the Load-ſtone at all. In which point experience muſt be judg. Yet it ſeems to me improbable, that the Hollanders who knew very wel how to make their compaſſes, ſhould be ſo heedleſs in ſuch a Caſe.</p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:35070:82"/>
                  <p> But be it how it wil be, this is certain and confirmed by manyfold experience, that the Pole of the Load-ſtone is diſtant from the Poles of the world twenty three degrees or thereabouts.</p>
                  <p>And hence ſome do probably collect, that the declination of the Poles of the Load-ſtone from the Poles of the world, and the declination of the Poles of the world from the Poles of the Zodiack, is one and the ſame; and ſince the utmoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the Planets is twenty three degrees and ſome minutes, that doubtleſs therefore the declination of the Poles of the Load-ſtone from the Poles of the world is the ſame.</p>
                  <p>But doubtful it is whether the Cauſe of this motion of the Load-ſtone towards the Pole is in the Heaven or in the Earth,
<note place="margin">The Cauſe of the Loadſtoaes turning to the Pole.</note> and where in the Heaven, or in the Earth. Some are indeed of opinion that there are certain Mountains of Load-ſtone under the Pole, to which the Load-ſtone moves by ſimilitude of Nature. But they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not wel tel what or how great thoſe Mountains are; nor are mines of Load-ſtone wanting in other parts of the world, but they are found in many Regions, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Others ſay the Load-ſtone turnes to the Pole-Star, others that it turnes to ſome Stars about the Pole-Star. But the Load-Stone doth not look directly to the Pole; ſave in ſuch places where the Meridian goes through the Pole of the World and the Pole of the Load-ſtone both at once: in al other places it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, that which is ſaid of the converſion of the Load-ſtone to the North pole, is now adaies called in queſtion by learned Men. And ſome do make two oppoſite points in the Load-ſtone, whereof one turnes to the North, the other to the South, if the Stone hang moveable and free. Which though others do not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny; yet they ſay that point is ſtronger which turns to the South then that which turns to the North, and ſo they hold that the Load-Stone turns rather to the South then to the North. And though there were nothing in the Load-Stone which did Naturally turn to the North; yet its turning to the South is ſufficient to ſhew the North-Pole. For ſince the South-Pole is juſt oppoſite to the North, if one part of the Load-Stone or of the card touched with the Load-ſtone turne to the South, the other end muſt of neceſſity point to the North. Of which this is a remarkable token, that thoſe who make compaſſes and Sun-Dials with magnetick Needles, do rub the Load-ſtone upon that end which ſtands to the South, and not upon the Croſſend which Looks to the North; and therefore the Magnetick Needle turns primarily to the South, and the oppoſite part points to and ſhews the North.</p>
                  <p>Hence therefore ſome have come to be of opinion, that the Load-ſtone is turned towards the South; becauſe all the Planets have their Efficacy and Operation in the South. Since they move from the Eaſt, through the South, towards the Weſt. Yet in very deed, although it go ſo in our Regions: yet there are oppoſite places, wherein the Ecliptick declines from the Aequator towards the North, and the Planers perform their courſes, from the Eaſt, through the North, towards the Weſt. Moreover the Planets do not abide in the ſame place, but one in one place, another in another; moreover they do not ſtick faſt, but paſs over the whole Heaven every day. If therefore the Load-ſtone ſhould look towards the Planets, it could not look towards one place, ſince there are divers Planets; nor would it ſtand ſtill, but ſhould be alwaies moved, following the motion of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets.</p>
                  <p>The opinion of others is more probable who hold, that as other things tend to their own proper place: ſo the Load-ſtone unleſs it be hindred doth alſo defire alwaies the ſame Scituation which it had in its Native place. Wherein neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we muſt conſult with experience, and enquire how the Load-ſtone is Scituate in the Mines.</p>
                  <p>But that Opinion is moſt probable, that the Load-ſtone is moved towards its own Pole in the Earth, which is diſtant about twenty three degrees from that point which anſwers to the Pole of the World: and that either the South only, or if the Load-ſtone have two Poles, and one part thereof turns to the North, another to the South (concerning which we muſt again conſult with experience) yet that it chiefly tends to the South: and that it hath ſome affinity with its own place, or with the things that are there; and that doubtleſs the point to which the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:35070:82"/>moves muſt be held to be rather in Earth then in Heaven. For that ſame point is fixed; but the Pole of the Zodiack, or any other Star thereabouts to which the Load-ſtone ſhould be moved, doth it ſelf move and finiſhes its round in the ſpace of twenty four hours; whereas the Load-ſtone doth perpetually turn to one point. Nor can it be perceived that the Load-ſtone, or the ſmalleſt Iron Wires toucht with the Load-ſtone do ever move upwards towards Heaven. Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, good Authors relate that the Load-ſtone tends towards the Earth, which may be proved, they ſay, by theſe experiments. If you place a Needle in <hi>Aequilibrio</hi> ſo ſo that both ends are equally diſtant from the Earth, and then touch one end with a Load-ſtone; they ſay that end will bow towards the Earth more then the other. Alſo if you weigh pieces of Iron Wire, and after they are toucht with a Load-ſtone put them in the Scales again, you ſhall find that they weigh more then they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were touched, becauſe they encline towards the Earth. And therefore, ſince two Poles of the Load-ſtone are to be conſtituted in the Earth, one diſtant about twenty three degrees from the point juſt under the North-Pole of the world, towards the place now called the ſtraits of <hi>Anian,</hi> the other in the South part op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polite, Scituate in the Meridian which paſſes through the <hi>Azores</hi> or Flandrick Iſlands, <hi>Caput Viride</hi> and <hi>Caput Corvo,</hi> or (as others will have at) which paſſes through the <hi>Canary</hi> Iſlands: in all places under this Meridian there is no declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Load-ſtone, but the Needle touched by the Load-ſtone falls exactly with the Meridian; in all other places of the whole Earth the ſaid Needle declines from the Meridian of the place, ſomtimes more, ſomtimes leſs, ſomtimes towards the Eaſt, otherwhile towards the Weſt; whereof ſee the obſervations of the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers, and the Mathematical Memorials of <hi>Simon Stevinus,</hi> in the 5 Book of his <hi>Geography.</hi> But what that is to which the Load ſtone is moved, is hard for any man to tel: let that ſuffice us, which <hi>Scaliger</hi> writes in his 131. <hi>Exercitation,</hi> where there are alſo other things concerning the Load ſtone, worthy to be read: <hi>Nature</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>being linkt in a league of Amity to it ſelf, hath allied all things as well thoſe above as theſe here below in a perpetual band of friendſhip, which makes all this world to be one thing admirably diſpoſed; ſo that there are not only certain degrees as it were of approach and diſtance in things ſeparated: but alſo the Commixtures of thoſe ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which are quite parted one from another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now concerning the Virtue of drawing Iron (for I do not here diſpute,
<note place="margin">Why the Load ſtone draws Iron</note> as <hi>Scaliger</hi> hath it in <hi>Exercit.</hi> 102. <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. whether the Load-ſtone draws Iron, or Iron the Load-ſtone; for which ſo ever it is, the Cauſe is one and the ſame) the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie is no leſs. <hi>Epicurus</hi> is ſaid to have held, that from the Iron and Load-ſtone <hi>Atomes</hi> do flow, which agreeing in Figure do imbrace one another, and ſtrike againſt the Bodies of the Load ſtone and the Iron, from whence being reflected they draw the Iron. <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> held that the Load-Stone had a Soul and therewith drew the Iron. From whom <hi>Cardan</hi> differs not much, who alſo avers that the Magnet or Load ſtone doth live; whom <hi>Scaliger</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth <hi>Exercitat.</hi> 102. <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. <hi>Marſilius Ficinus</hi> in <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Vit. Coelit. Compar. Cap.</hi> 15. fetches the Cauſe hereof from the Conſtellation of the Bear, to which both the Load-ſtone and Iron are ſubject, and both do orderly follow the Bear; but the Load-ſtone holds the upper degree in the propriety of the Bear, and Iron the lower; and that ſo the Load-ſtone as being in the upper order draws the Iron, which he reckons to be in the lower.</p>
                  <p>But in good earneſt, if we ſhal diligently weigh the matter, we ſhal hardly find any thing more probable then that ſame mutual conſent of things Natural. For therein well-near al learned men that have pondered the Nature of the Load-ſtone do conſent, that the Load-ſtone is a kind of Iron Mine, and that Iron may be made thereof.</p>
                  <p>And here is to be obſerved, that the whol body of that which we cal the Load-ſtone, is not indeed the Loadſtone, for the whole Stone doth not draw Iron; but that the ſubſtance of the Magnet is diſperſed in its ſtone like Veins; even as other Metals are ſeldom bred a lone and pure, but in their Matrixes or Wombs, and therfore the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hetick-ſtone draws the Iron only with that part, where is the Vein of the Load-ſtone.</p>
                  <p>From whence this alſo follows, that the Cauſe of Attraction is rather in the Load-ſtone then in the Iron. For the Iron is already a fixed metal: but the Load-ſtone is not yet fixed, and therefore it can more freely ſend forth its ſtrength and ſpirit.</p>

                     <hi>Andreas Libavius, Part.</hi> 3. <hi>Singul. Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. where he treates of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive Virtue of the Load-ſtone, endeavours to aſſign yet a more ſpecial Cauſe, and writes that the Nature of this principle in the Load-ſtone is Bituminous, which is reduced and directed to a ſingularity with the Iron, by ſimilitude of that conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy and mixture, whereby the ſame principles have grown together in Iron: and that an Iron and Bituminous ſpirit is common to them both, but that it doth not flow ſo ſtrongly nor ſo continually from the Iron as from the Load-ſtone, becauſe of the different Coagulation or Conſiſtency. Where we willingly grant that a certain Sulphur or Sulphurous ſpirit is common to the Load-ſtone and the Iron: which if <hi>Libavius</hi> pleaſe to cal Bitumen (for he counts Bitumen to be a thing more general then Sulphur, and that Sulphur hath its original from Bitumen) I will not contend with him about the Name; but that Bituminous or Sulphureous things only have a mutual Appetite one to another, I ſee not how he can prove. Nor doth hetel us, whether they mutually deſire one another, by Reaſon of their Sulphur, or of their whole eſſence. But whatever is the Cauſe of the affinity betwixt the Load-ſtone and the Iron, which cannot be denied; that general Rule there laid down by <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bavius</hi> holds true: one Nature covers another of the ſame ſort, and like will to like, as much as it can; eſpecially there where the Virtue ariſes and ſticks, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends another like it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>We muſt not in this place paſs over the armed Load-ſtone,
<note place="margin">The Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</note> whoſe force is much ſtronger then that of the unarmed. For a Load-ſtone unarmed will draw only a Pack-needle or a bit of Iron hardly weighing a dram or two: but if it be armed, it draws ſixteen ounces or more. The Art of arming them, is this. Seek out in a Lump of a Load-ſtone its Poles, which may be done with the help of a Needle in a Sun-Diall; the Poles being found, let the Load-ſtone be poliſhed, and reduced into ſuch a ſhape as it is capable of (howbeit the long ſquar is the moſt convenient ſhape) yet ſo that the Axis reaching from the one to the other Pole may lie in the middeſt betwixt two parallel lines, equally diſtant from each of them. The ſides be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then let two plates be framed of the beſt Steel, of which the one ſide which touches the Load-ſtone muſt be ſmooth and even, if the ſides where the Poles are be plain; or of what ſhape ſoever they be, they muſt be ſo fitted to the ſides of the Load-ſtone that no ſpace may be left betwixt the Steel and the Load-ſtone, but the other ſide muſt be a little round, and on the lower ſide the plates muſt hang a little beneath the Load-ſtone; and the parts that hang under muſt be ſomewhat thicker and ſquarer then the reſt like Pillars. The Plates being thus formed muſt be applied to the Poles on each ſide, and to keep them faſt they muſt be bound with two round hoops of Silver or braſs, which muſt go about the Load-ſtone above and beneath. Alſo let the upper ſide thereof be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a Plate of Silver or Braſs, with a Ring whereby to hang up the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone thus armed. When it is hung up apply unto the little Pillars of Steel which come beneath the Stone, a Plate of Steel as big as it can draw and there let it hang.</p>
                  <p>In the next place we muſt not forget Bezoar Stone,
<note place="margin">Bezoar Stone.</note> whereof Many things are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in the writings of Phyſitians; ſeeing it is both precious and rare, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commended againſt Poyſon.

                  </head>
                  <p>NOw concerning the generation of Metals the opinion of Authors is various.
<note place="margin">The Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoteleans opinion concerning the matter of Metals.</note> And as to the matter of Metals, the Ariſtoteleans do hold that as all other things digged out of the Earth are made of a Smoaky exhalation, ſo all metals do ſpring from a vaporous Exhalation, and that moiſture is prevalent in them, becauſe they may be Melted and Hammered. And they teach that Metals are generated, when a Subtertaneal Vapor included, eſpecially in Stones, in regard of a dry Exhalation which drew it upward, is gathered into one, and Coagulated like Dew into very ſmal drops, which cannot be done without cold: yet with this difference; that in the Generation of Dew and Hoar-froſt the foreſaid drineſs which carried the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por upwards is ſeparated: but in the generation of Metals that ſame ſeparation is not made, but the dry Exhalation is contained and Coagulated with the Vapor.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit, this opinion is not to be received unleſs it be otherwiſe explained. For it ſuppoſes a matter too remote, and ſpeakes of the generation of Metals, as if it ſpake of Meteors. And thoſe who hold thus concerning the Generation of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, ſeem to be of his mind, who intending to ſpeak of the Generation of Animals, ſhould make, not Blood and Seed, but an Exhalation Dry or Moiſt, the principle of Living-Creatures.</p>
                  <p>The Chymiſts therefore do better,
<note place="margin">The opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Chymiſes.</note> who having more diligently ſought into the Generation and Reſolution of Merals, hold their principles to be Sulphur and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury; to which later writers have, not without Cauſe, added Salt, or a Metalline, Copperaſated, or Vitriolated Earth: and that in all theſe a Formative and Semin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Faculty was at the Creation implanted by God the Creator; which as <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaies <hi>Bxercit.</hi> 307. <hi>Sect.</hi> 20. is a certain fift eſſence far different from the four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and which as the principal agent makes Metals of matter thereto diſpoſed. And therefore wherever this Senſinal Principle is wanting, no Metal can be made of any Exhalation, Dry or Moiſt, by the power of any efficient whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>And that the Matter-thus ſtands, is apparent from the Metal mines, the meltings, Probations, and reſolutions of Metals, and the very Proprieties of the Metals them-ſelves. For in all Mines theſe principles are found, and out of all the Oate where-in all Metals are Generated, Sulphur is boiled. Alſo 'tis very well known to Chymiſts, that Metals may be changed into running Quick-Silver, and that of Quick-Silver Metals may be made. Yea any man may judg by his Noſe and Eyes, that there is Sulphur in metals; becauſe in the Calcinations and melting down of Copper and Iron, a greeniſh and reddiſh flame is ſeen, and there is a ſmel of Brim-ſtone. And moſt Diſeaſes wherewith dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and refiners of Metals are troubled, have their original from Sulphur and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury. The Reſolution or Diſſolving of Metals ſhews the ſame, which is not into Dry and moiſt Exhalations only, but into things of kin to Metals, retaining their own Nature and properties, in ſundry alterations and external Mutations. For Lead being turned into Ceruſs, although it ſeem to have quite put off its Nature, yet may it be melted into Lead again. Yea and <hi>Stibium</hi> doth turn again to Antimony without much ado. The ſpecifical proprieties of Metals do argue the ſame, which witneſs; that they have not their original only from the mixture of Elements. For that which is true of the Load-ſtone, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> writes, that it cannot by any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the Elements draw Iron: the ſame may be ſaid of many proprieties and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of Metals.</p>
                  <p>And the Mercurial matter is the chiefeſt in the Conſtitution of Elements; which being ſundry waies mixed with fixt or volatile Sulphur, and a copperaſated Salt or Earth, makes ſundry ſorts of Metals. And the Chymiſts do commonly call Mercury the Mother and Feminine Principle, and Sulphur the Father and Maſculine princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Now wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h Sulphur is mingled Vitriol or Metallick Salt; and in Sulphur there is Vitriol, and in al Vitriol, Sulphur: whence it happens, that out of both there is a Spirit drawn much a like.</p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:35070:85"/>
                  <p> But that others do think otherwiſe in this point, the chief cauſe is; inaſmuch as theſe principles are not alwaies found in mines after the ſame likeneſs and form as they imagined. Moreover, becauſe metals are not found every where and in all places in which Quick-Silver and Sulphur are found. And Finally, became they cannot ſufficiently diſcerne theſe principles in Metals. For they think it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that in every Mine of Metal theſe principles ſhould be found with the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, but eſpecially that Metals ought alwaies to be found in the Veins of Mercury and Sulphur: and if Sulphur were in Metals they conceive it muſt needs flame.</p>
                  <p>But unleſs they were blinded with the darkneſs of Chymical Ignorance they might eaſily ſee thoſe principles in Metallick Veins. For they do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies appear under one and the ſame viſible form and ſhape; though ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are found in the mines, in the very ſame ſhape: but ſomtimes they wander in the ſhapes of Exhalations and Spirits, ſomtimes they are Coagulated into the form of a Juyce, an Earth, or ſome other form. Yea, and the Metals themſelves are found ſomtimes Fixed, other whiles Volatil. For Nature Generates Mercury after a Spiritual manner; to which if a Copperaſated Sulphur be added, and a formative principle, it is Coagulated into a Metal. But if Sulphur and the formative Principle be wanting, it grows together into a peculiar matter and is found alone. For one of theſe doth not ſuffice to make a Metal, but all of them are requiſite. And therefore in ſuch Mines, in which one is preſent and the reſt are wanting, Metals are not generated. But there alone Metals are bred, where a Sulphureous Vitriolated ſixative Spirit is exactly mixed with Quick-Silver in a matter fit to become a Metal. Thoſe Bodies do not make Metals, but the Spirit muſt of neceſſity be mingled moſt intimately. But in this formation, before they grow quire firm and Dry and come to Maturity, they are often found in the likneſs of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral juyce, and unripe Metal: and at laſt they are Coagulated and compacted into a perfect Metal.</p>
                  <p>And they that are ſtumbled at the inflameable Nature of Sulphur, muſt know, that there is no neceſſity that Metals muſt take flame becauſe they have Sulphur in them. Simple Water Wets, but it doth not ſo in compounds; Air aſcends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, but not in mixed Bodies. Again, they are ignorant that an inflamable and Volatile thing may ſo be fixed, that it ſhall take flame no more. For it is the property of all Sulphur to be inflamable, but not at all times: and the more it is fixed the leſs it conceives flame; and the more it is fixed, the leſs ſubject Metal is to burn. Hence it comes to paſs, that Iron and Copper are burned, and ſend forth a notable ſlame: but Gold by reaſon of the ſixedneſs of its Sulphur with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the violence of Fire.</p>
                  <p>From hence alſo,
<note place="margin">The effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe of Metals.</note> it is eaſie to judg of the Efficient cauſe and active principle in the Generation of Metals. For they who conceive that Metals are Coagulated only by cold do diſcover their own ſimplicity of wit, or their unskilfulneſs in the point of Metals: ſeeing Metals have already an internal Cauſe of their Coagulation, and are diſſolved by heat; cold only gives occaſion of their Coagulation. But if that internal Cauſe of Coagulation be wanting, no external cold is ſufficient to Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate the ſame. Which is to be ſeen in Quick-Silver, which no cold can congeal, and yet it is Coagulated with the Spirit of Lead. Yea, in the very Fire it ſelf, by Cementations and other Coctions, Coagulation and ſixation is made.</p>
                  <p>We ought therefore, touching the Nature and original of Metals, rather to credit the Diggers, Refiners, and Triars of Metals, and the Chymiſt, then idle diſputers, Ignorant of the Nature of Metals, Who, out of an hatred to Chymiſtry, do endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour (by I know not what Reaſon) to perſwade us otherwiſe. And therefore the moſt learned alſo of the Peripateticks, who have fearcht more deeply into the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Metals, do in this point follow the opinion of the Chymiſts.</p>
                  <p>Now the Common Affections of Metals are, to be melted with heat;
<note place="margin">The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncts of Metals.</note> to grow hard again by cold; to be hammered and beaten out, to drink in Quick Silver; to be diſſolved by <hi>Aqua-Fortis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They flow and melt by Reaſon of Quick-Silver: and therefore thoſe who have moſt part Quick-Silver are more eaſily Molten; but thoſe more hardly, in which Sulphureous dryneſs and Salt are moſt prevalent. And if there be good ſtore of
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:35070:86"/>Mercury in Metals they become ſo ſoft, as to be melted by the very leaſt heat; Contrariwiſe, ſuch as are often burnt in the Fire, their Mercurial moiſture being taken away, they become at laſt hardly Meltable; as alſo if they be ſteeped in Aluminous, Copperaſated, and fixatory Waters.</p>
                  <p>Alſo malleableneſs depends upon the Mercurial Humidity. And thoſe Metals may be beſt hammered and ſpred abroad by beating which have a Mercurial moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture moſt exactly mixed with a Sulphur proportionable. Contrariwiſe, thoſe in which there is moſt of a Vitriolated Sulphur, of Salt and Metalline Earth, they are leaſt Malleable.</p>
                  <p>Now Metals do drink in Quick-Silver, becauſe they have one Root, and their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are of kin; as we ſee Oyls eaſily mix'd with Oyly things, and Water with things Watry.</p>
                  <p>Metals are by others otherwiſe divided:
<note place="margin">Difference of Metals.</note> but they are by the Chymiſts uſually divided into Perfect and Imperfect. And they count that perfect which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat both in Subſtance and Accidents, and excellently fitted for uſe. Such an one (Namely) as hath a ſubtile Mercurial Subſtance, a moſt ponderous Nature; that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures the Fire and all the trials thereof, without even the very leaſt detriment; it is eaſily joyned with Mercury, and moſt eaſily and largly dilated. Al which marks, ſince they are moſt to be found in Gold, it is by the conſent of al Nations reputed the moſt excellent and perfect Metal. Whereof nevertheleſs you may read what <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randulanus</hi> ſaies, in his <hi>Book de Auro.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now a Queſtion is here raiſed,
<note place="margin">Whether Metals differ ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifically or not.</note> whether Metals differ ſpecifically, or not. Very many Chymiſts hold, that they do not ſpecifically differ, but only in degrees of perfection, and that they conſiſt all of the ſame matter; have the ſame efficient Cauſe; are generated in the ſame place: that in Lead there is alwaies ſome Gold found; in ſome Braſs there is Gold; and divers of them are commonly bred toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; they are mutually changed one into another, as Iron into Copper; out of all Vitriol is made, and all are reſolved into Mercury. Hence doubtleſs were theſe ſayings of the Chymiſts: <hi>Lead is Leprous Gold: the Inner parts of Silver are Gold.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet, If I may ſpeak mine own opinion, I c<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nceive that Metals are ſpecifically different. For though it may rightly be ſaid that al have one and the ſame matter, not only generical and remote, but alſo immediate (in which reſpect they differ from other Natural things, and for which cauſe it is that they are turned one into another, and divers generated at once in the ſame place) yet have they not the ſame Ultimate matter; but therein they differ. Yet neither are they differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced only by accidents, but by a ſubſtantial ſpecifick form, and there is one form of Gold, another of Iron, and another of Lead, which diſpoſes and Labours that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon matter according to its own Nature, which appears by the effects and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Hence it is, that though all of them are reſolved into vitriol and Mercury; yet that Vitriol which is made out of Copper differs not a little from that made out of Iron.</p>
                  <p>Nor is that of any moment which ſome Chymiſts ſay; that Nature alwaies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends that which is moſt perfect. For this is true in every kind. In the kind of Men, Nature intends to make the perfecteſt man; in the kind of a Vine, the moſt perfect Vine; in the kind of Gold, the moſt perfect Gold. Yet doth it not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follow that becauſe Gold is the perfecteſt Metal therefore Nature alwaies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to make Gold. For that is juſt as if a Man ſhould ſay, that Nature in the kind of Animals alwaies intended a Man, who is the moſt perfect of al Live-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And if Nature alwaies intended Gold, why is there no more to be found? Now they hold that there are two perfect Metals, Gold and Silver: and four im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect ones.</p>
                  <p>Gold is the moſt perfect of all Metals,
<note place="margin">Gold what it is?</note> conſiſting of the moſt pure Mercury, moſt perfectly digeſted and ripened, by Virtue of a moſt excellent and fixed ruddy Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, wherewith it is moſt exactly mixed and united. Hence it comes to have a yellow colour; it is moſt weighty of al Metals, it indures the Fire, it may be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten out exceedingly thin, and it is moſt eaſily of all Metals united to Mercury. The Chymiſts do call it <hi>Sol,</hi> the Sun.</p>
                  <p>Silver is a perfect Metal,
<note place="margin">Silver, What?</note> yet more inferior then Gold, conſiſting of a Mercury
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:35070:86"/>almoſt fixed, and of a white Sulphur, almoſt ſixed alſo. For it is neither ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy nor ſo fixed as Gold. And therefore although it endures the Fire after a ſort, and abides in the Aſhy Cement, yet doth it not endure in the Royal Cement, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, Sulphur. Next to Gold it is beaten to the greateſt thinneſs of any Metal. The Chymiſts call it <hi>Luna,</hi> the Moon.</p>
                  <p>Imperfect Metals are thoſe which have principles not ſo mature and wel digeſted, nor ſo fixed and pure: whence it happens, they can neither endure the thunder of Lead, nor the Cement, nor Sulphur, but flie away in ſmoak and ſparkles, or are changed into droſs, Glaſs, Stones.</p>
                  <p>Now they are hard or ſoft. The hard are thoſe which by Reaſon of their Earthy Sulphur and hardned Mercury are firſt red hot before they melt; the ſoft are thoſe which by Reaſon of a moiſter Mercury and leſs digeſted are firſt melted before they are Red Hot. The hard have more Sulphur then the ſoft; but it is Earthy and contains more vitriolated Juyce. And therefore they are eaſily turned into Vitriol. Hence it comes to paſs, that they ſuffer detriment by Fire, and will not endure the tryal of more perfect Metals, but Fly into the Air.</p>
                  <p>Now the hard Metals are two, Braſs or Copper, and Iron.
<note place="margin">Braſs o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And hence, by reaſon of its Sulphur, it is thought to have affinity with Gold, and to contain in it the principles and Seeds of Gold; and it is believed that by digeſtion it may attain to ſome maturity and perfection. Alſo it hath affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Silver; ſeeing in the Marchaſite and the <hi>Lapis Fiſſilis</hi> they are oftentimes found both together: and Silver and Copper being diſſolved are both of a blew colour. The Chymiſts cal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Iron is an imperfect Metal, conſiſting of a little Mercury and much fixed Sulphur,
<note place="margin">Iron.</note> being of a whitiſh black and Blew colour. Hence it comes to paſs, that it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſlow in melting and bears long the force of Fire; and is readily calcined. Alſo it is hardly Joyned with Mercury, becauſe there is little Mercury in it. Alſo it hath little Vitriol, and therefore it is of a whitiſh livid colour. The Chymiſts cal it <hi>Marr.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſoft Metals are, white Lead which is called Tinn; and Black-Lead which is called ſimply Lead.</p>
                  <p>Tinn or white Lead, is an imperfect Metal, ſoft and white,
<note place="margin">Tinn.</note> conſiſting of much Mercury, leſs pure and fixed then in the perſect Metals, but purer and more fixed then in Black-Lead, and of a white impure and unripe Sulphur. Being mixed with Gold and Lead it leaves them malleable; but being mingled with the other Metals it makes them break under the Hammer. The Chymiſts call it <hi>Jupiter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Black-Lead is an imperfect Meral, Soft, of a livid colour,

Hence, being uſed in the trial of perfected Metals it conſumes the imperfect, and carries them away with it ſelf in Smoak, or turns them into droſs. It is of all Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals the moſt eaſily melted. The Chymiſts cal it <hi>Saturn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Finally, Of kin to Merals is Quick-ſilver, a Mineral Liquor,
<note place="margin">Quick-Silver.</note> of a wonderful Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for it flows like Water, and yet it wets not. It is the weightieſt of all Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and wil ſuffer nothing to ſink into it but Gold. Now it conſiſts of a clammy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallick Water, and a Sulphureous Earth, exactly mingled; and it mingles with Metals, firſt with Gold, then with Tinn, then with Lead, then with Silver; hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with Copper and Iron. The Chymiſts call it Mercury; becauſe as Mercury aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates himſelf with all the Planets, ſo doth Quick-ſilver with all Metals; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe its Nature is moveable and ſhifting, which hath hitherto ſufficiently exerciſed many Chymiſts, and is not yet ſufficiently underſtood. And therefore hardly can we ſay any thing thereof in this brief diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>And here to conclude our Diſcourſe of Metals,
<note place="margin">Whether the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation of Metals be poſſible.</note> we muſt not paſs over that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie concerning the tranſmutation of Metals. Out of which briefly to unwind our ſelves, ſeeing, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> rightly judges, it is a certain weakneſs of mind to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:35070:87"/>ſeek for Reaſons and let go Senſe; I conceive the ſhallow Reaſons of ſome Perſons unskilful in Chymiſtry are no waies to be preferred before experience. Now it is a moſt known thing, that in <hi>Hungaria,</hi> at a Town called <hi>Smoinits,</hi> in the Mountain <hi>Carpathus,</hi> there is a Fountain, whereinto Iron being caſt is turned into very good Copper. The like is done at this day in <hi>Goſlaria.</hi> Nor is this performed by Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Waters only, but the ſame may be done by Art alſo. For if Iron be caſt into vitriolated Water there ſticks a red pouder thereto, which being melted in the Fire becomes Copper. So Quick-Silver is turned into Lead, with no great pains. Alſo it hath been often found true by experience, in this Age of ours, that other Metals may be turned into Gold: and it is Notoriouſly known, what that ſame <hi>Alexander Sidon,</hi> a Scotchman performedat <hi>Colenius Baſil,</hi> and others places. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which matter ſee the Hiſtoris of the Metallick Tranſmutation deſcribed by <hi>Ewaldus de Hoghelande;</hi> and the writings publiſhed by <hi>Andreas Libavius,</hi> for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Tranſmutatory Alchymy.</p>
                  <p>Since therefore by Experience it is ſufficiently manifeſt; we need not diſpute long of this Matter. One thing we ſhal briefly hint. That the Tranſmutation of Metals is not Simply and Barely Artificial, ſave as it applies things Natural to perform ſome certain action. Nor doth the Art proceed upon any but meerly Natural principles; and ſuch things as Nature hath generated ſhe doth only mix after a certain Faſhion.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince Method requires that we ſhould now treat of Living and Animal Things; we muſt firſt ſpeak of the Soul.
<note place="margin">Whether there be a Soul or no?</note> That there is ſuch a thing as a Soul, is manifeſt by the operations thereof. For we ſee that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving things perform many operations which they cannot do when they are dead. It follows therefore that the Body it ſelf cannot be the cauſe of thoſe operations; but that there is ſomwhat in the Body which perſorms the ſame. Now ſince every operation is a kind of tranſient accident, never firmly ſubſiſting in it ſelf; there muſt needs be in the Body ſome cauſe, which is the ſtable and conſtant producer of actions; which being preſent, life and every action is performed, and when it departs, the life ceaſeth: and this cauſe of ſuch like actions is termed <hi>Anima,</hi> the Soul.</p>
                  <p>As to what concerns the Eſſence of the Soul, I omit the ſundry Opinions of the Ancients, which are reckoned up, and largely refuted by <hi>Ariſtotle, Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Anima.</hi> Marſilius Ficinus, <hi>Lib.</hi> 6.7.8. <hi>Theologiae Platonicae.</hi> And I ſhal retain the Definition of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in 2. <hi>de Anima, c.</hi> 1. <hi>text.</hi> 6. which is this,
<note place="margin">The Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of the Soul. The Soul is neither an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, nor a body.</note> 
                     <hi>A Soul is the firſt act and perfection of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Body, which bath an aptitude to Life;</hi> or briefly, <hi>of a Natural Body, whoſe parts are Organs.</hi> For the Soul is neither an accident, (ſeeing an accident cannot be one part of a compounded ſubſtance, ſuch as a living Body is, nor the firſt principle of all actions, or make a true difference betwixt two ſubſtances;) nor a Body, for two Bodies cannot be in one place: But it is the act, or ſubſtantial form, by which a living Body is a living Body indeed; that is to ſay, by which it hath an inbred power and faculty to perform all the actions of Life. More may be ſeen touching the word <hi>Entelecheia</hi> uſed in this Definition, in Book 1. ch. 9. concerning Motion, where I have at large explained the genuine ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Word.</p>
                  <p>Now a Soul is not the perfection and form of any Body, not of an Artificial, but a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Body; nor yet of every Natural Body: For every Natural Body is not animated; but that Body only, which hath an aptitude to exerciſe the actions of Life, and is ſo diſpoſed that the Soul may thereby, as by Inſtruments, exerciſe its actions. For here we muſt hold out of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in 2 <hi>Metaphyſ. com.</hi> 31. That the action of an Agent does not proceed from the ſubject without a form, nor from the form without a ſubject: for otherwiſe the ſubject and its form would be actually two things. Now if ſo be action cannot be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by a ſubject without a form, nor by a form without a ſubject, much leſs can it be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Inſtruments without a Working cauſe. From whence it follows, that Action is performed by a certain compound of Matter, Form, and Inſtruments; ſo that the whol Compound may be called the Principle which acts; but the Form, the Principle where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the act is performed, becauſe the Compound acts by vertue of the Form; Finally, the Inſtruments, whereby; ſeeing the operation is performed through their ſubſerviency.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, There is alſo another Definition of the Soul in <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in 2. <hi>de Anima,
<note place="margin">Another definition of the Soul</note> cap.</hi> 2. <hi>text.</hi> 18. which is this: <hi>Our Soul is the Principle whereby we live, move, uſe our Senſes, and underſtand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſeeing there are many kinds of Living Creatures; we ſhal beſt come to the knowledg of their Differences, by obſervation of the effects and operations of the Soul; ſince every
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:35070:88"/>cauſe diſcovers it ſelf by its effects, and the form by its operations. Now the proper Ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of the Soul is Life, which as the ſecond act, is evermore attended upon, and companion to the Soul as the firſt act. We may therefore from the diſtinct manners of Life conſtitute the diſtinct ſorts of ſouls and animated things. Now a man lives, and ſo do other Creatures, and ſo do Plants, but each of theſe after a peculiar faſhion. The life of Plants conſiſts in Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition only, and the action proper to each one, but Plants have no Senſes: the life of Brutes, beſides Nutrition and action, contains alſo ſenſe; and each ſort of Bruits hath its proper action: Finally, Man beſides al theſe, does alſo underſtand, and make uſe of Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>There are therefore three diſtinct ſorts of Souls:
<note place="margin">Three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct ſorts of Souls.</note> all which are in Matter, and do conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a living Body: Yet one of them is more looſe from the matter, but another more plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged therein; and one can receive the ſpiritual and immaterial ſpecies of things, wherein conſiſts the force of knowledg, but ſome cannot. Plants are nouriſhed, and underſtand no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; Bruit Animals can underſtand ſome things; they receive immaterial ſpecies, howbeit with ſome conditions of the matter: For what things they perceive are here preſent, and at this time; ſeeing Senſe is buſied about particulars. But the rational Soul receives immaterial ſpecies or repreſentations of things, even without all conditions of matter.</p>
                  <p>And ſeeing the ſoul is the cauſe of various actions,
<note place="margin">Whether the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Soul differ therefrom, and how?</note> and hath the power to perform ſundry operations in living Creatures, we muſt conſider how the powers or faculties of the Soul are related to the Soul it ſelf. And here ſome hold, that the faculties of the Soul are the very Eſſence thereof, which according to the ſundry actions whereof it is the cauſe, hath ſundry names: others contrarywiſe do conceive that the faculties and powers of the ſoul, as all others, are qualities of the ſecond ſort, and that they are really and eſſentially different from the ſoul. And this latter Opinion is the better of the two. For the Powers and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the Soul are indeed only properties and inſeparable accidents thereof, and eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diſtinct therefrom. For the Soul is a ſubſtance, but theſe are accidents or aptitudes and propenſions to operate; which flow from the eſſence of the Soul, as their firſt cauſe, only by emanation, and ſo depend thereon, and are received without any medium, in the ſame animated Body, wherein the Soul is. For every power is ranked amongſt the ſecond ſort of Qualities: and ſeeing the Powers of the Soul themſelves are diſtinct one from another, they muſt alſo differ eſſentially from the Soul: For if they were the ſame with it, they would be the ſame one with another. Howbeit, it is to be obſerved, that the faculties are not mediate Agents, or middle cauſes betwixt the Soul and its operations, but only conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and aptitudes to operate: For operations proceed from the Act, and not from the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer; nor is it neceſſary that betwixt every agent and its operation there ſhould intercede ſome middle agent. For ſo, neither could that middle agent be the cauſe of action, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out another middle agent: and ſo there ſhould a progreſs <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> without end.</p>
                  <p>Theſe divers Souls are with their faculties ſo diſpoſed, that the upper faculty does al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies pre-ſuppoſe the lower: but the inferior may be without the ſuperior. The Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative is without the ſenſitive in Plants: the Vegetative and Senſitive are without the Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal in Bruits: in Man all three concur. But how the Faculties are diſpoſed in reference to the Soul in divers ſorts of Living Creatures, intricate and hard Queſtions are agitated amongſt Phyloſophers.</p>
                  <p>For in the firſt place Enquiry is made,
<note place="margin">Whether in one living thing there is more than one Soul.</note> Whether in every living thing there is only one Soul, or more. For ſome teach, That in every living Creature there is only one Soul, and that it is furniſhed with all the faculties of an inferior Soul; and that there are not in Man three ſouls, an Intelligent, a Senſitive, and a Vegetative; but one that is endued with the powers of all three, and takes its denomination from the nobler faculty: and that ſo the faculties which are in living Creatures of the ſame ſort, do proceed from one ſort of Soul; but thoſe which are in living Creatures of a ſeveral ſort, do ariſe alſo from a ſeveral ſort of Soul; although both here and there they have the ſame names, and are attended by the ſame operations. Others do hold contrarily, That there are diſtinct Souls, not only in living things of ſeveral ſorts; but that more alſo may be found in the ſame living Creature; and that in Man there is not only a nutritive and ſenſitive Faculty, but a nutritive and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Soul, and alſo a rational; and that where-ever the Faculty is, there is alſo the Soul, to which it primarily belongs.</p>
                  <p>And although both Opinions have learned and famous Defenders; yet the firſt which is the commoneſt and moſt received, ſeems to me the more probable. For ſince there is one ſpecifick-Eſſence, and conſequently one only Form of every thing; therefore the Soul of every living thing, which is the Form, and principally conſtitutes the Eſſence thereof, can be but one. Moreover, it is not poſſible, that the principles of things, oppoſite one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:35070:88"/>and ſeveral ſorts of Souls can meet together, without uniting or confounding the Effences of things; or yet be ſubordinate one to another; feeing they are ſuch oppoſites as Logicians call <hi>Disparata,</hi> and do exclude one another out of the ſame ſubject. Moreover, it is a needleſs thing to multiply ſouls; ſince one ſoul, furniſhed with divers faculties may produce all the degrees of life; and a ſoul of an higher degree, and more noble, does include the faculties of the more ignoble and inferior; juſt as the number Four includes the number Three: nor is it neceſſary, though there are in the underſtanding ſubordinate conceptions, by reaſon of ſubordinate differences, that there ſhould therefore be ſubordinate Forms, without the Underſtanding. For the multiplicity of univerſal ſubordinate conceptions does not multiply the Eſſence and Form of a thing.</p>
                  <p>Now the Principal Cauſe that others have erred in this point, hath been this; That they thought the vegetative power alone to be a peculiar Soul, and to conſtitute the ſort of a Plant; and the ſenſitive Faculty alſo to be a peculiar Soul which conſtituted the ſort of Animal: Whereas nevertheleſs there are many ſorts both of Plants and Animals; and the Plants have different ſorts amongſt them, as alſo the Animals, and there is one ſpecifical form of a Roſe, another of a Violet, another of a Willow; though the vegetative Faculty be found in all of them: one of a Lyon, another of a Dog, another of a Wolf, although the ſenſitive Faculty be common to all. All Plants have indeed a nutritive and generative Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, but not that only, but withal ſomwhat proper, whereby a Violet differs from a Roſe and a Willow. So a Wolf is nouriſhed, does generate, and exerciſes its ſenſes, but it does not theſe things alone, but it hath alſo ſomwhat proper to it ſelf, whereby it differs from a Lyon and a Dog; and from the ſame ſoul in a Dog does flow the Faculty of nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing, of ſenſe, and of doing that which is proper to a Dog, whereby it differs from other Animals. Nor are there in a Dog many and divers Eſſences, as the Patrons of the other Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion do erroneouſly ſuppoſe. For neither are the Vegetative and Senſitive, or the Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative, Senſitive, and Rational, certain peculiar general Forms, or three Eſſences; but only general conceptions, ariſing, and conſtituted out of the compariſon and conveniency of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thing, which do no where exiſt ſeparately ſave in the mind; juſt as Beeing; Subſtance, Body: and therefore they do not multiply the Eſſence of things.</p>
                  <p>After this Queſtion follows another: Whether the Soul be totally in the whol Body,
<note place="margin">Whether the ſoul be totally in the whol Body, and totally in every part.</note> and totally in every part? or whether it be all in the whol Body, and part of it in one part, and part in another. But firſt that ambiguity which lutks in this Queſtion, muſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed: For the term <hi>Whol,</hi> may here be conſidered in a three-fold notion; in reſpect of a Subſtance, Quantity, and Quality. The firſt is conſtituted of the parts of the Soul in the ſame living Creature; the ſecond of the Subject, according to the extenſion whereof the Soul is extended, ſo as to have quantity; the third of the faculties, wherewith it is furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. The School-men call the firſt, the Eſſential whol; the ſecond, the Quantitative whol; the third, the Poteſtative whol.</p>
                  <p>As to the firſt, Inaſmuch as the ſoul of every thing is ſimple, and not compounded of Eſſential parts, where ever it is, there it is totally, and ſo as that it is totally in the whol Body. For we muſt not allow of their Opinion, who hold, That the ſubſtance of the Soul is only in one part of the Body, which is the principal part; and that the reſt of the Body is governed by powers ſhed out of the Soul: For thus the whol Body ſhould not be animated, but only that part wherein the ſubſtance of the Soul is: For thoſe Faculties whereby (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Opinion) the reſt of the Members are governed, ſince they are accidents, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſupply the room of a ſubſtantial Form. Moreover, ſince the Faculties are accidents, flowing from the Eſſence of the Soul, only by way of emanation, they cannot have a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject different from their Form, not be produced in any ſubject, ſave that wherein the Soul is; and therefore where they are, there we may know the eſſence of the Soul to be. And therefore we conclude that the Eſſence of the Soul is in all parts of the animated Body, and that no part is deſtitute thereof.</p>
                  <p>Yet is not the Soul in its Body, in all animate things, after one and the ſame manner. For in Plants and ſome Animals, there is no principal Member, but inſtead of a principal Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, a certain humor is diffuſed through the whol Body, by means of which, chiefly, the ſoul is joyned to the Body: whence it is, that alſo the parts being pluckt from the Body do live for a ſeaſon. But the caſe is otherwiſe in perfect Animals, in which we muſt hold that there is ſome principal Member, wherein the ſoul, as in a Root wherein it is naturally inbred as it were, may reſide, and pour it ſelf out to the other Members. And therefore that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Member being hurt, the Animal ſoon dies; but not if any other be hurt; and the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers pluckt from the Body, do preſently die.</p>
                  <pb n="344" facs="tcp:35070:89"/>
                  <p> Secondly, If we enquire how the Soul is in the Body, in reſpect of Extenſion and Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, the Anſwer is briefly this: That every form which informs the matter and is united thereto, and makes up one compound therewith, is extended according to the extenſion of the Matter. Concerning which thing it is nevertheleſs to be obſerved, that only Matter is of it ſelf furniſhed with Quantity, and diviſible; but that the Soul of it ſelf is neither ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Quantitity, nor to Diviſion. In the mean while, becauſe it informs the whol Body, it is rightly ſaid to be coextended therewith, and that where ever the body is that lives, there alſo the Soul is. Hence the Body is properly ſaid to be divided, and to be made greater or leſſer; and the Body of a Plant, from a ſmal Twig, grows to a tall Tree, a Calf to an Ox; and a Body in a Conſumption grows leſs, and ſo doth a Tree whoſe boughs are cut off. But it is not ſo with the Soul; nor is that Soul which is in a ſmal branch, leſs in it ſelf, than the Soul which is in a tall Tree; nor is the Soul of a Calf leſs than the Soul of an Ox, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining the ſame, it ſpreads it ſelf abroad into the additional nutriment; nor is a Plant or Animal the leſs by communicating it ſelf in generation; nor when the branches of a Tree are cut off, is the Soul of the Tree the leſſer; nor hath an Animal that is conſumed a leſſer Soul than that which is corpulent. For the Soul is joyned to the dimenſions, partly as colors, partly after another manner. For it informs the meaſured quantitative Body, and its ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude and fillingneſs is as great as the Body it ſelf and the dimenſion thereof. And though we ſuppoſe the Body to encreaſe never ſo much, the Soul without any addition wil fil it al; and if it be diminiſhed never ſo much, it wil fil no more than that little Body. Of it ſelf therefore the Soul hath no Quantity: but in reſpect of dimenſions whereto it is joyned, it hath ſuch a property, that it fils no more than the Body, be it great or little. And though notwithſtanding by accident its plenitude is reſtrained and contained: yet is it not cut in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or diminiſhed. In which particular it affords a certain reſemblance of the moſt good and great God, who as <hi>J. Caeſar Scaliger</hi> ſpeaks, Reigns every where without place, is all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all, and the whol without parts.</p>
                  <p>Finally, Since divers and ſundry powers do flow from the Soul; the Queſtion is whether the Soul have all theſe powers together, in al the parts of the Body. We anſwer: That in al the parts of the Body, there are al the faculties according to their Original; and that the Soul brings al its faculties into al parts of the Body: yet peculiar ſaculties are only received in peculiar parts as in their ſubjects. For the Soul indeed is in al the parts, which is the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal of al the faculties: yet ſuch is the nature of proper accidents, that it exiſts from a principle or certain cauſe; yet they inſiſt only in a certain Subject. Hence <hi>Scaliger Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercit.</hi> 103. <hi>ſ.</hi> 37. <hi>You ſhal ſee ſome doubt, whether Memory be in all parts of the Body. Nay I tel thee, the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding is in the Feet. For we have one Soul every where at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with its faculties, as being eſſential thereunto. But where there are Inſiruments, there the faculty exerciſes its act. For if there were an Eye in the Finger, the Finger would ſee by that Eye, without calling any power or faculty from the Brain.</hi> For the Soul which is the ſame in al parts of the Body, is indeed every where furniſhed with the ſame faculties; and hath in al members the power to do whatſoever is proper to it; yet it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms certain actions by certain inſtruments; it ſees by the Eye, hears by the Ears, ſmels by the Noſtrils.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe we are fallen upon mention of the principal part,
<note place="margin">Which is the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal part of the Body.</note> and the foregoing Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion can ſcarce be rightly reſolved, without explication of the Controverſie concerning the principal member in man and other ſanguine Creatures, we muſt not omit to handle the ſame. For it is one and the ſame Queſtion, which is the Seat of the Soul, and which is the principal member. For the principality is to be aſſigned to that member wherein the ſoul doth chiefly reſide. Now that there is one principal member Phyloſophers and Payſitians agree, though they contend ſharplyh which it is: and reaſon perſwades the ſame. For ſince the ſoul is not the form of an homogeneal body, but of a body heterogeneal and organical, which hath many and different parts: there muſt of neceſſity be ſome order eſtabliſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, and we muſt beleeve that one of them is more worthy than another: and ſince as hath been ſaid, the Hand, Foot, and other members being cut off, die preſently, the reſt retaining life, we muſt needs think that the Soul hath more affinity to one than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But what that principal member is, the Platoniſts, to whom <hi>Galen</hi> and many Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians joyn, are at variance with the Ariſtotelians or Peripateticks.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> hold three chief Parts, the Liver, Heart and Brain, and they aſſign the principality to the Brain, becauſe therein is the principle of Senſe and motion, and the rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſoul hath there its reſidence. Contrariwiſe, the Peripateticks hold the Heart to be the principal monber.</p>
                  <pb n="345" facs="tcp:35070:89"/>
                  <p> But ſeveral men ſeem to have ſeveral reſpects in their aſſigning the principal part. <hi>Galen</hi> hath reſpect to the nobility of the actions; but the Ariſtotelians reſpect the Radication (that I may ſo ſpeak) of the Soul it ſelf. The Phyſitians count the animal faculties, ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, moſt noble; the Peripateticks make moſt account of the Action of the Heart, becauſe thereby all the reſt are cheriſhed and governed. And therefore though we may grant Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians, that there are three chief members of the Body: Yet if queſtion be made touching the principality, and the radication of the ſoul, ſince there is only one ſoul in every Animal, not many, and one Animal hath only one ſoul and ſpecifick form; we muſt hold there is one principal member, wherein it reſides, as in its Caſtle: although it perform not all its actions therein, but act definitly and diſtinctly in the organs proper and ordained to every diſtinct action.</p>
                  <p>Now if you ſhal ask me which is this member,
<note place="margin">The Heart is the Principal part.</note> I do with the Peripateticks aſlign the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality to the Heart, and hold that the ſoul doth ſtick therein as in its root, from whence it is diffuſed into all the reſt of the members. Yea and the holy Scriptures aſcribe not only the radication of the Soul to the Heart, but certain other actions alſo which moſt men at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute unto the Brain. And indeed this is a very ancient opinion; <hi>Plato</hi> (ſaith <hi>Scaliger</hi> in his 1. Book <hi>de Plantis</hi>) learned theſe things of the wiſe men of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Egyptians learn'd them of the Chaldaeans, out of whoſe decrees all exact literature hath flowed. For the Chaldaeans placed the Principles of all our motions in the Heart, as in their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                  <p>Now that the Heart is the Part wherein the Soul adheres as in its root, and therefore the principal part, is many waies apparent. For that is the principal member, not wherein as in the immediate Inſtrument, the moſt noble action is exerciſed; but that whereon the actions of al parts whether ignoble or noble, do depend, and whereby they are governed. For the prime Agent is more noble than the ſecondary and Inſtrumental Agent. Hence that Argument of <hi>Galen</hi> is invalid, who thus concludes; that is the Principle, from whence the Nerves, Veins, and Arteries ariſe. For that member ſeems to be the fountain and ſeat of the faculty, from which the Inſtruments ariſe. But theſe three kind of Veſſels have their original from three members; the Veins from the Liver, the Arteries from the Heart, the Nerves from the Brain. And therefore there are three chief members, and the moſt excellent is the Brain. For we muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt the prime and chief principle of any operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the inſtrumental or ſecondary principle. For that which is the immediate Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of an action, is not alwaies the firſt and moſt excellent. The immediate principle of ſenſe and motion is the Brain: but yet the ſoul is not rooted therein.</p>
                  <p>Nor is that Argument of greater moment, that when the Brain is hurt, the operations of the ſenſitive Soul are hurt; to which therefore for the ſame cauſe medicaments are applied. For the firſt Agent cannot act without Inſtruments. And therefore when they are hurt, the action is taken away. And therefore, though the Heart which is the immediate Agent be wel, if the Brain which is the immediate Agent be hurt, the action is aboliſhed: after the ſame manner, the Hand being hurt, although the Brain be wel, a man cannot handle or hold a thing; becauſe the immediate Inſtrument of handling is hurt.</p>
                  <p>That therefore muſt be held to be the principal member, which governs all the actions of the whol Body; which breeds the common and moſt familiar Inſtrument of the whol Soul, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſpirits, but that is the Heart: which beſides other tokens, is manifeſt from ſwoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning fits, in which ſenſe and Motion, and all the actions in the body are taken away, through want of ſpirits which ſhould flow from the heart.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, that is the principal Member, according to the unity or plurality whereof there comes to be one or more Animals. For becauſe an Animal by means of one ſoul is one; by means of two, two; that member by the doubling whereof the Animal becomes double, muſt needs be held the ſeat of the Soul. Now that the Heart is ſuch a member <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> tels us, <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Gener. Animal. cap.</hi> 4. and that truly. For experience doth teach us, that by multiplication not of the Brain but Heart, an Animal hath been made double. I wil produce ſome Inſtances collected by <hi>Schenkius, obſervat. Med. P.</hi> 1. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 10. In a certain Town called <hi>Emaus,</hi> in the raign of the Emperor <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> a Boy was born, who to the Navel was perfect, but above he was divided into two, had two breaſts, two Heads with their parts and Sences. For ſomtimes one part would eat, and the other would abſtain, one would ſleep, the other wake, ſomtimes they would play together, laugh and weep, and beat one another. Now they lived neer upon two years. Afterwards it fel out that when one of them died, the other that remained alive died by reaſon of the putrefaction communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated from the other. Again, in the yeer 1531. there was one born, and grew to the ſtature
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:35070:90"/>of a perfect man, who had only two Heads and two Shoulders, ſo that one Head ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the other, and they were wonderfully like in favor, their Eyes and Beards were alike. They had the ſame appetite to meat, were hungry at the ſame time, had the ſame voyce, and both Heads had the ſame deſire to the Wife which he had, and to evacuations. From which Stories it is apparent, that in the firſt who had a double Heart, all the Animal acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were doubled, but in the other, though there were two Heads, yet the actions were ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, and that therefore the Principality belongs to the Heart. For if Senſe, Motion, and other animal actions depend primarily on the Brain, and not on the Heart, why were thoſe actions double only in the former, in whom beſides the Brain there were two hearts; and not in the latter, in whom there were only two Heads?</p>

                     </note> whereby it lives, is nouriſhed, encreaſes, and begets it like. There are belonging to this Soul three faculties: the nouriſhing, growing, and ingendring faculty. The nouriſhing faculty tends to preſerve the Individual or particular living thing; the growing faculty tends to encreaſe the Quantity thereof; the Generative preſerves the kind or ſort. For the nutritive or nouriſhing faculty is that which turns the food into the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the living Body. For ſince the parts of a living Body are conſumed by the native heat, (leſt if there ſhould be a continued reſolution, the Creature ſhould periſh) the nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing faculty was beſtowed thereupon, to repair that which is conſumed. Now this Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of reſolution and nutrition, laſts as long as the life: <hi>for a living Creature is nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed as long it lives.</hi> Ariſtor. 1. <hi>de Gen. et Corrup. cap.</hi> 5. <hi>t.</hi> 41.</p>
                  <p>Now to Nutrition three things are neceſſary, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> teaches 2. <hi>de Anim. cap.</hi> 4. <hi>t.</hi> 49. <hi>The thing nouriſhed, that wherewith it is nouriſhed, and that which doth nouriſh: now that which nouriſhes is primarily the Soul, that which is nouriſhed is the Body which contains it; that wherewith it is nouriſhed, is the food.</hi> Now <hi>Zabarella</hi> hath thus expreſſed the whol nature of nutrition, in <hi>Lib. de Accret &amp; nutrit. cap. ult.</hi> Nutrition is the aggeneration of matter to the parts in a living Body, cauſed by the vegetative ſoul through help of natural heat, out of the food which is taken in; that the matter which is ſteamed away may be reſtored, and that the living Creature may be preſerved, to the end of the term appointed by nature. <hi>Scaliger</hi> thus briefly defines it: Nutrition is a natural union of the changed food.</p>
                  <p>The Principal faculties have other faculties ſubſervient to them,
<note place="margin">Four fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the nutritive.</note> which yet do not ariſe from the Principal. For one faculty doth not poſſeſs another: but they al depend upon, and proceed immediately from the Soul. The nutritive faculty hath four faculties ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient thereunto; the Attractive, Retentive, Concoctive, and Expulſive: others add the Separative, which ſevers things hurtful. The Attractive, is that which draws the food; the Retentive is that which retains it, til it be duly elaborated; the Concoctive, is that which alters it and makes it fit for the living Body: the Expulſive, is that which drives out ſuperfluous matter, which is unfit for nouriſhment.</p>

Now Augmentatation or Growth, according to the definition of <hi>Zabarella de accret. &amp; nutrit. cap.</hi> 25. is the motion of a living Body, whereby the whol Body and al the parts are at once extended according to al dimenſions, ſo as to gain a greater quantity; cauſed by the Vegetative Soul through aſſiſtance of the natural heat from the food taken in, and converted into parts of the ſubſtance of the Body, greater than what hath been conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; that the living Creature may attain to that greatneſs which it ought to have, that it may perform al the operations of Life. For Accretion or Growth differs not from Nutriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the ſubject thereof, matter out of which it is made, and the Efficient Cauſe.

<pb n="347" facs="tcp:35070:90"/>body and all its parts. The End alſo is different: For in Nutrition there is only the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration of what is conſumed; in growth there is an acquiſition of more than is conſumed. Hence <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> 1. <hi>de Generat. &amp; cor. cap.</hi> 5. <hi>text.</hi> 14. <hi>Nutrition is the ſame thing with Accretion or Growth; but they differ reſpectively: For inaſmuch as that which is joyned to the Body, is potentially ſo much fleſh, it is able to encreaſe the body: but inaſmuch as it is potentially bare fleſh, ſo far it is able to nouriſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now becauſe there are many Augmentations improperly ſo called,
<note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> it is worth cur labor to obſerve out of <hi>Ariſtotle, Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Generat. &amp; corrupt. cap.</hi> 5. <hi>t.</hi> 33. three conditions of Accretion or Growth properly ſo called, or three things neceſſary to Accretion. 1. <hi>Not only the whol Body muſt become greater, but alſo every part thereof.</hi> 2. <hi>It ought to become greater, by means of ſome matter coming from without.</hi> 3. <hi>That which is augmented muſt continue the ſame thing in number which it was before.</hi> In the firſt condition is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained the proper nature of Accretion. For though ſome doubt (ſince many mutations concur in Accretion, and not only the addition of Aliment, but alſo extenſion is neceſſary) in what mutation the nature thereof ſhould conſiſt: yet their Opinion is the truer, which joyn both theſe mutations together, and hold that Accretion or Growth conſiſts both in the converſion of the matter of the Aliment into the ſubſtance of the living Creature, and alſo in the extenſion of the ſaid Creature. For Growth is cauſed by ſomwhat coming to the body, and the thing grown hath changed its place, 1. <hi>de Gener. &amp; Cor. cap.</hi> 5. <hi>text.</hi> 25.</p>
                  <p>Now, after what manner a greater quantity is acquired in a living Creature, Authors are alſo at variance; Some conceive it is done by driving, and that one part drives another, and another another, after the ſame manner as we ſee it is in the Nails and Hairs: But this is not agreeable to truth. They think more rightly, who beleeve that it is done by extenſion, viz. When the Aliment is extended through all the parts of the body, and through all the different poſtures of the ſaid parts; which comes to paſs when all the Pores are filled, which being full, the parts are extended: and all the parts being extended and augmented, the whol body is alſo encreaſed; after the ſame manner as we ſee a ſpunge grow great, after the water hath inſinuated it ſelf into all the parts thereof. Now according to the extenſion of the Body, the ſoul is alſo extended: and if any man will call it being ſo extended, greater, let him remember, that a Form of it ſelf is neither great nor little. Hence <hi>Scaliger,</hi> Exercit. 101. Sect. 15. <hi>The Form when it extends it ſelf into the newly applied matter, it advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it ſelf, but is not encreaſed: For it does not generate a new Form. And verily he that ſhall call a Form greater or leſſer, will abuſe the patience of wiſe men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now living Creatures are not alwaies augmented, but only to a certain term of their age; the cauſe whereof is not in the ſoul: For neither it, nor its Faculties, which are proper to its Eſſence, are corrupted or weakened, but only the body. Nor is the cauſe in the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral heat; for that is as ſtrong in a yong man, as in a boy. But the impediment is in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; viz. the bones, which are the chief part that is augmented, and according to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe whereof the whol body is encreaſed, are more moiſt and ſoft in youth, and more apt to be extended; but in ſucceeding Ages they are ſo dried and hardened by the natural hear, that they become unapt to be extended. Although in ſome elderly perſons the fleſh and fat are many times augmented, yet that is no true growth, becauſe the whol body is not aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, but only the ſofter parts.</p>
                  <p>Finally, The generative Faculty is that which by the prolifick ſeed begets its like:
<note place="margin">
                        <p>The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</p>
                        <p>The defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of generation.</p>
                     </note> And the Generation of a living Creature, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> defines it, <hi>de Vita et Morte, cap.</hi> 10. <hi>Is the firſt participation of the Vegetative Soul with heat.</hi> For living Creatures are ſaid to beget their like, when they give out ſomwhat of their own matter, and their own form; which is then done when they yield their ſeed. <hi>For in the ſeed there is both the matter and form of a Dog forth coming: Nor does the ſeed of a Dog differ from a Dog, otherwiſe than as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude from Act; and there is nothing added to the ſeed, but an expreſſion of thoſe Organs which were before confuſed,</hi> ſaies <hi>Scaliger</hi> in Exercit. 268. and Exercit. 6. Sect. 5. and 7. <hi>The form is in the Dogs ſeed, in the aptitude whereof it is ſaid to be; becauſe the ſeed is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and apt to give that form which it contains in it ſelf; or becauſe it wants the expreſs Inſtruments, which afterward the Soul frames to it ſelf, both by altering the whol, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the parts, and is its ſelf the builder of its own houſe.</hi> And in the ſame Exercit. Sect. 10. <hi>Therefore a Tree generates when it produces its ſeed. But a Tree is not then generated, when it ſprouts up out of the ſeed; but then the generated Tree, which was before imperfect, becomes perfect. So a Dog does not ingender when the whelp is brought forth, but when he ingenders ſeed: Becauſe in the very act of copulation many have died, before
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:35070:91"/>the ſeed received any diſpoſition or qualification in the Womb. Which we ſee more evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Plants: For the Almond Tree being dead, a planted Almond taken therefrom grows up to a Tree. Now the Soul engenders a Soul by promotion of it ſelf; after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner truly, as in growing it inſinuates it ſelf into the new matter of the nouriſhment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now Living Creatures obtained this Faculty of propagating their kind, from their firſt Creation by God, when he bleſſed all living Creatures, ſaying, <hi>Encreaſe and multiply;</hi> and again, <hi>Let the Earth bring forth Graſs, the Herb yielding ſeed, and the fruit Tree yielding fruit, whoſe ſeed is in it ſelf, upon the Earth:</hi> and again, <hi>Let the Waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the Earth in the open Firmament of Heaven:</hi> and again, <hi>Let the Earth bring forth the Living Creature after his kind, Cattle, and creeping things, and the Beaſts of the Earth after their kind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Howbeit the manner of the Propagation of living things is various. In Plants indeed if a branch of Willow be pluckt from the Tree, the Soul is divided by diviſion of the matter, and abides in the branch; and therefore from the ſaid branch ſtuck into the Earth, a Tree of the ſame ſort will grow up. The ſame is done in other Plants by their Roots, in others by their ſeeds, and in others after other manners propagation is cauſed; as may be ſeen in the Writers of Husbandry. In all which nevertheleſs it is neceſſary, that the matter taken away may afford a fitting Manſion for the ſoul; which every part in all Plants cannot afford. For examples ſake, A Willow is propagated by a bough ſtuck in the Earth; but a Pear-tree cannot be propagated after the ſame manner.</p>
                  <p>But in Animals or living creatures, although the manner of Propagation may alſo ſeem to be various, whiles ſome produce Egs, others living creatures: yet herein they ſeem al to agree, in that Animals do not generate by any part of their body pluckt off as Plants, but by ſeed, or ſomwhat which anſwers to ſeed.</p>
                  <p>For the ſeed which <hi>Epicurus</hi> (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> relates, <hi>de placit. Philoſ. Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.) called <hi>an Abſtract of the Soul and Body,</hi> being cut off from the reſt of the body, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the diviſion of the ſubject, the Soul is alſo divided, and ſome portion thereof is with the ſeed ſeparated from the Animal; which being of the ſame ſpecies with the Soul from whence it is taken, is now become numerically different, in regard of the ſubject. Out of the ſeed, by reaſon of this ſoul, a new Animal ariſes, while the ſoul lying hid in the ſeed, rouſes it ſelf, and diſplaies its Faculties, and by operating manifeſts it ſelf; and making uſe of the innate heat and ſpirits, it begins to ſhape al things neceſſary to the conſtitution of an Animal or livnig creature, and diſtinguiſhes, diſpoſes, orders forms, and faſhions the ſubject matter; that ſo it may have a perfect and fitting houſe, like to that from whence it came, and that it may have Inſtruments in a readineſs, whereby it may put forth al its Faculties, and exerciſe al its natural Actions; which houſe it afterward poſſeſſes, after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as it inſinuates it ſelf into the new matter of Aliment, when the Creature grows.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit, there is betwixt Plants and Animals, eſpecially the more perfect ſort, this difference; That Plants which breed ſeed, breed it ſo qualified, that it alone ſuffices to the production of a like Plant: but in the more perfect Animals which have Sex, the ſeed of neither Parent is ſufficient to beget their like; but as <hi>Plato</hi> hath it, Each Sex contributes its ſhot to the matter of Generations; and the ſeed of neither Sex taken alone, but of both joyned together, and united in the Womb of the Female, is prolifick and fruitful ſeed.</p>

                  <p>SInce therefore there are three manners of Life, and Plants live, are nouriſhed, grow, and generate; Bruits have beſides, the uſe of ſenſe and local motion; and a Man beſides all theſe, hath the uſe of Reaſon: having ſpoke of the Vegetative Soul, before we ſhall ſpeak of the Senſitive and Rational Soul,
<note place="margin">The defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of a plant.</note> we muſt firſt treat of Plants. <hi>Now a Plant</hi> (which the Greeks call <hi>Phuton) is a Body animated and vegetative, or endowed with a nutritive and generative faculty.</hi> Where I muſt in the firſt place acquaint you with this, of which mention was made before, viz. How that many are of opinion, that all ſorts of Plants have no other Faculty but the Vegetative, which is common to the whol kind, but that only the ſame kind is reſtrained by certain bounds to the proper faculty of its own ſort. But this is a falſe Opinion: For if the caſe were ſo, there ſhould be indeed no ſpecifical dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:35070:91"/>in Plants and Animals; nor ſhould a Roſe differ from an Oak, nor a Mouſe from a Lyon, except in ſome Accidents. But thus we are to hold; That the Vegetative Soul alone does not conſtitute any ſort of Plants; nor does the ſenſitive Soul conſtitute any ſort of bruits, but only an Animal or Living creature, which is the kind comprehending Man and Beaſt: but the ſorts of Plants and Animals do differ by their ſpecifick forms; as namely a Roſe from an Oak, a Fir-tree from a Violet, a Dog from a Wolf, and a Wolf from a Lion and a Man. And from the difference of forms proceeds this diverſity of Actions, ſo that among Living Creatures ſome are more ingenious than others. And in vain it is that ſome anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly diſpute, Whether ſome Animals beſides Man, are not Rational?
<note place="margin">whether ſom bruits are ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal?</note> For thoſe actions we ſee in ſome Animals which are more ingenious than others, do not proceed from a Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Soul, which is proper only to Man; but from the Soul that is proper to that ſort of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal. For as a Roſe hath one ſoul, a Poplar another, and therefore the Roſe and the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar have different operations: even ſo, as there is one ſoul of a Sheep, another of a Sow, another of a Dog, another of a Fox, another of a Lyon, another of an Elephant; ſo alſo all theſe ſorts of Living Creatures do differ both in the ſtructures of their bodies, and in their ſpecifical actions. And although in ſome ſorts of Animals actions appear ſufficiently wonderful; yet the ſoul of Man hath only gained a proper name, and is termed Rational: the reſt are for the moſt part deſtitute of proper appellations. But that we may ſpeak now of Plants; every Plant conſiſts of a proper ſoul, and of a body convenient to its ſort.</p>
                  <p>We have already ſpoken of the Soul, it remains that we ſhould ſpeak of the Body.
<note place="margin">Whether there are two Sexes in Plants?</note> But firſt there is a Queſtion that preſents it ſelf: Whether the two Sexes are in Plants? To it <hi>Scaliger</hi> anſwers, in 1. <hi>de Plantis:</hi> There are in Plants (quoth he) the principles of Male and Female conſounded, and that by an excellent deſign of Nature. For ſince Generation is made by an agent in a Patient; Nature hath put into her work, to which ſhe had denied Motion and granted Generation, proportionable generative faculties joyned together, which may be alſo hence collected: Becauſe in ſome Plants it is ſeen, that of one ſeed the male, of another the Female does ſpring up. Which is apparent in Hemp; Out of the ſame trunk proceeds ſeed, which partly grows to be Male, and partly Female.</p>
                  <p>Now ſome parts of Plants are neceſſary to the conſtitution of the whol Body;
<note place="margin">The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements of Plants.</note> others are ſuperfluous. There are ſome hard Excrements, as Muſhroms, and Puck-fiſts; ſome ſoft, as tears; and of theſe, ſome remain liquid; others grow hard, as Gums.</p>

                     </gap> 'tis hard, and termed <hi>Caudex</hi> the ſtock. The ſtalk and ſtock parts into branches, and the part where the branch iſſues is properly called a knot; the branches are divided into boughs and twigs; beſides theſe there are ſuckers, or ſmal twigs that grow up out of the Root.</p>
                  <p>Our of the boughs and twigs ſpring the Leaves,

                  <p>The Flowers to Plants are as the child in the womb,
<note place="margin">Flowers.</note> which come to perfection in the ſeed and fruit, or they are rather the firſt covering of the fruit. Now the Flowers conſiſt of a moſt thin exhalation and a ſubtil ſpirit, which breaks forth when any Plant does grow wanton and big with deſire of generation. For there is no emiſſion of ſeed without ſuch a ſpirit, nor any propagation of the ſoul, in Plants nor in Animals. Now the Flower includes within it ſelf, and defends the fruit when it firſt breaks forth, till it becomes more firm and able to bear the injuries of the Air. For then the ſpirit ceaſing and failing, which breaks out with the fruit, and in the act of Generation, the flower falls off. Howbeit all Plants do not bloſſom, nor do all that bloſſom bear fruit. Now the flowers are compounded of divers parts: For they conſiſt of very thin Leaves, ſeverally colored, ſhaped, and ranked in ſeveral Plants.
<note place="margin">the Cup.</note> Then is the Cup wherein the little Leaves are planted as in their baſis, and wherein they are ſhut as in a caſe.

                  <p>Finally,
<note place="margin">Fruit.</note> there is the Fruit, by which word we ſomtimes underſtand the ſeed; ſomtimes beſide the ſeed, the fleſh with the ſeed is after a ſpecial manner termed Fruit. For the ſeed is either contained in Cods, as that of beans and peaſe; or in Caſes; or in the pulp of the fruit, as in prunes, pears, cherries. Now the Greeks term that ſame fleſh or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which compaſſes the ſeed, <hi>Pericarpium.</hi> And of theſe parts do Plants conſiſt, and ſome have all theſe parts, others not. And ſome have only one of them, others more. The whol ſubſtance of a Puckſiſt is well near all Root. Contrarywiſe ſome have no Root, as Miſſelto which is ſuſtained and nouriſhed by the Root of another Plant. Alſo Toad-ſtools have commonly no Root. A Ruſh hath no branches; Dodder no Leaves; the Fig-tree no flower; the Orice flower no fruit; Maiden-hair neither flower nor fruit.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe parts, ſome Plants alſo have others, which grow out of an excrementious humor. Such is the moſs of old Trees, the little ſpunges on Dogs-bryar, and other excreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences on other Trees.</p>

                  <head>Chap. 4. <hi>Of the Differences of Plants.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>NOW Plants are divided into four kinds:
<note place="margin">the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Plants.</note> 
                     <hi>Dendron,</hi> a Tree; <hi>Thamnos</hi> a Shrub; <hi>Phruganon</hi> a Buſh, (which <hi>Gaza</hi> calls <hi>Suffrutex,</hi> though <hi>Scaliges</hi> like not that word, <hi>Exercit.</hi> 139.) and <hi>Botane</hi> an Herb. Now how theſe kinds differ, is not ſo manifeſt. They are commonly diſtinguiſhed by their Trunk, and their continuance: but <hi>Scaliger</hi> likes not this kind of Diviſion, <hi>Exercit.</hi> 389. For alſo Harts-tongue laſts all the year without any Trunk. And Lettice and Coleworts have a kind of trunk, which are Herbs. He therfore both <hi>in the place alleadged, and in his</hi> 1. <hi>de Plantis,</hi> thus diſtinguiſhes them: An Herb ſends from the Root Leaves, beſides thoſe two common to all, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently iſſue out of the pulp of the ſeed changed; and in proceſs of time a ſtalk, though ſome never have any. But in a Tree and buſhy ſhrub theſe Leaves do not firſt come forth, but in the firſt place a ſtalk, and that one, or many; if one, either it is a great one, and that is a Tree; or a little one, and that is a ſhrub; or if many, then it is a buſh: and it is the property of a Tree not to die and come up again; but ſhrubs and buſhes do ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue as trees, and others die and come up again, as Herbs. Thus then a tree and a ſhrub agree, That each hath a ſingle trunk. But they differ in greatneſs, and ſomtimes in yearly dying. A buſh differs from a tree in ſmalneſs, and therein it agrees with a ſhrub; but it differs from both in the multiplicity of its ſtems or trunks. There is no need it ſhould laſt all the yeer, no more than that a ſhrub ſhould. An Herb agrees with a ſhrub in the ſingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:35070:92"/>of its ſtem, as the Colewort; ſomtimes with a buſh, in the multitude of its ſtems, as Fennel; ſomtimes with neither, by having no ſtalk.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſeems not to have perfectly explained the whol Buſineſs; and eſpecially there is a doubt concerning the Shrub, which he will have to be ſingle ſtemmed, becauſe he held that the ſhrub had but a ſingle ſtem: whereas others attribute a manifold ſtem to the ſhrub, and they ſay that is a ſhrub which amongſt wooden Plants is of ſmalleſt height and thickneſs, ſuch as Rue, Sage, Hyſop, Marſh-mallows.</p>
                  <p>In ſearching out the Univerſal Nature of Plants, we muſt diligently enquire into their differences: which are indeed very many, ſo that it is hard to omit nothing, and in the mean while, not to produce things unprofitable and ſuperfluous. Now theſe differences are taken from their Original, Native place, internal form, external ſigure and matter. Now ſince the internal forms lie hid, nor are known to the ſenſe, they muſt be known from the vertues and qualities which proceed from them.</p>
                  <p>And firſt from the manner of propagation, which is manifold. For, firſt of all, ſome Plants ſpring of their own accord, in ſuch places as are far from the reſort of men, and are not capable of tillage. For the Earth hath in it the hidden ſeeds of Plants, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world, inſerted thereinto by the Divine Benediction, and ſhe ſends them forth out of her boſom; or ſhe receives ſeeds brought from elſewhere by Winds and Rains, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means, and cheriſhes them in her lap; which manner notwithſtanding does appertain to that which follows. For in the ſecond place, ſome Plants ſpring from others. For firſt ſome Plants are propagated by ſeed; ſome by roots, bul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s, boughs and branches, and ſome are propagated by one of theſe, others by more: ſome ſpring from ſeed alone, as Smallage, Marjoram, Henbane; others hardly or never of ſeed, as the Fig-tree; others late, as the Peony; others of a Root alone, as the Hop, and Acorus; others of ſeed and branches, as the Roſematy. And the way of propagation by branches is again threefold; For either the branch or bough plucked off, is ſimply ſtuck in the Earth; and ſo the Willow and Roſemary are propagated; or the branch is inſerted into another trunk, which is called Graſting; or when the Suckers which ariſe from the Root are pulled away. Or when a branch neer the Root hath its lower half covered with Earth, the upper part remaining free. For then that branch ſends out Roots into the Earth: which being done, a yeer or two after that branch is cut off from the Tree, and becomes a peculiar Plant: or of one Plant many are made. So the Dreſſers of Vineyards are wont to wean their Vines.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, Some Plants grow in moiſt places, others in dry. Thoſe which grow in moiſt places, grow either in the water it ſelf, or near the water, as on the banks, or upon Walls and Rocks, and other places, which are moiſtened by the appulſe, or ſprinkling, or vapor of the waters, as Liver-wort and Maiden-hair. Thoſe which grow in the waters, grow either on the top, as Duck-weed, or from Roots. Alſo ſome never mount above the water, as the kinds of <hi>Alga,</hi> Sea-weed, or Ore-wood; others ſpring above the water, as <hi>Aquapium.</hi> Again, ſome grow in Brooks, others in Fountains, others in Ponds, Pools, and Lakes; ſome grow in the Sea, others in other places where water hath been, but now is not, as <hi>Xanthium,</hi> or Ditch-bur. Again, Land Plants do grow ſome on Mountains, Hills, Rocks, Walls, Houſe-ſides, upon hedges, in fields, meadows, Vineyards, Woods: others in plain places, earthy, gravelly, ſandy, or clayiſh.</p>
                  <p>To the Native place alſo belongs this conſideration, that ſome Plants are inſtead of ground to others which grow upon them, as to Moſs and Miſſelto which grows upon the Oak, the Holm, the Pear-tree, the Hazel, the Linden, the Birch, the Apple-tree, the Plum-tree, the Fir, the Pine, the Elder, and Cheſtnut-tree.</p>
                  <p>Moſt indeed of the Ancients were of Opinion, That the Thruſh having eaten Miſſelto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, the pulp being digeſted, the ſeed was caſt out with the dung, and falling upon ſuch Trees as the Thruſh uſed to ſit upon, from that a new Plant of Miſſelto ſprung upon the ſaid trees. But this conceit is not agreeable to Reaſon: For it is not probable, that the ſeed can ſo cleave the barks and pierce into the hard wood of a tree. And why ſhould it not grow upon many more trees on which thoſe birds neſtle, as wel as on the foreſaid? Nor hath there ever any ſeed been found in the maws of Thruſhes that have fed upon Miſſelto-berrirs. Moſt likely therefore it is, That Miſſelto is like the horns which ſpring out of the bones of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, and that the principles of Miſſelto, in a juyce Natural thereunto, being cheriſhed by the internal heat, and aſſiſted by the heat external, do grow together into this Plant.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, ſome Plants grow moſt ſpeedily and attain their perfection, others very
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:35070:93"/>ſlowly; ſo that this difference is manifeſt in the Alder, Willow, Peach, Pitch-tree, and Oak.</p>
                  <p>Again, ſome laſt all the yeer, as Trees and Capillary Herbs; ſome continue not. And of theſe ſome die and grow no more, as Wheat, Barley; others grow again, as Gentian. And of theſe ſome laſt all the yeer, as Agrimony; and ſome periſh within the compaſs of a yeer in ſeveral manners. For ſome laſt one month, others three months; ſome two years, others three, and others four. Again, ſome are perpetually green, as the Fir, the Box; in others their Leaves fall off, and grow again.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, ſome are fruitful, others barren; ſome bear flowers only, others both flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and fruit; and ſome only once in their life, others often; and that either yearly, or every other year: and ſome flower in their firſt year; others in the ſecond, third, and ſome not till their fourth yeer.</p>
                  <p>Alſo in their figure and other qualities partly ariſing from their forms, there is a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity. For ſome are ſtraight, others crooked, round, cornered, Turbant-faſhioned, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, ſolid, prickly, without any knot. They differ in ſubſtance, which is ſpungy, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, ſoft, hard, thick, thin, fat, clammy. Some are temperate, others hot, cold, moiſt, dry; ſome are ſmooth, others rough, thorny, hairy, downy. The taſt of ſome is ſweet, of others bitter, biting, ſalt, harſh, ſowr; others are void of taſt. Alſo ſome Plants have taſt in al their parts, others in ſome only. Some have no ſmel, others have a ſtrong ſmel, others a ſweet; ſome a vehement ſmel, others a weak; ſome ſmel totally, others only in ſome part.</p>
                  <p>There is no leſs variety in their colors. For though al Plants are green; yet ſome are more, others leſs green; ſome are of a light, others of a deep green; in ſome there is a whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh greenneſs, in others a yellowiſh, in ſome a reddiſh; ſome are ſpotted, and others have no ſpots.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, there is a great difference of Plants in reſpect of the parts whereof they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. For the juyce wherewith they are nouriſhed, and which anſwers to the blood in Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creatures, repreſents water in ſome, milk in others, as in Spurge; in ſome it hath a Saffron dye, as in great Celandine; in others it repreſents Oyl: and therefore it differs much in color and taſt. Alſo ſome juyce is wholſom, another purging, another vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.</p>
                  <p>Again, The Fibres in ſome Plants are ſtreight, in others oblique, ſmal, thick, ſoft, hard. The fleſh is in ſome thick, compact; in others ſpungy, taſtful, taſtleſs; alſo it is of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſmel and color in different Plants. The Bark is fleſhy, nervous, clammy, in color, taſt, ſmel, much different: And the ſame differences we find in the Wood. The Matrix or Marrow, is in ſome ſolid, in others ſpungy.</p>
                  <p>Alſo there is a great difference of the Roots of Plants. You have a Root great, ſmal, long, ſhort, continued, cut off; round like a Globe; ſingle and manifold; fibrous; col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, ſpreading; deep, ſhallow; thick, thin; ſoft, hard; ſtiff, limber; criſped, even; ſtreight, bending; compact, ſpungy; fleſhy, barkiſh, woody; round, turbant faſhioned; ſingle, double; hairy, ſmooth; rough, glib; moſſie, juycie, dry; conſiſting of ſcales, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; crumbly, ſoluble, boylable, eſculent; heavy, light; white, yellowiſh, red, black; ſweet ſmelling, ſtinking; bitter, ſweet. A great Root bears a great Plant; a little Root, a little Plant; a great Root bears a ſmal Plant, as in a Turnep; a little Root a great Plant, as in a Pine-tree: as <hi>Jul. Caeſar Scaliger</hi> hath collected, and digeſted theſe differences, in 1. <hi>de Plantis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſtems do ariſe ſome before the Leaves, others with the Leaves, in ſome they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual, in others annual; in ſome ſtreight, crooked, trailing on the ground, growing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, thick, thin, ſolid, hollow, knotty, without knots, woody, herby, round, four ſquare, three cornered, nervous, ſtreaked, ſmooth, rough.</p>
                  <p>The variety of Leaves is thus digeſted by <hi>Jul. Caeſ. Scaliger,</hi> in 1. <hi>de Plantis.</hi> In reſpect of ſhape: there are round Leaves, as in Penny-wort, or Two-penny graſs; almoſt round, as in Bindweed, ſmal Celandine, Aſarabacca; oblong in Hyſop; plain in the greateſt part of Plants; round and long in Stone-crop; with a continued edg in the Birthworts; with a creſted edg in the Lawrel; a Saw-faſhioned edg in the Elm; blunt teeth in Scordium; large toothed in the two Cichories; ful of bendings in the third kind of Cichory, which they call Monks-head; forked in the <hi>Caucalis</hi> or baſtard Parſley; ſingered in Ellebore and Woolfs-bane, lobed in Fern, hair-like in Fennel. In reſpect of their Surface, they are rough, biting, ſharp-pointed, in Borrage, Nettles, Artichoaks; they are prickly either by reaſon of their kind, and that continually, as the But-Thiſtle; or by age in a kind, as the
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:35070:93"/>Sow-Thiſtle. Some have for Leaves real Thorns, as the <hi>Corruda</hi> or wild Aſparagus; ſome as it were Thorns or Prickles, as the Juniper. Many have thin leave, Purſlane have thick. The Leaves of moſt Plants hang on by a ſmal ſtalk, which is ſtreight or crooked, long or ſhort. Some have no ſtalks, as the Lilly. Alſo from the places of the Plant; from the root, from the ſtem, from the branches; on the top; on the bottom. The Flower-de luce hath ſharp-pointed Leavs, moſt Plants have them blunt. In reſpect of Quantity: they are great, little, broad, narrow; ſingle, manifold, In point of relation and ſcituation, ſome grow thick and cloſe together, ſome grow thin and far aſunder. In reſpect of colour; they are al in a manner green, but with a vatious greenneſs; ſome few are pale-green, as a ſort of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rach; ſome red as another ſort of Orach and Beets. Alſo ſome naturally die by ſickneſs in the Autumn, as the Bramble, the Vine, the Apple-tree. In point of ſcituation; ſome ſtand bolt upright, others hang down, ſome are ſaddle-ſhap'd, crooked, criſped, rouled together, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed as the Lettuce; ſtreaked, nerved, veined, with bending Gutters. And what hath been omitted in the former differences; as the ſoft, hard, leatheriſh, limber, brittle, ſhining, dul, woolly, hairy, ſmelling ſweet, acid, bitter, ſalt, ſweet, harſh, taſtleſs, continued, with holes bored through, or holes as it were, as in St. Johns-wort. Alſo the diſpoſitions of trembling, of falling, of abiding, and turning according to the Sun. Alſo of order; ſome are ſet in a confuſed manner, others are orderly placed; ſome alternatively do cloath the branch at equal diſtances, ſome are ſet juſt one againſt another, whether they be two, three, or four, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing the branch like a Crown. Some breed one Leaf upon another.</p>
                  <p>Flowers do ſome of them come out before the Leaves, as in the Peach; others after the Leaves; ſome come out the firſt year with the Plants, others the ſecond or third yeer, and ſome later. Alſo in reſpect of the time of the yeer, there is great variety. For ſome flower in the Winter, as black Hellebore; ſome at the beginning, others at the end of the Spring, ſome in the Summer: and ſome flower once a yeer, others twice, others thrice. Alſo the ſcituation and place from whence Flowers grow, is not the ſame: for the moſt part, they grow out of the ſtock, the branch or twigs; yet ſomtimes from the Roots. And ſome flowers ſtick on the ſmal ſtalks, and thoſe either long or ſhort; Some come out of one Cup, others out of divers Cups; ſome come out like cluſters of Grapes, others like ears of Corn, others in a round tuft, on ſome there are more flowers, on others fewer, and ſome of them have many, ſome few leaves. Some Flowers are fertile, others barren, and theſe do ſome of them compaſs the fruit, others are ſeated therein. Alſo there is a great difference in the falling off of the Flowers, ſome fall off more ſlowly, others go away in Down, ſome are contracted, others dried.</p>
                  <p>The ſame variety is in the colors, odors, taſt, and ſhape, al which can ſcarce be perfecty ſet down.</p>
                  <p>Finally, The ſame variety is to be ſeen in the Seeds, and Fruits. For ſome Plants bear fruit, others not, as Harts-tongue. Of thoſe which bear fruit, ſome bear much, others lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; ſome once every year, ſome twice, others thrice; again ſome beat fruit only once in three yeers. Some bear fruit early, others late; the Mulberry Tree flowers late, its fruit comes ſuddenly to perfection; contrariwiſe the Peach-Tree ſoon flowers, but is long ere it bear fruit. Again ſome flower late, and bring forth late fruit. Some have fruit and no flower, as the Fig-Tree; ſome have flowers without fruit, as the Flower-de-luce; but for the moſt part the fruits come out of the flowers. Some have fruit of only one kind, others of divers kinds, as the Oak. Some produce fruit from their root and ſtem, ſome at their boughs, others on the boughs under the leaves, on the leaves, above the leaves; and the fruit ſticks upright, or dangles, or ſticks faſt, or ſits, or cleaves, with a ſtalk, without a ſtalk, ſingle, double, one, divers, thick together, here and there, far aſunder, rare.</p>
                  <p>The Seeds grow, ſome of them naked, others are ſhut up in ſome other ſubſtance. And ſome are contained in ſome humor, others in a ſhel or bone, others in an hollow bag, and ſomtimes in one fruit one ſeed, and ſomtimes many, either ranked in order, or without or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. There is no leſs diverſity in their figures; ſome are round, others oblong, ſome repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent one thing, ſome another. In the bags or cods wherein the ſeeds are contained there is the like Variety. For ſome of the Cods may be eaten, but the grain not, as the Ceratia or Careb fruit. Of ſome the pulp only is eſculent, as the Caſſia: ſome cods are not at al eſculent, as of Bean, Lupines, horned Poppy; ſome boyled are all eaten cod and fruit, as french Beans: of ſome only the Surface is eaten, the skin being left, as of Peaſe and the Pigeons-Vetch. Alſo from the figure there is much difference: alſo from the ſubſtance of the Grains, their magnitude, figure, number, marrow, bark, color, ſcituation. <hi>Scaliger</hi> in 1.
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:35070:94"/>
                     <hi>de Plantis.</hi> In fruits alſo, the Rind wherewith they are covered, is thin or thick, hard, boney, woody, ſmooth, rough; and al fruits are covered with fleſh, skin, or ſhel. And with it they are either totally covered, or half covered, and that not after one manner. For an Acorn is covered in one manner, an Hazel Nut after another manner. Alſo there is great diverſity of taſt in fruits; yea and in one part there is one fruit, in another another. Alſo ſome fruits may be eaten, others not; and in ſome that which is to be eaten is within, as in Almonds; in others both the kernel may be eaten, and the pulp which doth compaſs the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Now to illuſtrate theſe differences of Plants with examples would be too redious. This as it hath been done by others; ſo <hi>Andreas Matthiolus</hi> a moſt learned Herbaliſt, <hi>in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face upon</hi> Dioſcorides, hath both collected all this variety, and ſhewed how Plants differ in their native place, their roots, ſtalks, flowers, ſeeds, and fruits.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>FOraſmuch as that which <hi>Jul. Caeſ. Scaliger</hi> writes <hi>in his Exercit.</hi> 104. <hi>ſect.</hi> 6. <hi>To collect out of Books ſuch things as have been delivered by the ancients is very dangerous: the true knowledg of things is learnt of the things themſelves;</hi> is both true in other things and moſt true in the Doctrine of Plants: they that would gain the knowledg of Plants muſt of neceſſity know the Plants themſelves. And although in this Age of ours, he Art of Printing hath afforded great helps to this Intent; ſeeing not only the Hiſtory of Plants hath been deſcribed and publiſhed by many, but alſo the Plants have been delineated, and painted out with elegant pictures, by many learned men, eſpecially <hi>Tragus, Matthiolus, Fuchſius, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lechampius, Pena, Lobelius, Dodonaeus, Cluſius, Taberno-montanus, Baubinus</hi> and others; by which it is much eaſier to know the Plants than by their deſcriptions alone: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs Plants are beſt of all known by view of the Eye-ſight.</p>
                  <p>And ſeeing in this place it is impoſſible, by way of compendium to reckon up al plants, much more impoſſible to deſcribe the ſame; and that yet it is very profitable to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Plants, to have the knowledg of certain general heads, to which al Plants may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; I have thought good in this place to propound certain Tribes, and a method as it were of Herbariſme, with the names of the principal, and the virtues of ſuch as are moſt in uſe. For though I know ſome have been extreamly ſollicitous, laboring to reduce all to Dichotomies: yet how unhappily they have acquit themſelves therein, the ſucceſs doth ſhew. And therfore I have choſe herein rather to imitate <hi>Lobel</hi> and others, who have diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted ſome Plants at leaſt into certain Tribes. It wil be eaſie for any man to fetch the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty diviſions and enumerations from the foreſaid Authors, and there to ſee their Pictures and Deſcriptions. Only this I ſhal hint by the way, that many are indeed ſuperſtitious in reckoning up abundance of names and differences of Plants; but very ſhort and bare in ſeeking out their virtues. It is better in my opinion, to know fewer Plants, and to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand their virtues withal, than to be able to reckon up the names of abundance, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny illiterate Gardeners are able to do; and to be quite ignorant of their faculties and Qualities.</p>

                     <p>Since Nature, yea rather God himſelf the Author of Nature, contrives and works nothing without order; and that order is alſo moſt cleerly to be ſeen in Plants; therefore I think fit to begin with Muſhrumps, and Puck-fiſts, which are as it were the Rudiments of Plants. Puck-fiſts grow within the Earth, without any ſtalk, leaf, ſibre or thred. Moſhrumps do ſome grow out of the Earth, others upon the ſtocks of Trees. Thoſe which grow out of the Earth, are ſome of them ſoon ripe, in April: others come late, in Autumn; among which there is great difference, from their ſhape, color, and other Qualities; and ſome are fit to be eaten, others are venemous. The ſeveral kinds have in ſundry nations their peculiar names.
<note place="margin">Crepltus lupi, <hi>the round Puck-ſiſt.</hi>
                        </note> There is alſo a peculiar ſort, round like a ball, ſticking to the ground without any ſtalk, whitiſh in color, which being dry becomes poudery: it dries without any biting, and is therefore uſed to heal places where the Skin is galled off, and by Surgeons to ſtop Blood.</p>
                     <p>Among Muſhrumps that grow on Trees,
<note place="margin">Agarick.</note> the moſt noble is Agarick, which is white, ſpungy, ſweetiſh in taſt, eſpecially that which grows upon the Larch-Tree. It is very wel
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:35070:94"/>known to Phyſitians, for purging cold and flegmatick humors. Touch-wood,
<note place="margin">Touch-wood.</note> wel known for its uſe as tinder in ſtriking fire, doth alſo grow on Trees. St. <hi>Maries</hi> Bal ſo called, or <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyonium,</hi> is a kind of Toad-ſtool, alſo the Seaſpunge.</p>

                     <p>Moreover amongſt the Rudiments of Plants are alſo the Moſſes and certain moſſie herbs: amongſt the which notwithſtanding ſome perfect Herbs are reckoned.

The Apothecaries cal it <hi>Hepatica,</hi> others cal it <hi>Hepatica Petraea,</hi> Stone Liver-wort, becauſe it is good againſt inflamations of the Liver and Feavers proceeding from Choler. For it is cold and dry and a little aſtringent; whence it ſtops bleeding, and reſiſts inflamations of the mouth. V. Sea-Moſs, of which there are many ſorts. VI.
<note place="margin">Corallina.</note> 
                        <hi>Corallina</hi> which is alſo a Sea-Moſs, having a drying and aſtringent faculty, and kils Worms and drives them out the ſame day, to admiration. VII. <hi>Fucus Marinus,</hi> Seaweed: of which there are alſo ſome kinds; among which is the Sea-Oak ſo called. VIII.
<note place="margin">Maiden-hair.</note> Hither may be referred the common Maiden-hair of the Shops, becauſe of the likneſs it hath in its ſtalks to capillary Moſſes: appropriated chiefly to the Breaſt and Lungs, whoſe groſs humors it extenuates: alſo it breaks the Stone.

                     <p>The fourth Tribe contains Reeds and reedy Plants. <hi>Arundo,</hi> a Reed, which the Greeks cal <hi>Calamos,</hi> contains many ſorts. For there is in the firſt place the vulgar ſmal reed, which is cal'd <hi>Phragmites,</hi> good to tharch Houſes and to fence Gardens; after that is the ſolid or ful Reed, which is not hollow, called <hi>Naſtos,</hi> of which Darts are made. There is alſo the pipe Reed, the <hi>Donax</hi> or <hi>Cyprian</hi> Reed, the broad-leav'd Indian Reed or Cane. Alſo to the family of Reeds belongs the Water Cats-tail.</p>
                     <p>Among Reeds the moſt excellent are the <hi>Calamus aromaticus</hi> or ſpicy Reed,
<note place="margin">Calamus Aromati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus.</note> and the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Cane. For though at this day Apothecaries uſe the root of the Tree <hi>Acorus</hi> in ſtead of <hi>Calamus aromaticus:</hi> yet that is not the <hi>Calamus</hi> of the Ancients, which was not a Root, but a reedy hollow Cane in <hi>Syria</hi> neer <hi>Mount Lebanon,</hi> and in <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>India;</hi> Which Reed though hitherto it hath been almoſt out of knowledg; yet it is now come to light again; and is every where to be had at the Apothecaries. It heats and dries, is gently aſtringent, a little biting, and by tenuity of its parts opens the paſſages of the Body, moves the Courſes, and refreſhes the ſpirits.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, The Sugar Reed, or Sugar-Cane, is ſpungy and ful of pith,

                     <p>To this Tribe may be referred the ſeveral ſorts of Flower de-luce, which differ chiefly in the colour of the flowers, and have their name from the Rain-bow which they repreſent in their partly-coloured flowers. There are two ſorts eſpecially now in uſe; the one is the vulgar which hath a blew flower, whoſe Root, eſpecially the juyce preſſed thereout, doth powerfully purge the water from ſuch as have the Dropſie. To which belongs the ſmal thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leav'd Flower-de-luce, alſo the Chamaeiris or ground Flower-deluce. The other hath a white Flower &amp; Root which ſmels like a Violet, and therfore the Germans cal it <hi>Viol-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel</hi> or Violet Root: it hath a ſpicy faculty, heats and extenuates, and is good for the Heart and Brain, but eſpecially for Cheſt. There are alſo the <hi>Dalmatian, Chalcedonian,</hi> double flowred, and <hi>Portugal</hi> Flowers-de-luces &amp;c.

<note place="margin">Cyperus.</note> Now the roots of Cyperus do heat and dry, and are a little aſtringent, and therefore good to bring moiſt Ulcers to a Scar: Alſo they have a cutting fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and therefore are good for ſuch as have the Stone, cannot Piſs freely, and want their monthly Courſes. Alſo Galangal the greater and leſſer ſort, which heats, and helps al cold Diſeaſes cauſed by flegm, diſcuſſes Wind, and helps the Cholick. But the ſmaller ſort is more effectual than the other.

<note place="margin">Tormentil.</note> the Root whereof reſiſts putrefaction, is good againſt the plague, and moves ſweat; it ſtops the bellies looſneſs, flux of blood, and the Courſes. Alſo 'tis good for ſuch as are fallen from on high, and who are ſuſpected to have received ſome inward hurt.

                     </head>
                     <p>There are many ſorts of Trees, but not ſo many as of Herbs. There are many kinds of vulgar Apple-trees; alſo which more belong to this place, there is the Citron tree, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Tree, the Orange Tree, the Pomegranate Tree, the Quince Tree, the Peach Tree, the Apticock Tree, the Almond tree, the Pear Tree, of which again there are many kinds; the Prune and Plum tree, the Cherry tree, the Mulberry tree, the Fig tree, the Medlar tree, the Cornel tree, the Service tree, the Jujubee tree, the Cheſtnut tree, the Walnut tree, the Hazel tree, the Piſtachio Nut tree, the Bladder Nut tree, the Palm tree, the Olive tree, the Bay tree, the Roſe tree, the Juniper tree, the Oak, the Holm, the Cork tree, the Beech tree, the Aſh tree, the Alder tree, the Cedar tree, the wild Aſh tree, the Poplar, the Elm, the Linden, the Bitch, the Willow, the Elder, the Lote, the Savine, the Cypreſs tree, the Tree of Life, the Eugh tree, the Pine tree, the Pitch tree, the Fir tree, the Larch tree, the Turpentine tree, the Lentiſch tree.</p>
                     <p>And thus you have a Catalogue of the chief Plants, which I have therefore ſet down, both that al men, but eſpecially our idle Diſputers (who alwaies ſtick in the ſame general matter, and yet think themſelves rare Naturaliſts) may ſee by the example of Plants how great the amplitude of Nature is, and how that which we know is the leaſt part of what we are ignorant of: alſo that ſuch as are ſtudious of the knowledg of Plants might have occaſion to conſider how there may be a Method in Herbariſm, and how al Plants may be reduced to ſome certain Tribes: Which though I have not here finiſhed and brought to perfection, yet I have laid the Foundation. And not to ſpeak now of others; <hi>Andreas Caeſalpinus</hi> in his Sixteen Books of Plants, undertakes a laborious Method: For after in the firſt place he hath explained Trees and Shrubs; he propounds the variety of Herbs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the difference of their Seeds. And in the firſt place he deſcribes ſuch as bear ſingle ſeeds under every Flower, or have a ſingle receptacle of ſeeds: Secondly, ſuch as contain two ſeeds or receptacles of ſeeds, under the ſame flower: Thirdly, ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain four, or more: And at laſt ſuch as have no ſeed.</p>
                     <p>But though this diſtinction of Plants ſeems to be laborious and curious enough, and is therefore commended by ſome, yet I ſee not what Foundation it hath; ſeeing thoſe Plants are joyned in one and the ſame Tribe, by reaſon of the agreement of their ſeeds, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther agree in any ſignature, nor any other waies. As for example ſake, in the fourth Book, what agreement is there betwixt Valerian and <hi>Spica celtica,</hi> Hemp, Hops, Beets, Wheat and other Corns? In the Fifth Book, how do Cowcumbers and Gourds agree with Dwarf-Elder, Nightſhade, Indian Pepper, Lilly Convalley? In the Sixt Book, what argeement is betwixt Roſe Campion, wild Turnep, Twopenny graſs, and Purſlane? And the ſame may be ſaid of the reſt.</p>
                     <p>But I leave it free for any Body to change and perfect this Method as he pleaſes. For I am not ignorant that ſeveral men have ſeveral aims in their Methods of Plants. Phyſitians rank them according to their faculties and uſe in Phyſick. Natural Philoſophers have others conſiderations; ſome this, and ſome that.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the Vegetative Faculty is common to all Living things; ſo in all Living Creatures there is Senſe, which is common both to Man and Beaſt. <hi>By the faculty of Senſe Animals are diſtinguiſhed from Non-animals,</hi> as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath it <hi>de Juvent. &amp; ſenect. cap.</hi> 1. and <hi>de ſenſ. et ſenſil. cap.</hi> 1. Wherefore having treated of Souls in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and of the Vegetative or growing Soul, and of Plants; we now come to the Senſitive Soul, and to treat of Living Creatures.</p>
                  <p>And here in the firſt place,
<note place="margin">The ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſoul is not the ſpecifick form of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny beaſt:</note> as we did before concerning Plants, ſo we muſt ſignifie, That the Senſitive Soul is not the form of any Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, though void of reaſon; nor is a Horſe a Horſe by vertue of its principle of ſenſe; for ſo a Pike-fiſh ſhould be an Horſe, nor would a Lyon differ from a Dog. Yet is it moſt manifeſt, that theſe Animals differ in their forms, and in their ſpecifical operations depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereupon. But what thoſe ſpecifick forms are, is not eaſie to tel, but they are known by their ſpecifical actions.
<note place="margin">Bruits are not ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal:</note> And though many bruit Beaſts perform wonderful actions by their ſpecifick forms; yet are they not ſuch as that we ſhould therefore hold them to be Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, and to partake of underſtanding. For as <hi>Scaliger, Exercitat.</hi> 317. <hi>ſ.</hi> 5. rightly proves, No living Creature (except Man) performs actions properly Rational. And the holy Scripture attributes Reaſon to Man alone, as being created after the Image of God, <hi>Ecclus</hi> 17. ver. 16, 17, 18. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 32. ver. 9.</p>
                  <p>But that we may treat of the Senſitive Soul in general;
<note place="margin">The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſoul:</note> there are three faculties thereof; <hi>the knowing, deſiring, and moving faculty.</hi> The knowing comprehends the external and internal ſenſes ſo called: Appetite follows knowledg: finally to the thing known the living Creature moves. And ſeeing the knowing faculty goes before the reſt, in the firſt place we muſt treat thereof, and for the ſame cauſe we muſt firſt ſpeak of the external Senſes. And here you muſt obſerve,
<note place="margin">The word ſenſe taken two waies</note> that the word Senſe is taken two waies; ſomtimes for the Soul it ſelf, or its Faculty; ſomtimes for the operation which proceeds from the Senſitive Soul, and is called Senſation.</p>
                  <p>Now to the performance of Senſe theſe four things muſt neceſſarily concur. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Senſitive Soul: <hi>Secondly,</hi> the Organ: <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the Object: And <hi>Fourthly,</hi> the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium, which comes between the Organ and the Object. For in the <hi>firſt place.</hi> Although Senſation is attributed to the whol Animal, Soul and Body; yet the ſenſitive Soul is the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Efficient thereof, and the body is ſenſitive by means of the ſoul, which is the ſenſator or perceiver of things by the ſenſes. For it is the <hi>Entelecheia</hi> or act by which a ſenſible Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Body perceives things without it ſelf. And therefore a dead body void of a ſenſitive ſoul hath no longer the uſe of ſenſe. Now the ſecondary Efficient is the Inſtruments of Senſe, which are alſo neceſſarily required to ſenſation. For although the ſoul be eſſential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſent in the whol body; yet is it no where the Author of any ſenſe, where it hath no Organ: and although the ſame Eſſence of the Soul which is in the Eye, be alſo in the Foot; yet becauſe in the Foot there are no Inſtruments either of ſeeing or of hearing, in the Foot it neither ſees nor hears.</p>
                  <pb n="369" facs="tcp:35070:101"/>
                  <p> Now the Inſtruments of Senſe (to uſe the words of <hi>Scaliger,</hi> Exercitat. 297. Sect. 3.)
<note place="margin">The Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of the ſenſes:</note> are two: The Spirits which have moſt affinity to the Faculty; and the Members which have moſt affinity to the ſenſible Object. For the Spirits are ſo ſubtile, that they may be almoſt reputed immaterial. They receive the imprinted ſpecies or repreſentations of Objects. But the Inſtruments are the conveighers of the Spirits. And although the Organs of the Senſes conſiſt of many parts; yet one above the reſt is the chief Inſtrument of Senſation: which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> alſo tels us in theſe words, 2 <hi>de part. animal. cap.</hi> 1. <hi>All ſenſe is cauſed by means of the ſimilar parts, becauſe every ſenſe is of ſome one certain kind of thing, and each ſenſitive part is accounted capable of ſome one ſenſitive kind of things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Object is that which is perceived by the Senſe, viz. The ſenſible qualities.
<note place="margin">the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</note> For although the Objects of the Senſes are ſaid to be ſingular or ſeveral things, and corporeal ſubſtances; yet ſubſtances are not perceived by the ſenſe, as they are ſubſtances, but as they are endued with ſenſible qualities, and contain in them the formal Nature of a ſenſible Object. For <hi>Peter</hi> (for examples ſake) is ſeen as he is colored; is felt as he is hot, cold, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now a ſenſible Object is twofold; of it ſelf, and by accident. That is ſenſible of it ſelf,
<note place="margin">Senſible object twofold;</note> which primarily affects the ſenſe, without the intervention of any other thing, as color is perceived by the ſight primarily and of it ſelf. But that is accidentally ſenſible, which is not perceived of it ſelf, but by help of ſome other thing wherewith it is joyned and coupled. For example ſake, when we ſay, I ſee a ſweet thing, meaning Milk: the whiteneſs of the Milk is ſeen only of it ſelf, which is the proper object of the Eye; but the ſweetneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe joyned with that whiteneſs, is ſaid to be ſeen.</p>
                  <p>A thing ſenſible of it ſelf, is again twofold; Proper and Common. The Proper is that which can be perceived by one ſenſe, and no other; and concerning which no Error can be committed, as color by the ſight, ſound by the hearing, &amp;c. But the Common is that which is not proper to one ſenſe, but common to divers. And theſe are five: Magnitude, Figure, Number, Motion, Reſt; as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> reckons them 2. <hi>de Animal. cap.</hi> 6. <hi>text.</hi> 64. And to theſe general Heads may al thoſe be referred, which others reckon up; as neerneſs and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which <hi>Scaliger</hi> in <hi>Exercit.</hi> 66. makes a ſixt common ſenſible thing; Scituation, Continuity, Separation, Roughneſs, and Smoothneſs, and others which are wont to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned.</p>
                  <p>Now which way the common ſenſibles do affect the ſenſes, is controverted amongſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, while ſome ſay that peculiar ſpecies are by them imprinted upon the Senſes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers deny it. But their Opinion is neerer the truth, who hold, That the common Senſibles do preſent no peculiar ſpecies or repreſentations to the ſenſes; but only determine the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies or repreſentations of the proper ſenſibles, and add to them a peculiar manner. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Senſitive Qualities are not perceived ſeparated from their ſubjects, but together with them, the proper enters the ſenſe with the common by one ſimple ſpecies or repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet ſomwhat qualified: and color appears after one faſhion in a ſquare Body, after another faſhion in a round. But if the common ſenſibles ſhould ſend forth proper ſpecies, they ſhould alſo do it without the proper ones. But that they do not do, which appears in tranſparent things, as the Air, whoſe figure we do not perceive by its color which is none at al, but by the containing body, rather by imagination than by ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>Yet we do not ſay that the common ſenſible objects are perceived by accident, but by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſecondarily. For there are three things which belong to a ſenſible by accident, which do not belong to a common ſenſible. Firſt, a ſenſible by accident acts nothing upon the outward ſenſe, whereby it is ſaid to be accidentally diſcerned, but is only joyned with that which of it ſelf affects the ſenſe. Again, a ſenſible thing by accident may be perceived of it ſelf, by ſome peculiar faculty in the Perceiver, whether it be ſome external or internal ſenſe, or the underſtanding. Finally, it may eaſily be perceived by its proper power.</p>
                  <p>Now ſeeing al action is performed by mutual touch, and the ſenſible object is many times far diſtant from the Organ of ſenſe; the Queſtion is, how the object affects the ſenſe. Herein al ſound Philoſophers agree, That ſome quality is ſent out of the object unto the ſenſe. Now qualities are twofold, ſome real or material, others ſpiritual or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentional; as was ſaid before in <hi>Book</hi> 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 2. and the ſpiritual are nothing but Pictures and Images of the ſenſible objects, flowing from them, pure, thin, and free from the concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of matter; and that there are ſuch ſpiritual qualities experience it ſelf doth teach us. For in the Summer time, we ſee the cloaths of ſuch as lie under a Tree painted green with the color of the Tree; and a cloth held beſide a Glaſs ful of Claret, appears red; and other
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:35070:102"/>examples <hi>Scaliger</hi> brings, <hi>Exercit.</hi> 80. <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. and <hi>Exercit.</hi> 298. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. And in general the ſame thing is taught by artificial Glaſſes, which receive the Images even of things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote. And the ſame is apparent alſo as to other ſenſes. And that the Nature of ſenſible ſpiritual ſpecies or repreſentations is quite different from that of material repreſentations, <hi>Leo Hebraeus</hi> ſhews in his <hi>Dialogue de Amore, Lib.</hi> 3. by many reaſons. The firſt is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe al other qualities diffuſe themſelves ſucceſſively and by degrees through their ſubject, but light penetrates ſuddenly and in a moment through a tranſparent body. Secondly, a quality when it comes changes the natural diſpoſition of the ſubject; but Light makes no alteration in the tranſparent body, ſave that it enlightens the ſame. Thirdly, other qualites do not extend themſelves through an infinite ſpace, but light does. Fourthly, that though the efficient cauſe of other qualities be removed, yet there remains ſome impreſſion upon the ſubject; but the Illuminator being removed, there is no light remaining. Fiftly, other qualities are moved with their ſubject; but Light is not moved when the Air or Water is moved. Sixtly, many qualities of the ſame ſort in one ſubject are joyned and mixed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; but many Lights are not jumbled nor confounded, but two Candles make two ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, three make three ſhadows, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Queſtion therefore in this place is,
<note place="margin">Whether al the ſenſes do receive only ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of things?</note> 
                     <hi>Whether all the Senſes receive ſpiritual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of things.</hi> Some indeed have been of opinion, that ſpiritual repreſentations are not neceſſary in al the Senſes, but only in the ſight; and that al the other ſenſes are wrought upon by material qualities iſſuing from their objects. But this opinion is falſe, and al the ſenſes are wrought upon by their objects with ſpiritual ſpecies or repreſentations. And ſeeing of al the ſenſes feeling is moſt terreſtrial and moſt drowned in matter, and its object ſeems to have moſt aſſinity with material qualities, if we ſhal prove that this ſenſe is not wrought upon by real but ſpiritual qualities, the ſame wil be proved of al the reſt. But heat according to their opinion, acts upon the touch materially; and therefore produces another heat therein; which nevertheleſs is falſe. For al the ſenſes are ſaid to perceive the ſame numerical object whereby they are affected; which obſervation is true in ſpiritual qualities. For although an accident or real object does alſo differ from a ſpiritual, numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, if it be conſidered in it ſelf and according to its own Nature; yet as being the image thereof it reſembles and repreſents the ſame, it may be termed the ſame numerically; and the ſenſe perceiving the ſpiritual image of a thing, is ſaid to perceive the thing it ſelf; but not ſo, if it perceive a like real quality produced thereby. So he that hath ſeen the image of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> is ſaid to have ſeen <hi>Aeneas:</hi> but he that hath ſeen <hi>Aſcanius</hi> his Son, is never ſaid to have ſeen <hi>Aeneas.</hi> The ſame appears from the difference betwixt a material and ſpiritual quality. For ſince the action of the firſt qualities is true motion, and is performed in time, and ſeldom produces in the Patient a quality anſwering in degrees to its own vertue, by reaſon of the reſiſtency of contrary qualities; it would follow that ſenſe ſhould be performed in time and leiſurely: alſo that the ſenſe ſhould ſeldom perceive the true degree of its object, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly a leſſer. But ſeeing it is not thus in ſenſe, we muſt hold that only ſpiritual ſpecies or repreſentations, which have no contrary, are perceived by ſenſe: which opinion alſo <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> profeſſes to hold in 2. <hi>de Anima, chap.</hi> 12. <hi>text.</hi> 121. Which alſo is exceeding manifeſt in moſt of the tangible qualities, which if they ſhould act materially upon the touch, they ſhould produce therein a real quality like themſelves, and the organ of feeling ſhould become hard by feeling an hard thing, ſoft by feeling a ſoft thing: whereas theſe qualities have no ſuch activity; and no ſuch thing is found, either in the Feeling, or any other ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs you muſt here obſerve, that indeed al ſenſible ſpecies or repreſentations of objects are qualities not material but ſpiritual, and Images or Pictures of the ſenſible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects flowing from them, as was ſaid in the <hi>place before alleadged;</hi> and that nevertheleſs there are ſome differences of them, and that ſome are drowned in the matter and cannot get out, others diffuſe themſelves far from the Body from which they ariſe, being tied to no matter. The loweſt of the Senſes is feeling, whoſe object does no where raiſe it ſelf out of the matter, but being hid in the matter offers it ſelf to the ſenſe. So that nothing is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the touch, but what immediately touches the ſenſible body. And juſt ſo it is with taſts, which never affect the ſenſe of taſting at a diſtance; but whatever affects the taſt muſt immediately touch and affect the tongue. But the viſible ſpecies or Images of things, imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating the moſt noble Nature of Light, are free from matter, and at far diſtances are carried to the ſight and affect the ſame, no body coming between wherein they adhere. After the ſame manner <hi>Sound</hi> is diffuſed to a long diſtance, and penetrates not only the Air, but alſo Mettals, eſpecially thoſe that are leſs ſolid. Betwixt theſe ſpecies or images, viz. The
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:35070:102"/>tangible, taſts, and viſible repreſentations, ſmels are as it were of a middle nature. For they for the moſt part, though they are not brought to the organ of ſmelling without a ſubject, as the viſible ſpecies are brought to their organ; yet is there no neceſſity that the thing ſmelt ſhould be wholly applied to the noſtrils, but ſmelling things do ſend forth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain vapors, which are not themſelves odors properly to ſpeak (though ſome Phyſitians do ſo think) but the odours are in them; nor can the ſpecies or repreſentations of ſmels be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried without them, into diſtant Places.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now as touching the original of the ſenſible repreſentations,</hi> we need not vex our ſelves,
<note place="margin">The origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</note> nor introduce any agent ſenſe, to form ſenſible ſpecies out of the objects. Such is the nature of qualities properly ſenſible, and this power they have, That they can multiply themſelves by ſending forth their Images; and al forms can multiply themſelves, ſome both really and ſpiritually, ſome ſpiritually only. And if any ſhal ask, What way they do it? We can anſwer him no more than if he ſhould ask us how or why Fire heats.
<note place="margin">The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums of the ſenſes.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Alſo a Medium is neceſſary to Senſation. For ſeeing the ſenſes are only virtually affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the object, a Medium muſt needs come betwixt: which alſo <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> affirms, 2 <hi>de Anima, cap.</hi> 11. <hi>text.</hi> 114. <hi>We perceive all ſenſible objects through ſome Medium:</hi> And in 2. <hi>de Anim. cap.</hi> 9. <hi>t.</hi> 98. <hi>It is common to all, that a thing laid upon the Organ of Senſe cannot be diſcerned.</hi> And al theſe things muſt concur, if Senſation be made, and that right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſed to; whereof if one be abſent, or be not rightly diſpoſed, the Senſation either ceaſes or is vitiated.</p>
                  <p>Now wherein the Nature of Senſation conſiſts, Authors vary; nor is the Controverſie ſmal, <hi>Whether Senſation be meerly a Paſſion,</hi> and nothing but the reception of the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of ſenſible things? Or whether beſides the reception of the ſpecies there is any other action of the Soul concurring thereto? I ſpare to relate al the Opinions of others, which are at large by Authors related and confuted; only I ſhal ſet down that which ſeems to me moſt true, and this it is: The ſenſible ſpecies, or the object which ſends forth the ſenſible ſpecies, is not the agent or active principle of Senſation: for Senſation is the work of the Soul, and that an immanent work, not can be attributed to any external thing, eſpecially an accident; but it offers and repreſents to the ſenſe the thing ſenſible as the immediate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Nor is Senſation only Reception; which beſides other things, is hereby apparent, in that very often, when the ſenſible ſpecies is received in the organ, there is nevertheleſs no ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, becauſe the ſoul intent upon other things does not diſcern the ſenſible appearances: but Senſation is alſo a kind of Action. For Action which is more noble and worthy than Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is not to be denied to the ſenſitive faculty, ſince it belongs to the vegetative faculty, and to Accidents.</p>
                  <p>Yet we are not to hold two Senſes, one active, another paſſive, really diſtinct:
<note place="margin">Whether there is an active and a paſſive ſenſe?</note> but the ſame Soul is ſaid to act and ſuffer in a different reſpect. For the Soul inaſmuch as it judges and takes cognizance, is ſo far ſaid to act; but inaſmuch as the ſpecies is received in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, ſo far the Soul alſo it ſelf, which is in the organ and informs the ſame, is ſaid to ſuffer. Wherefore to receive the ſenſible ſpecies belongs to the Organ; to judg thereof when recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved belongs to the Soul: yet becauſe the Soul gives the Organ power to receive the ſpecies,
<note place="margin">the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation:</note> and is it ſelf the cauſe of Reception, Paſſion is alſo aſcribed thereunto. Senſation is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thus made: Spiritual Repreſentations produced by a material object, are received in an animated Organ: being ſo received the Soul takes cognizance of them and judges of them, and ſo is ſaid to be ſenſible: finally, the Action is received in the Organ, and communicated to the whol.</p>
                  <p>One thing remains yet to be explained, what credit is to be given to the ſenſes,
<note place="margin">Whether the ſenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject?</note> and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they may err about their proper objects. The Epicureans did attribute ſo much to the Senſes, that they thought we could never be deceived, and held that al which we learn is to be meaſured by the Rules of the Senſes, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith in his Book <hi>de Civitate Dei, B.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. Whence <hi>Lucretius</hi> in his Fifth Book, conceives that the Sun and Moon, are no bigger than they appear to us. Contrariwiſe, the Academicks wil give no credit at al to the Senſes. That we may know what to think in this point, we muſt obſerve theſe things following: The ſenſe may err three manner of waies: Firſt about the kind or common nature of its object, as taking color for ſound, ſound for ſmel. Secondly, in the ſort and particular na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the object, as to take white for black, bitter for ſweet. Thirdly, in its application to the object; when it ſo apprehends ſome ſenſible thing, as if it had in it ſome quality which it hath not indeed; as when the taſt judgeth meat to be bitter, which is not ſo indeed, but ſeems ſo, by reaſon of the bitterneſs of choler, wherewith the tongue is infected.</p>
                  <p>Hence therefore thus we conclude the matter: The Senſe cannot err about its object, after
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:35070:103"/>the firſt manner: for the ſight never miſtakes Sound for Colour, nor the Ear Smel for Sound: but concerning the common ſenſibles it may be thus deceived: for it often takes that which is moved to ſtand ſtil; and that which is divided into many parts it often judges to be one continued thing. But in the ſecond manner it is not impoſſible for the ſenſe to be deceived; and that which is blew ſeems many times far off to be black. Finally, in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication both of the common and proper Objects it is deceived: ſo a white thing ſending its appearance through a red Glaſs, is thought to be red alſo: for then the ſight errs not in the colour, but in the application thereof to a wrong ſubject; and ſo it is when the Sun is ſeen through a red Cloud; for it attributes the redneſs which is in the Cloud unto the Sun. And therefore concerning its proper object, the ſenſe can be deceived only theſe two latter waies; about the common object all three waies. Howbeit theſe errors may be avoided, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the proper objects, if theſe conditions be obſerved. Firſt, That the Organ be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſtituted, and there be no fault therein. Secondly, That the medium be fitly diſpoſed, and infected with no ſtrange quality. Finally, That that be a fit diſtance betwixt the Object and the Organ.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Now Sight is an external Senſe,
<note place="margin">Its defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition.</note> perceiving and diſcerning the repreſentations of things viſible.</hi> And Viſion or Seeing, is the apprehenſion of viſible things by the Soul ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing its ſenſitive faculty in the Eye.
<note place="margin">The Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan of ſight</note> The Organ of ſeeing is the <hi>Eye,</hi> receiving the viſible ſpecies or ſhews of things like a Looking-Glaſs: Hence is that common ſaying that <hi>the Eye is the Looking-Glaſs of nature,</hi> and that a Looking-Glaſs is the Eye of Art, as <hi>Coelius Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diginus</hi> hath it in <hi>Ant. Lect. Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 28. But the chief part of the Organ is the Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalline humor, for the ſake whereof the other parts of the Eye were by nature or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained.</p>
                  <p>The Object of Sight,
<note place="margin">Its Object.</note> is that which is viſible. Now what that is, we are to conſider. Now although many things are ſaid to be ſeen; yet as to the proper object of ſight, the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie ſeems to be chiefly of Light and Color: For the beſt Philoſophers do ſomtimes ſay, that Light is the firſt thing viſible and that which is viſible of it ſelf: and ſomtimes again, they ſay the proper and adequate object of the ſight is Color, and that all viſible things are coloured. Howbeit theſe two Opinions are not contrary, but if they be rightly explained they include the true opinion concerning the Object of Sight: For indeed the adequate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of ſight is colour, and whatſoever is ſeen under the notion of colour; and therefore light it ſelf inaſmuch as it is ſaid to be ſeen, is comprehended under colour, and is as it were a whiteneſs. Howbeit, you muſt obſerve, it is one thing to be viſible, another to be actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeen. All colour is of its own nature actually viſible, nor doth it receive its viſibility from any external Cauſe; and though it ſhould never be ſeen, yet were it viſible of its own nature, ſaies <hi>Scaliger, Exercit.</hi> 325. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. and that colour which is in the dark, and deep within a thing, is actually colour, yet light is required that it may be actually ſeen.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> defines colour,
<note place="margin">What Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour is.</note> in his <hi>B. De ſenſ. &amp; ſenſibl. cap.</hi> 3. <hi>The extremity of that which is tranſparent in a terminated body,</hi> or <hi>the Extremity of a tranſparent thing termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated:</hi> which definition that it may be rightly underſtood, it is to be obſerved, that colour belongs to al things by means of perſpicuity, and that tranſparency terminated is the Subject of colours. For tranſparency being condenſed, ſo that it can be no longer ſeen thorough, nor tranſmit the Images of other things, becomes coloured, and is ſaid to be terminated: for it preſcribes bounds and limits to the Sight, and is an hinderance that other things cannot be ſeen which lie betwixt it and the ſight; for although that ſame colour alſo which is in the middle and depth of a thing, is alſo colour: yet he ſeems rather to have defined that which
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:35070:103"/>is actually ſeen, and is in the Surface. For Colour is not the Surface as ſome ill expound <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle,</hi> but in the Surface: and the extremity of a body as a body is one thing, and the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of a diaphanous or tranſparent body conſidered as ſuch is another. Now the term or bound of a Diaphanous or tranſparent body is where it becomes dark.</p>
                  <p>Colour therfore hath its Original from the termination of that which is tranſparent: And that is two waies; firſt only by condenſation of the tranſparent body, without the admixture of another body, after which manner the Stars come to be ſeen. Again Colour is made by the mixture of a dark body with a tranſparent. So Fire which is of it ſelf tranſparent, if it be mixed with exhalations and fumes, appears of a red colour; and the ſame comes to paſs in the Air and Water: for theſe three Elements are tranſparent, though in a various degree; for Fire is moſt of al tranſparent; after that the Air; Water ſeems to have ſome darkneſs in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon; but the Earth is abſolutely dark. And therefore by the mixture of the earthy parts with the other Elements ſundry colours ariſe. But in the firſt place, that which is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent becomes white; and therfore that which is tranſparent, light, and whiteneſs, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of the ſame nature: in like manner, Intranſparency, Darkneſs, and Blackneſs are alſo of kin. And theſe are the firſt, ſimple and extream colours, which do alſo proceed from the firſt ſimple Bodies, and all other colours conſiſt of a mixture of theſe; al the ſorts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to reckon up in this place would be too tedious; touching which <hi>Scaliger</hi> hath many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things in his 325. <hi>Exercitation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now apparent colours are made of the Species of real colours mingled with others.
<note place="margin">Apparent Colours how made</note> And therefore when the Sun's light is mingled with the colour of Clouds, various colors do reſult therefrom. Therfore we conclude that colour is viſible, but that illuminated or ſhining co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour is only actually ſeen.</p>
                  <p>Whence alſo a Cauſe may be rendred why ſome things are not only ſeen themſelves, but make others to be ſeen; and ſome things can be ſeen themſelves, but cannot make other things to be ſeen: and others again can neither be ſeen themſelves, nor make others to be ſeen. For ſome things have an inbred light proper to themſelves; ſome only an adventitious or borrowed light. Such as have an inbred light can be ſeen without the help of other things. And ſuch as have it plentiful and potent, as the Sun and Fire, do alſo make other things viſible; but ſuch as have little light in them, and ſo little as can only render them viſible, and that but in the Night, do not at al help other things to be ſeen; ſuch as are ſome rotten woods, Glow-Worms, and ſuch like: but thoſe things that have no innate light, can neither make other things viſible, nor are they viſible themſelves, unleſs they be enlightened by ſome other thing.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe Light is neceſſary to Sight, it is worth our enquiry how it concurs thereto.
<note place="margin">How light concurs to ſight.</note> Some hold, that it is only required to illuminate the object and medium, others that it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary alſo to inlighten the Organ. As to the object, it is altogether neceſſary that it be illuminated, that it may be actually ſeen; and that appears by experience. For although the whol Air which is about the Party ſeeing be illuminated, yet if that which is about the colour be not illuminated, the colour cannot be ſeen: for the colours of themſelves if they be not illuſtrated by light, do remain ſluggiſh as it were, ſo that they cannot produce an Image of themſelves; and light is the act of colour, not to make it to be, but to make it viſible, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaies, <hi>Exercit.</hi> 75. <hi>S.</hi> 7. Alſo for the Medium light is requiſite: yet is it not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that the whol be illuminated, but only that part which is about the thing viſible: and ſo light ſeems not neceſſary to the medium as a medium; but only in reſpect of the viſible object therein reſiding. For even when we are in the dark we ſee thoſe things that are in an illuminated Medium; and in the deepeſt wels, where no light reacheth, we ſee the Stars even in the day time.</p>
                  <p>As to the Organ, we avouch with <hi>Ariſtotle, de ſenſ. &amp; ſenſibil. Cap.</hi> 3. <hi>that as without, ſo within, there is no ſeeing without light:</hi> howbeit we hold that it is rather an inward and inbred than an external light, which the Eyes of many Creatures that ſhine in the night, do witneſs. But that an Eye which is in the thickeſt darkneſs can be illuminated and illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a light ſo weak, as to be able to inlighten things cloſe by it (as for example that which ſhines from rotten wood) is improbable: As alſo it ſeems impoſſible that a light and colour ſmal and weak, far diſtant from the Eye, can any waies inlighten the whole Air as far as to the Eye.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe that <hi>Light</hi> is altogether neceſſary to ſight, it is enquired,
<note place="margin">Whether Light it ſelf be ſeen</note> 
                     <hi>whether it alſo be ſeen.</hi> We anſwer: That Light while it is in a tranſparent medium is not ſeen, as that <hi>which,</hi> but as that <hi>wherewith;</hi> and that it is not ſeen of it ſelf, but <hi>by accident;</hi> becauſe it makes colours to be actually ſeen: and when we ſee colour, we judg that the Air is illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated.</p>
                  <pb n="374" facs="tcp:35070:104"/>
                  <p> But the Medium of Sight is that which is <hi>transparent;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of ſight.</note> and that which is ſeen is alwaies more darkſom than the Medium. Hence we ſee water in the Air, and the ſame thing co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lored is ſeen in pure cleer water, and hid in that which is troubled. And therefore a thing colored may alſo be the Medium of Sight, provided it be not quite dark, but more tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent than the viſible object. So we ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſmal creatures incloſed in Amber.</p>
                  <p>The Manner of Sight remains yet to be explained,
<note place="margin">Whether ſight be cauſed by receiving in, or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding forth.</note> concerning which there are no ſmal controverſies amongſt the Ancients. For though herein al conſent, That to cauſe ſight the object muſt of neceſſity be joyned to the organ; yet how that is done they are not al agreed. The Platoniſts (for as for <hi>Plato</hi> himſelf, ſome wil have him to be of one Opinion, and ſome of another; and <hi>Scaliger</hi> in <hi>Exercitat.</hi> 325. <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. cites places out of his <hi>Timaeus</hi> and <hi>Meno,</hi> whereby he endeavors to prove, That <hi>Plato</hi> conceived ſight to be cauſed by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies flowing from the Object to the Eye) very many skil'd in the Opticks, and al ancient Philoſophers in a manner until <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> held that the Optick ſpirits and raies went out of the Eye to the Object, and laid hold of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>But this Opinion is falſe and corrected by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> ſo that thoſe Ancients are not ſo much to be blamed, as they are to be chaſtiſed who contrary to the judgment of that wiſe Man, do ſtil follow thoſe toyes. For Sight as al other Senſes, is an immanent action, and therfore it muſt be performed in the Eyes, and not without. And ſeeing every agent which acts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another thing without it ſelf does not receive in it ſelf the end and fruit of its action (as the operation of heating is not received in the agent but the Patient) the fruit alſo of ſight if it were cauſed by ſending forth of raies, would be in the thing ſeen, and not in the Seer; which is abſurd. For the end of ſight in a Living Creature is the accommodation of its life: but in Man beſides that, alſo the knowledg of Nature, comprehenſion of God, and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Finally, What can that be, which out of ſo ſmal an Eye-bal can be ſent ſo ſuddenly to ſo many things as we behold, ſo diſtant? A corporeal ſubſtance, ſuch as are the Optick ſpirits, cannot be ſhed forth in ſo great plenty. For there is nothing that can ſuffice to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair ſo many ſpirits; nor can it be moved in an inſtant from the Eye ſo far as to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens: Nor can any quality of it ſelf perform the ſame; but if it ſhould do this, the ſoul muſt needs be in it. But the ſubject of the ſoul is a ſubſtance, not an accident. Yea, in general, whatever you hold goes forth and cauſes ſight, it muſt do it by means of the ſoul. Whence it would follow, that the Air hath in it not only one ſoul, but the ſouls of many li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creatures. And thoſe very arguments and many more which are brought by <hi>Zabarella Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Viſu, cap.</hi> 4.5. do make againſt that Opinion of <hi>Galen</hi> and others, who hold, That the ſight goes out a certain diſtance, and is united with the image of the viſible object, and that ſo ſight is cauſed.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore hold with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">the true manner of ſight.</note> That ſight is cauſed by the reception of viſible ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges into the Eyes; and that as from every point of a lightſom body into every point of a tranſparent Medium Light is propagated: ſo from every part of a colored body, an Image thereof is ſent into a tranſparent Medium, by a right line, and received into the Eye, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by the ſight. For even the images received do appear within the apple of the Eye; and an excellent viſible object hurts the ſight; and the Eye is made of ſo many parts, for this Receptions ſake.</p>

                     </note> for it (after Sight) is the moſt excellent Senſe, and ſeems to contend therewith in point of nobility. Now the Hearing is an external ſenſe, which by help of the Ear perceives audible things, viz. Sounds: for the object of Hearing is Sound. Now Sound is a quality ariſing from the Air or Water being ſmitten and broken by the vehement and ſudden concuſſion of ſolid bodies.</p>
                  <p>To the generation of Sound three Bodies are neceſſary:
<note place="margin">How ſound is generated.</note> two of which mutually ſtrike one another, or at leaſt one performing the office of two, in two parts. Now theſe bodies ought to be ſolid, that they may gather and condenſe the Air, and not having many pores. Hence Spunges, and locks or fardles of wool knockt together, do cauſe no ſound; becauſe being ful of many pores, the ſmitten Air is received by them, and ſo it is not broken. Beſides two ſolid bodies, a third thing is required, which may be intercepted betwixt thoſe two ſolid bodies and broken. And this is that which alſo Fiſhes hear.</p>
                  <p>The Mediums which receive ſound are the Air and the Water.
<note place="margin">the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of hearing.</note> They commonly hold, that a certain inbred air of the Ear is the chief organ of Hearing. Contrariwiſe other later
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:35070:104"/>Authors, ſince the Organ of a ſenſe ought to be a ſimilar part animated, do reject this Air: and hold the principal inſtrument of Hearing to be a certain Nerve ſpred out in the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r. And truly the former Opinion is not ſo allowable as this, unleſs it be explained as <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaccius</hi> explains it; who teaches, that as the innate heat of the Eye is luminous or light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; ſo the innate heat of the Ear is Aerial, ſo that it may be affected by ſound, and is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called, complanted Air, that is, Air bred in the Ear from the firſt formation; but that it is not included in any peculiar Cavity, but ingrafted and implanted in the expanded Nerve.</p>
                  <p>Here we muſt not paſs over the Eccho,
<note place="margin">How Eccho is cauſed.</note> which is a reciprocal and reflected ſound from a ſmooth and hollow place. For as Light and viſible Images lighting upon a ſmooth and poliſhed body are reflected: ſo ſounds, if they light on a ſmooth, even, and hollow body, whereon they are not broken, they are reflected. And as in general, that ſound may be heard, it is not neceſſary that al the air from the place where the ſound is firſt cauſed, ſhould be continually broken, as far as to the Ears; but it is enough if the image thereof be propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated ſo far; even ſo an Eccho is not bred by a new breaking of the Air, for ſo this reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal ſound would not be articulated: but only the image of the former ſound rebounding back to us. Nor may a word be only once reflected, but divers times, viz. If the voyce bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten back do light upon other hollow places, one after another. So the ſeven Cyzician To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers did multiply words received by them with a manifold Eccho. And <hi>Pliny</hi> relates, how in the Porch of <hi>Olympia,</hi> which they therefore termed <hi>Heptaphonon,</hi> the ſame word was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times repeated; <hi>Nat. Hiſt.

                     </note> which is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſenſe perceiving ſmels, by help of the Noſe or mamillary proceſſes therein. For the object thereof is a ſcent or ſavor.</p>
                  <p>Now touching the Nature of the Smel, the vulgar Doctrine is, that it is a quality ariſing in mixt bodies, from a dry ſavory thing by the Heat mingled with moiſture. For they ſay ſmel and taſt are ſo of kin, that al things which have taſt have alſo ſmel, and every thing that hath no taſt, hath no ſmel neither. Hence mixt things only have ſmels, and not the Elements, which alſo have no taſt: for neither have al mixt things ſmels, but thoſe only which have taſts. For ſtones have no ſmel, which are alſo void of taſt; but woods, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things which have taſts, have alſo ſmels. But herein nevertheleſs ſmels and taſts differ, in that drineſs prevails in ſmels, moiſture in taſts. Hence Nitre hath a ſtronger ſmel than Salt, and Salt is moiſter than Nitre; becauſe in Nitre there is more drineſs, in Salt more moiſture; and things that ſmel, if they are over moiſtened they looſe their ſmel. For the ſame cauſe, if after a drought the Rain fals, at firſt a certain ſmel is perceived; becauſe the dry is mingled with the moiſt: but the ſmel laſts only ſo long as until the drineſs overcomes the moiſture; but if the rain continue ſo long, that the drineſs is vanquiſhed by the Moiſture, the ſmel alſo ceaſes.</p>
                  <p>They hold the efficient cauſe of ſmels as of al works in mixt bodies to be heat,
<note place="margin">the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe of ſmel.</note> which in due meaſure and manner mixes the moiſt with the dry. And hence they give the cauſe why moſt things that have ſmel, ſmel ſtrongeſt when they are hot; why ſome things ſmel not at al unleſs they be heated; and why moſt things ſmel more in the day than in the night, in the Winter than in the Summer. For when in the mixt body moiſture does very much abound, or drineſs is not rightly mixed with the moiſture; there ariſes either no ſmel, or one which is imperfect. And that therefore there is need of heat, which may either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the overmuch moiſture, or mingle the ſame with the dry parts after a due man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                  <p>But ſeeing what <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaith of Taſts, <hi>Exercit.</hi> 279. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. That Taſt no more ariſes from the firſt Qualities than Laughter, is moſt true of ſmel: they labor in vain, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to draw ſmels from the firſt Qualities; ſince they are not in the power of the firſt Qualities, and we muſt have recourſe to nearer principles. And the Chymiſts do far more probably deduce odors from Sulphur, and hold that Sulphur is the prime ſubject of
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:35070:105"/>ſmels; of which we have ſpoke elſwhere in our Treatiſe of <hi>the Conſent and Diſſent of the Chymiſts with the Ariſtoteleans and the Galeniſts, chap.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p>The differences of Smels are little known;
<note place="margin">Differences of Odors.</note> but becauſe the Taſt and Smel are of kin, and moſt ſmels have much affinity to taſts, the names of taſts are alſo given to ſmels. Now the Taſts do follow the Nouriſhment, which is examined thereby by Creatures that eat the ſame; and therefore theſe ſavors of themſelves bring no pleaſure or diſpleaſure, but only by accident, as they are ſigns of good or bad nouriſhment. Hence the greaſie ſmel of roaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meat is delightful to the hungry. Theſe odours are exquiſitely perceived by Bruits, and therein they excel Man-kind.</p>
                  <p>Yet there is alſo another kind of ſmels which does not follow the Aliment, but is of it ſelf pleaſant or unpleaſant, as the ſmel of Spices and many other things. And with theſe ſmels, as alſo the beauty of colors, Men are either only or chiefly affected: and other Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creatures how exquiſitely ſoever they ſmel other ſcents, yet herein they are far out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone by Man-kind; ſo that either they take no delight from ſweet ſmels, or if they do, it is very imperfect and maimed, and agrees but to a few of them. Of which ſee <hi>Scaliger</hi> in <hi>Exercit.</hi> 303. <hi>S.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>From what hath been ſaid is not hard to judg what is the true object of ſmelling, and after what manner ſmels are perceived by the ſenſe of ſmelling. That Odours are the object of ſmelling was ſaid before, nor does any man deny it: but how that is to be underſtood, is not ſo manifeſt. <hi>Heraclitus</hi> (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaies) <hi>de ſenſ. &amp; ſenſibil. cap.</hi> 5. Many ancient Philoſophers, <hi>Galen</hi> and very many Phyſitians are of Opinion, That the ſenſe of ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is not only affected by ſome ſpiritual image and repreſentation, but that a certain corporeal, aerial, thin exhalation does flow out of ſmelling things, and is perceived by the ſenſe. Contrariwiſe, the greateſt part of Peripateticks are of opinion, that a naked image of the ſmel does ſpiritually flow from the odorous body, as an image from a thing viſible, and is carried to the organ of ſmel, and thereby perceived.</p>
                  <p>The latter Opinion ſeems truer to us,
<note place="margin">Odors are not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</note> provided it be rightly explained: yet that there is ſome truth in the former cannot be denied, though in ſome part it ſwerve from truth. For in the firſt place, this muſt of neceſſity be allowed, That odours are not ſubſtances, nor any thing corporeal: For the ſenſes do not perceive ſubſtances, but only their accidents. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, this alſo hath been ſhewn before; That no ſenſe is affected by a real or material qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<note place="margin">The ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives only an image.</note> but only by its repreſentation, or a ſpiritual and intentional quality as they cal it. And therefore we muſt alſo hold the ſame as to the ſenſe of ſmelling, that the ſaid ſenſe perceives nothing corporeal, nor yet any real quality, but only the Image thereof.</p>
                  <p>Nor muſt we in the next place deny that ſomwhat does flow from and exhale out of ſuch things as ſmel, and is carried in the Air. For dayly experience teaches, That odoriferous exhalations do ſundry waies affect the Brain, and very often change the temper thereof, and ſomtimes qualifie and rectifie the ſame, other whiles cauſe heavineſs of head, as <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> hath it in his 5. Sect. of Aphoriſms, Aph. 28. Yea, and this comes not to paſs in the Brain only, but many times by odorous exhalations we perceive our Noſtrils, Eyes, and Face to be gnawn as it were, and pained. Moreover, we ſee that odoriferous things by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little do for the moſt part waſt and conſume away. And when an odoriferous thing is taken away, the ſmel remains many times a long while after in the Air, which cannot be done by the images alone, which do not remain when the object is removed. Al which things teach, that oftentimes there flows from odorous bodies a certain corporeal exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which hath a power of heating, cooling, and doing other things, which cannot be effected by bare ſpecies and images. This therefore we grant, That from many things a certain odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riferous vapor exhales, and that corporeal ſavory vapors do flow from things that have ſmel: but yet we avouch that a ſpiritual ſpecies is required and preſuppoſed to cauſe the ſenſe of ſmelling.
<note place="margin">Whether the ſpecies of ſmel need al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies the carriage of a vapor.</note> But whether or no both are alwaies neceſſary, and whether the ſpecies of the Odor, which is properly perceived by the ſenſe of ſmelling, is alwaies joyned with ſome corporeal ſubject or vapor, without which it cannot be carried to the Organ of Smelling, is yet in doubt, and this is the main hinge of the Controverſie.</p>
                  <p>We have ſpoke before in <hi>cap.</hi> 1. of the difference of ſenſible ſpecies, and have granted that odours for the moſt part are indeed carried to the ſmel with a corporeal ſubſtance: but we deny that this is alwaies neceſſary, and hold that the exhalation which comes from the odorous body does not alwaies reach ſo far as to the Noſtrils, yea, and that ſomtimes no ſuch thing comes from the odorous body, and that the ſmelling is cauſed by ſpiritual quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and images, of the ſavors proceeding from the odoriferous body to the organ of ſmelling. For if that ſame vaporous exhalation ſhould be alwaies joyned with ſmels as their carrier,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:35070:105"/>Fiſhes could perceive no ſmels in the water, nor could be allured thereby to ſeek the Bait: For ſince the nature of odoriferous exhalations does conſiſt in a dry ſubject elaborated by heat, and the nature of exhalations is ſuch as to aſcend upwards, how ſhould thoſe exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations come to the bottom of the water? or if they ſhould come thither, how wil they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their drineſs and the integrity of their nature in the water, ſince odoriferous things when wet are wont to loſe their ſmel? Moreover, how can there be ſo great and ſo long an efflux of vapors from odoriferous things, as may ſuffice to fil moſt large ſpaces? The whol odoriferous things verily which are but ſmal many times, if they were al turned into vapors, could not fil ſuch diſtances. Yea, and we ſee many things do ſmel a very long time together, and yet are not at al conſumed or waſted.</p>
                  <p>From the Premiſes alſo that Queſtion may be explained;
<note place="margin">Whether Odours nouriſh?</note> Whether Odors can nouriſh a man? For ſeeing the nouriſhment of a body ought to be a body, and we are nouriſhed with the ſame things whereof we conſiſt; and odors are qualities; we hold that they have no power to nouriſh. And whereas it is ſaid that ſick perſons are many times refreſhed with ſmels, and that <hi>Democritus</hi> for his ſiſters ſake (whom he would not draw from the Feaſt of the Theſmophoriſt) did prolong his life three daies only by ſmelling to hot Bread; that muſt not be attributed to ſmels, but to odoriferous vapors exhaling from the Bread, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creating the ſpirits. Nor is that true nutrition which is made by appoſition of a like ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, viz. Of Blood elaborated in the Liver; but only a certain cheering of the Spirits.</p>
                  <p>As to the Organ of Smelling, though al agree herein,
<note place="margin">What is the Organ of the ſmell?</note> that the Noſtrils are the Inſtrument of ſmelling; yet it is controverted betwixt the Phyſitians and Peripateticks, what is the chief Organ of ſmelling. For the moſt Peripareticks do hold the proper Organ of Smelling to be the Nerves dilated in the Noſtrils. <hi>Galen</hi> holds ſmel to be produced in the foremoſt Ventricles of the Brain, in 8. <hi>de uſu partium, cap.</hi> 6. <hi>de olfactus Inſtrumentis, cap.</hi> 4. Other Phyſitians ſay, That from the Brain neer the Cavity of the Eyes, two Channels are derived to the bored bones of the Noſe, whoſe ends ſeem like teats (whence they are called the mammillary or teat-like productions) and that in them as the proper inſtrument odors are diſcerned. Which Opinion is moſt agreeable to truth, and the greateſt part of the beſt Phyſitians do follow the ſame. For the Brain is not the proper Organ of any external ſenſe, but the common, as ſupplying ſpirits into the organs of the external ſenſes, As to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils, true indeed it is, That odors are perceived by them alone, and that theſe are the only waies Nature hath appointed to carry ſmels to the Organ of Smelling: yet the perception and judgment of Odors is not in them, but in thoſe mammillary or Teat-like productions, which are placed before the Ventricles of the Brain, as the examiners of ſmels. For if we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute the faculty of perceiving Odors to the Noſtrils alone, and the Nerves in them dilated, what ſhould hinder us from ſmelling, ſo long as we have our Noſtrils? Yet Experience ſhews, That when thoſe proceſſes are obſtructed, as is wont to happen in the <hi>Coryza,</hi> the Smelling is either abated or quite taken away, without any fault in the Noſtrils. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, if Smelling were made in the Noſtrils, we ſhould perceive ſmels without breathing; whereas nevertheleſs we find by dayly experience, that the moſt odoriterous things being put to our Noſe, we ſmel nothing unleſs we draw our breath; the reaſon whereof is, becauſe thoſe mammillary proceſſes are placed within the Skul, ſo that ſmels cannot come thereto ſave by attraction of the Air.</p>
                  <p>The Medium through which Odors are diſcerned, is the Air and Water.
<note place="margin">The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of ſmelling.</note> As to the Air there is no doubt. But that in the Waters alſo ſmels are diſcerned by Fiſhes, this is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that Fiſhes are allured by the ſmel of Baits; which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> proves by many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, in his Book <hi>de Hiſtor. Animal. Lib</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. And ſo much may ſuffice to have ſaid of the Senſe of Smelling.</p>

For although the touch is ſomtimes generally taken for a ſenſitive power, which takes cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of an object, not removed but applied to the Organ (and in this manner the Taſt may be called a kind of feeling, and ſo it is by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in that ſence called.) for it does not perceive things diſtant as the ſight does colors, but only ſavors applied to the Tongue; yet
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:35070:106"/>that ſignification is not ſo proper; and the Queſtion is, whether the Touch be the ſame Senſe, with that power that perceives Tangible Objects: which is denied. For they differ both in the Object and Organ: for the Object of the touch is tangible Qualities, but of the Taſt Savors: and the taſt may be loſt in the Tongue, while the Senſe of Touching remains entire. And therefore their Organs are quite different; and though in the Tongue there be Touch, yet where ever there is Touch there is not Taſt; but only in the Tongue; whoſe thin ſoft and ſpungy fleſh, the like whereof is not in the whol Body, is the propes Inſtrument of Taſting.</p>
                  <p>The Object of Taſting is Savor. Touching the nature whereof, we paſs over the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the Ancients, <hi>Empedocles, Democritus, Leucippus,</hi> and <hi>Anaxagoras.</hi> The Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateticks do thus teach concerning Savor. No ſimple Body hath any ſavor of taſt, it being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an adjunct of mixt bodies, and thereto three things are requiſite: an earthy drineſs, a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try moiſture, and Heat which is the Author of all operations in mixt bodies: Of which we have every where frequent ſigns and tokens: For Water which of it ſelf is taſtleſs, if it be ſtrained through ſome earthy dry ſubſtance, it becomes ſavory, as appears in Fountains, which receive divers taſts from the parts of the Earth through which they flow: and the water of Lye is bitter, becauſe it is ſtrained through Aſhes. Howbeit the Nature of taſt conſiſts more in moiſt parts than in dry: and it is a quality affecting the taſt, ariſing in mixt bodies from the permiſtion of a watry moiſture with a dry earthineſs. And ſeeing the mixture of moiſture with drineſs is various; and the watry moiſturejoyned with earthy dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is the ſubject of Taſts is various, ſomtimes thicker, ſomtimes thinner, and the Heat which is the Cauſe of taſts is ſomtimes ſtronger, otherwhiles weaker, hence alſo ſundry taſts do ariſe which are ſeverally reckoned up,
<note place="margin">Kinds of taſts.</note> by ſeveral Men. Moſt do acknowledg chiefly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſimple taſts or ſavors; and from their commixture others may ariſe, or at leaſt they may be referred to them: Sweet, Sout, Harſh, Rough, Salt, Bitter, Biting. Theſe taſts may be conſidered two manner of waies, either in reſpect to the firſt Qualities Heat and Cold, or to the ſenſe of Taſting which they affect.</p>
                  <p>The former way they are chiefly conſidered by Phyſitians, and they ſerve them to know the Qualities of medicaments by, and are divided into Hot and Cold. Into three Cold, Sour, Harſh, Rough; three Hot in exceſs, the Biting, Salt, and bitter, and one moderately hot, <hi>viz.</hi> Sweet. And thus with Phyſitians the Harſh and Biting taſts are the extream taſts, the former the Coldeſt, the latter the Hotteſt of all others. The Philoſopher conſiders them rather after the latter manner, and takes not their difference from the tangible Qualities, but from the Effect whereby they work upon the taſt: and thus becauſe that taſt which is moſt contrary to ſweet is the bitter Taſt, and the one is moſt pleaſant, the other moſt unpleaſant: therefore theſe two are by Philoſophers counted the extream taſts, the reſt are interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate.</p>
                  <p>The ſweet Taſt therefore is moſt pleaſing to the Palat,
<note place="margin">Sweet taſt</note> ariſing from the mixture of a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try moiſture with an earthy drineſs, made commonly by a moderate heat. Such is in Bread, Milk, ripe Grapes, Figs, Licoris, Sugar, Honey. Although in theſe alſo ſome degrees may be obſerved in heat, for ſome are botter than other ſome; and thoſe that come neereſt a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocrity are moſt fit to nouriſh a man.</p>
                  <p>An acid ſharptaſt conſiſts in a matter thin and ſubtile,
<note place="margin">A tart taſt</note> and ariſes from a weak heat, or becauſe in the mixture there are many watry parts which cannot be overcome by the Heat, or becauſe out of the mixt body the hotteſt parts, eſpecially thoſe that are moſt pure, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Aery,
<note place="margin">An harſh taſt</note> are exhaled. Such a taſt is in Vinegar, Sorrel, Juyce of Lemons. An harſh taſt conſiſts in a matter indifferently thick, and ariſeth from a greater degree of cold, and a weaker heat than the Sour.
<note place="margin">A rough taſt</note> If the matter be yet thicker and the Heat weaker, and the Cold ſtronger, it cauſes a rough taſt, which is in ſome unripe Apples, in Acorns, and Galls.</p>
                  <p>A Salt Taſt is in an earthy matter,
<note place="margin">Salt taſt</note> not ſubtile, but rather thick and earthy: and it ariſes from an heat exceeding mediocrity. And therefore the firſt ſubject of a Salt taſt is an earthy drineſs, through which a watry moiſture is ſtrained, aduſt, ſo that little of the watry humor remains therein:
<note place="margin">A bitter taſt the biting taſt</note> yet from a ſmal portion thereof a great quantity of Water may be infected. In a bitter taſt Heat is commonly yet greater, and its matter drier and more earthy. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the greateſt heat ariſes the biting Taſt, and it conſiſts in a ſubtile matter: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore things ſo taſted havea faculty of burning, penetrating, and drying; ſuch is in Pepper, Ginger, Garlick, Onions.</p>
                  <p>Thus I ſay, the Peripateticks and the Galeniſts endeavor to deduce the kinds of taſts from the firſt Qualities. But as was ſaid before from the <hi>Exercit.</hi> 297. <hi>S.</hi> 4. of <hi>Scaliger,</hi> Taſts
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:35070:106"/>do no more ariſe from the firſt Qualities than Laughter. And what loſt labor it is to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to give a reaſon of Taſts from the firſt Qualities alone, is learnedly ſhewn by <hi>L. Grillus</hi> in a peculiar Book <hi>de Sapore amaro &amp; dulci.</hi> The Chymiſts more probably draw taſts from Salts, and teach that Salt is the firſt ſubject of Taſts, and that from the ſeveral kinds of Salts proceed the ſundry kinds of Taſts, of which elſwhere in my <hi>Tract. de Conſenſ. et diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſ.

                  </head>
                  <p>THe laſt external Senſe and the moſt common of all the reſt, is the Touch,
<note place="margin">The touch.</note> which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives tangible Qualities. Touching this ſenſe,
<note place="margin">Whether there be but one Senſe of Touching.</note> no ſmal Queſtions are wont to be agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated. And in the firſt place they are wont to enquire; whether the Touch be only one Senſe in number,; or whether there be one power of Feeling, as there is one of Seeing, one of Hearing, one of Smelling, one of Taſting, or more. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> moves this Queſtion in 2 <hi>de Anima Cap</hi> 11. and brings this reaſon of doubting. There is one Senſe of one firſt Contrariety: and one Senſe hath one proper Object, to which all that it perceives may be referred: But the Touch ſeems not to have one common Object, but many: for it perceives Hot, Cold, Dry, Moiſt, Heavy, Light; Hard, Soft; Clammy, Brittle; Rough, Smooth, Thick, Thin; which cannot be reduced to one common kind, or one common notion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which they are perceived by the Touch. Many being perſwaded by this reaſon, have held divers Taſts; ſome two, one to perceive Hot and Cold; another to perceive Moiſt and Dry; others three; the two aforeſaid, to which they attribute alſo Hard and Soft, Rough and Smooth; and a third to perceive Lightneſs and Heavineſs: others hold that there are ſo many ſenſes of Feeling, as there are differences and contratieties of tangible Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. Others have yet added more ſenſes of touching, to perceive Pain, Pleaſure, Venery, Hunger, Thirſt. Others contrariwiſe do hold that there is one only Touch or Senſe of Fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, which though it hath divers Objects, yet it perceives them all under ſome common noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; juſt as the Sight perceives White, Black, Red, Yellow, Green, under the common noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Colour.</p>
                  <p>Now although it be hard to compoſe this Controverſie, and moſt learned men have held, that no certainty can be determined in this Point: yet very many have thought it moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that there is only one faculty of touching. And ſeveral men have ſeverally endeavored to reduce the ſundry differences of tangible Objects to ſome one common Nature. For ſome ſay, though the Object of Feeling be manifold: yet is it contained under one common kind, though it want a name. And that it is a Quality that primarily follows a body as a body, or which immediately depends upon ſublunary Bodies, and neceſſarily accompanies the forms of the Elements, and of the bodies of them compounded. Others alſo attribute to tangible Qualities one manner of affecting the touch, and that they ſay to be a changing of the complexion of the firſt Qualities, and hence the ſenſe of feeling is ſaid to be a ſenſe of the temperament: and that therefore the firſt Qualities are the chief object of feeling, and the reſt pertain thereto after a ſecondary manner; and ſuch things as cannot be reduced to theſe, are common ſenſible objects, which conſtitute no peculiar ſenſe. Finally, others diſtinguiſh betwixt the external ſenſibles, ſuch as are Hot, Cold, Moiſt, Dry, Hard, Soft, &amp;c. and betwixt the internal, which are perceived in the Feeler, as Pain, Pleaſure, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Thirſt. They conceive the external are perceived by one only ſenſe. For although they are many, yet they may be reduced to one common notion: and indeed we find by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that he who can by touch perceive one of thoſe contrarieties, he can alſo feel the other by the ſame part: contrariwiſe he that cannot feel one of them, cannot feel the other. But they hold that Hunger, Thirſt, Pleaſure, Pain Corporeal, are diſcerned by another po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wet; ſeeing theſe powers and acts are ſo ſeparated, that in the part wherein the external are perceived, Hunger, Thirſt, and ſuch like are not perceived.</p>
                  <pb n="380" facs="tcp:35070:107"/>
                  <p> As to the Organ,
<note place="margin">the Organ of feeling:</note> it is not ſo eaſie to find it in this Senſe as in the reſt, and there are very great Controverſies hereabouts, not only among the ancient Writers, but the later alſo: for ſome hold the Fleſh, others the Skin, others ſome other thing to be the ſaid Organ: but we conceive the true Organ of Feeling is a Membrane. For where-ever there is a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, there is alſo Feeling; and where there is no Membrane, there is no Feeling. Hence the Brain feels not ſave by means of the Membranes; and the Membrane which compaſſes the bones being removed, the bones themſelves have no more feeling. Moreover, becauſe the Touch is a Senſe moſt common, and is given to Living Creatures in their whol Bodies, to avoid the external injuries, therefore its Organ was to be ſpread al the body over, and that ſuch an one as ſhould have no other office in the Body: for every Senſe hath its proper Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan. But if we conſider al things in the whol Body, al have peculiar offices ſave a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane: the Nerves carry animal Spirit, the Veins Blood, and other parts (as is known) have other uſes. And therefore this office cannot be aſſigned to them; and there remains only the Membranes which are both ſimilar parts, and have no other uſe, but are given to Living Creatures only, that they might be the immediate Inſtrument of Feeling.</p>

                  <head>Chap. 7 <hi>Of the Internal Senſes.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>HAving explained the External Senſes, we come now to the Internal, which are buſied about matters ſenſible preſented by the external Senſes. For this is the chief diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the internal and external Senſes, That the external are immediately affected by an external object, whence alſo they are called External: But the internal are not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the external ſenſible object immediately, but they are moved by the external Senſes; and therefore they are called Internal. But as touching the Number of the internal Senſes the Controverſie is ſo great (as may be ſeen in <hi>Franciſc. Piccolhomineus, de ſenſ. intern. cap.</hi> 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Franciſc. Toletus <hi>in Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Anima, cap.</hi> 3. <hi>Qu.</hi> 6.

<note place="margin">the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſenſes are three:</note> being herein engaged. We retain the common Opinion, which is the moſt probable, and acknowledg three internal Senſes, from the diverſity of Offices and Works by them performed, viz. Common Senſe, Phantaſie or Imagination, and Memory.</p>
                  <p>We muſt by al means hold a common Senſe:
<note place="margin">Common ſenſe</note> For ſince Animals do know the differences betwixt the proper objects of ſundry Senſes; and the external Senſes cannot perform this Office; ſince each of them knows only its own peculiar object: of neceſſity we muſt hold there is ſome internal Senſe, which apprehends the objects of al the external ſenſes (whence alſo 'tis called the common Senſe) and diſcerns one from another, and does know that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor differs from ſound, ſound from ſmel, ſmel from taſt, taſt from what is hot, that which is hot from that which is black, &amp;c. For the chief Offices of the common Senſe are, to perceive the objects of al the external Senſes by help of the ſaid Senſes; to know and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that we are ſenſible of this or that; to know the difference betwixt the divers objects of the Senſes; to judg the privation and abſence of the objects, as of darkneſs, ſilence, &amp;c. to move the Phantaſie and to offer Images and repreſentations of things thereunto. This Senſe therefore is as it were the middle ſtickler betwixt the Senſes internal and external, and receives images from the external, and communicates them to the reſt of the internal. Whence it is not unfitly compared to the Centre of the Circle, wherein five Lines concur and meet together.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the common Senſe the Phanſie muſt alſo be added.
<note place="margin">Phantaſie:</note> For ſince in perfect living Creatures it is not only neceſſary to apprehend things preſent, but alſo diligently to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that which is no longer preſent, that they may be incited either to ſeek or ſhun the ſame; among the internal Senſes we muſt alſo reckon Phanſie, which may retain the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble repreſentations perceived by the common Senſe, or framed by it ſelf, and diligently exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the ſame. And although it be altogether neceſſary, that the Phanſie be firſt moved by the external Senſe; yet after it hath once perceived the object, and hath committed the image thereof to the memory, afterwards even in the abſence of the external object, it can as often as it liſt review and imagine over again the ſame image. But of neceſſity the Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie muſt firſt be moved by the external Senſe, and we can imagine nothing which we had not before perceived by the external Senſes. And though we may imagine a Mountain of Gold and the Monſter called a <hi>Chimaera,</hi> which we have never totally ſeen; yet we have ſeen
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:35070:107"/>them by piece-meal; and except we had ſeen Gold and a Mountain we could not imagine a Golden Mountain: ſo unleſs we had ſeen a Lyon, a Goat, and a Dragon, we could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the <hi>Chimaera</hi> or Monſter compounded of al thoſe Beaſts.</p>
                  <p>Finally, among the internal Senſes the Memory is to be reckoned:
<note place="margin">the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory:</note> For becauſe the Fanſie without knowledg cannot receive the ſpecies or repreſentations of things; and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take cognizance of many things at once: therefore there is need of a faculty, which it ſelf does not take cognizance, yet is ſubſervient to cognition, that is to ſay, which may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive divers ſenſible repreſentations known by the Fanſie, and reſerve the ſame, and ſuggeſt and preſent the ſame thereto again when need is. Alſo Experience it ſelf does witneſs, that indiſeaſes of the inner Senſes, one of them may be loſt and deſtroyed or depraved, the other remaining ſafe and ſound: and in Feavers it often happens, that the Patients their Memory being ſound, do imagine that there are Fidlers and other things in their Chambers, and ſeek to pick flocks and ſeathers or ſtraws where there are none: and ſuch like examples are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in the Writings of Phyſitians: which is an argument that the Fancy is a faculty di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the Memory.</p>
                  <p>Now ſome do make a twofold Memory, Senſitive and Intellective:
<note place="margin">A twofold Memory.</note> but it is enough to ſay that the Memory is a Faculty common to Man and Beaſt. But after what manner the act of remembring is performed, is a very obſcute point. They commonly hold that ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble objects do imprint certain images on the Brain or Organ of Senſe, even as in Wax the Picture of the Seal is imprinted, which remains after the Seal is taken away. Whence they ſay, ſuch as have an hard and dry brain have an hard apprehenſion of things, but retain them longer; but they that have it moiſt and ſoft, do eaſily receive, but cannot ſo long and faithfully retain.</p>
                  <p>But it is (peradventure) more adviſed to confeſs that in this point we are in the dark, than to hold ſuch things; eſpecially if you weigh that which <hi>Scaliger</hi> hath, in his 397. <hi>Exercit. Sect.</hi> 28. againſt this Opinion. For if Memory be made after this manner, ſince it is in a manner Infinite; in what ſpaces can ſo many Images be retained? in what ſeats can they be ſo diſpoſed and ordered, that we may draw out, rank, direct, every one apart, and al to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Now why a dry Brain is more apt for Memory, <hi>Scaliger</hi> brings a new cauſe in the place forecited, which may there be ſeen.</p>
                  <p>Now there are two acts of Memory, or of the remembring Faculty:
<note place="margin">Two acts of Memory</note> the one of which is called by the name of the Faculty, Memory; the other Remembrance.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                     <note place="margin">Memory.</note> Memory is deſined to be the iterated apprehenſion of a thing formerly known; or a repetition of what hath been formerly perceived by the Senſes, juſt as it was perceived: For examples ſake, if I am asked what's the name of the King of <hi>France,</hi> I can ſuddenly recite the ſame,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                     <note place="margin">Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</note> as I have ſomtimes heard it named. But Remembrance is to go back from one or two things retained in the Memory, til we cal to mind ſomwhat which we had as it were forgotten: as if a man having forgotten a name, ſhould go over al the Letters of the Alphabet, and joyn every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to each Vowel once, and ſo make ſingle ſyllables, til meeting with the firſt ſyllable thereof, he come thereby to cal to mind the whol name which he had forgotten. And therefore more things are required to Remembrance than to Memory; and Memory is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the Bruits, but not Remembrance: For to Memory it is enough that we apprehend a thing again, after the ſame manner as we received it: but to Remembrance it is requiſite, that the thing be firſt forgotten, and then that we hold another thing faſt in Memory, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are brought again to the knowledg of what we had forgotten.</p>
                  <p>Nor does it ſeem neceſſary to hold any more internal Senſes. Some indeed do add the Aeſtimative, to diſcourſe from that which is known to that which is unknown in particulars, or to perceive thoſe things which the Senſes could not perceive: for examples ſake, when the Sheep ſees only the color, bigneſs, and ſhape of the Wolf with its eyes, and yet does not for theſe things fly the Wolf, they conceive it neceſſary to add an Aeſtimative Faculty, whereby the Sheep diſcerns the enmity of the Wolf againſt it ſelf, which fals not under cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of the external Senſes.</p>
                  <p>But this Opinion ſeems not agreeable to truth: For the Faculty of Reaſoning and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing is only in Man alone; and for the apprehenſion of al ſenſible things, the Fancie alone is ſufficient: nor muſt we hold a peculiar faculty which they cal <hi>Aeſtimativa,</hi> becauſe of the enmity, pleaſure, hate, or pain which Animals perceive from ſomethings. For theſe are nothing in the ſenſible object it ſelf, but paſſions and affections following upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of a thing, and proceeding from a certain proper natural Inſtinct which is granted to living Creatures to ſtir up the appetite, either to ſeek or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>un the object. For in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of al ſenſible things, theſe three things do follow one another in order: Firſt the
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:35070:108"/>perception of a ſenſible object under the proper notion of an object: Secondly, pain or pleaſure ariſing from the ſaid perception: Thirdly, a ſtirring up of the Appetite, which either ſeeks the object as pleaſing, or ſhuns the ſame as diſpleaſing. The two former do pertain to the ſame faculty, viz. The ſenſe or Phantaſie, yet with ſome diverſity. For the Apprehenſion of the object under its proper notion; is the work of the Senſe as Senſe, and the Fancy as Fancy; and al Living Creatures do perceive the object under the notion of an object after the ſame manner, both with the external Senſes and the Phantaſie: as al Creatures diſcern a white color as white, none as black. But the Apprehenſion of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject as pleaſing or diſpleaſing, is not of the Senſe as Senſe, nor of the Fancy, nor do the ſame things ſeem pleaſing or diſpleaſing to al Living Creatures: but this belongs to the Senſes as they are limited and determined by the proper form of every Creature; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is for the moſt part unknown to us, is by ſome called natural luſtinct. Hence the ſight of a Wolf is painful to the Sheep, which yet it is not to the Lyon, but rather a delight if the Lyon be hungry.</p>
                  <p>This Queſtion is by <hi>Zabarella</hi> thus explained. But it may to the ſame purpoſe, yet peradventure more cleerly, be thus briefly reſolved. In al living Creatures there is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Vegerative and ſenſitive Soul; but alſo as was ſaid before a certain peculiar ſpecifick form, whereby every Living Creature differs from others of another kind, as for Inſtance whereby a Lyon differs from a Man, an Horſe, an Ox, &amp;c. This in Man kind is the Rational Soul; and in Bruits alſo, it is a peculiar ſoul, which though it be not a rational ſoul, yet it anſwers to the Rational Soul in Men, and is in ſome more noble, in others leſs noble; and to this al thoſe more noble operations, which cannot be referred to the Senſes, and are different in ſeveral Creatures, are to be aſcribed.</p>
                  <p>And therefore their Doctrine is not true (among whom is <hi>Piccolhomineus, de ſenſibus internis, ch.</hi> 11.) who hold that it is one of the Offices of the Fancy, to ad ſubnotions, and to judg the objects to be agreeable or diſagreeable to the Creature; alſo that it is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of ſundry admirable works, which irrational Creatures perform, as the Swallows ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her neſt, the Spiders weaving her web, the Bees making her Honey-comb, &amp;c. For as in Man, to reaſon is not a work of the Fancy; ſo in Bruits it is not the work of Fancy to act ſuch things as are proper to their kind, but of a ſuperior faculty, whereby every Bruit is diſtinguiſhed from other Bruits.</p>
                  <p>Hence that Queſtion of ſome may eaſily be decided,
<note place="margin">whether bruit beaſts are ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal?</note> Whether Bruits are Rational or no? That they are not Rational is certain, becauſe they are not Men. Mean while as a man not by his Fantaſie, but by Reaſon is differenced from other Living Creatures: ſo the ſoul and ſpeciſick form of every Bruit hath a proper faculty above the Fancy, whereby it differs from other Bruits. And hence there is ſo much variety in the actions and works of Bruits, and ſome are more ingenious and crafty than other ſome; the Fox than the Hag, Ox, or Aſs; the Bee than the Fly: Of which matter he that would rightly judg, let him conſider what is written of the Works of Elephants, Dogs, Silk-worms, Bees, &amp;c. and what dayly accurs in Nature.</p>

                  <p>HAving treated of the knowing Faculty of the Senſible Soul: we are now to ſpeak of the Apperite. And although there are ſundry Apperites, and as <hi>Scaliger</hi> in <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Plantis,</hi> writes, the Fare is ſaid to have an Appetite to mount aloſt, the Iron to joyn it ſelf to the Load-ſtone, a Plant to augment its moiſture, an Horſe to Ven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<note place="margin">What the Appetite is</note> which is a power of the Soul, whereby a Living Creature hath an inclination towards ſomthing perceived by the ſenſe. Its object is ſome good thing apprehended by Senſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be really good, or only appear ſo. For the Appetite rends to an end; and every end hath in it the notion of goodneſs. But although the Appetite is ſaid to ſeek good, and fly from evil: yet evil alſo belongs to the Appetite under the notion of good; for to fly evil ſeems to the Appetite a good thing. From the Appetite as its acts proceed the Paſſions and Affections ſo called.</p>

<pb n="383" facs="tcp:35070:108"/>from the Senſitive Soul, whereby they can transfer either their whol Body, or ſome part thereof, from place to place.</p>
                  <p>Now to cauſe this Motion, five things are neceſſary.
<note place="margin">Motion how can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">I. An Object, which may excite the Creature to move, and for the ſake whereof it is moved. For a Living Creature is not moved in vain: but the Appetite is ſtirred up by the Object as its end and good thing deſired.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. There muſt needs be a directing Principle by which (being in the living Creature) the firſt motion is made. For voluntary motion is given to living Creatures, to ſeek out things profitable, and to ſly things hurtful; which cannot be done, unleſs there be ſome power which may know the Object, and offer the ſame to the Appetite, and incite the ſame either to ſeek or to ſhun the ſame. And therefore this principle ought to partake of knowledg. Moreover, becauſe a living Creature is moved not only to things preſent, but abſent alſo; it ought to perceive not only things preſent, but ſuch alſo as are abſent. But theſe conditions do neither ſuit with the nutritive Soul, nor the external Senſes, nor the common Senſe: but only with the Fancy. For although the mind alſo may direct to Motion: yet it is a more remote principle of motion, nor does it move without the Fancy; whereas nevertheleſs the Fancy may move without the Mind; as we ſee in Bruits, which though deſtitute of Reaſon, yet are they incited to motion by their Fancies.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. To come a little neerer, the Principle of Motion and that which commands the Motion is the Appetite. For becauſe the motion of Animals is made to follow after ſome things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and convenient, and to ſly ſome things adverſe and noxious; and that to the Appetite belong the affections of Love and Hatred: of neceſſity in the next place the Locomotive or ſtirring Faculty is moved by the Appetite, ſo that the Appetite commands Motion.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Beſides the Appetite, there is need of an executive power, which may produce into act that motion which is commanded by the Appetite, and perform the ſame. For ſince Local motion is a different operation from the operation of the Appetite, and the operations of the Appetite are immanent, but motion a tranſient action: another power muſt be granted, which is the immediate cauſe of Local voluntary motion in Animals.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. Finally, An Inſtrument is requiſite by which the motion may be performed. For Experience ſhews, that thoſe who have ſome Member maimed, although the object be at hand, and the Fancy do move the Appetite, and the Appetite command motion, yet they cannot ſtir, becauſe of the unfitneſs of the Inſtrument. Now though there is ſome Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie among Authors, what is the Inſtrument of Motion; yet we hold that it is a Muſcle. And whereas ſome make anxious Inquiſition, which part in a Muſcle is the chief Inſtrument of motion, whether a Nerve or a Tendon; they ſeem herein to buſie themſelves more than they need. For, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath it, 2 <hi>de Part. Animal. cap.</hi> 1. The power of ſenſe is in the ſimilar parts, but the Actions are performed by parts diſſimilar.</p>
                  <p>The voluntary motion therefore of a Living Creature is made after this manner and order.
<note place="margin">The mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and order of the motion of a living Creature.</note> In the firſt place an external object is offered, which as an immovable mover, being recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the external Senſes and the common ſenſe, is communicated to the Phantaſie, and is thereby known what it is. Afterward more attently and punctually it is known whether it be convenient and acceptable, or hurtful and unpleaſing. This knowledg is followed by Love or Hate, or an Appetite to lay hold on a thing grateful and delectable, and to avoid a thing hurtful. This Appetite in Bruits is preſently followed by motion.</p>
                  <p>But in Man, before motion be made, ſome things do yet intervene, For the Appetite and theſe motions of the internal Senſes are offered to the Mind, that they may be thereby ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved or diſapproved. If they be approved, and the mind underſtands that the Appetite of the Senſes is right, preſently motion follows: but if it be rejected as falſe, a contention and fight ariſes betwixt the ſenſitive appetite and the rational, til the one vanquiſhes the other; and that which overcomes is the principle of the motion, and commands the motive faculty to move. The motive faculty being implanted in al the Muſcles of the whol Body, does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract ſuch Muſcles as are needful: the Muſcles being contracted draw the Tendons to them, the Tendons being drawn draw the Bones: finally, the Bones being moved, the Member or whol Body is transferred from place to place.</p>

                  <head>Chap. 9. <hi>Of Sleep, Waking, and Dreams.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>SLeep and Waking are Affections of the Senſes hither to explained. For we perceive a Man is awake, by the exerciſe of his external ſenſes; and that he is aſleep by their ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from operation. And therefore ſleep ſeems to be a privation of waking: and ſleep and waking belong to the ſame faculty, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſenſitive: and ſleep and waking are affections of the ſenſe, agreeing to all Animals and to them alone. And therefore things deſtitute of a ſenſitive Soul neither ſleep nor wake, as Plants. Again no Living Creature doth alwaies ſleep, nor alwaies wake. For becauſe al things muſt neceſſarily be weakned in their Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the Spirits are conſumed by the operations of the Senſes; Sleep is alſo neceſſary to repair the ſtrength and reſtore the Spirits. And though this be not ſo manifeſt in the more imperfect Animals, which are not furniſhed with all their Senſes; yet manifeſt experience convinces that the more perfect Animals do ſleep. Of which ſee <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his 4. <hi>de Hiſt. Animal, cap.</hi> 10. <hi>Pliny</hi> in <hi>Lib.</hi> 10. <hi>Nat. Hiſt. cap.</hi> 75.</p>
                  <p>Now Sleep is not every ceſſation of the Senſes,
<note place="margin">the Cauſe of Sleep.</note> or impotency in the exerciſe of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: for even in ſwouning fits alſo, and other Diſeaſes, the operations of the Senſes ceaſe: but when there is an inability to operate in the firſt Organ of Senſe. Sleep therefore is a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ceſſation of the common ſenſe and the other ſenſes, cauſed for the good of living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaies in his <hi>B. De Somn. &amp; Vigil. cap.</hi> 3. <hi>It is the Ceſſation of the firſt original of ſenſe, as being unable. to act,</hi> of which definition ſee <hi>Scaliger</hi> in <hi>Exercit.</hi> 289. Now the common ſenſe is chiefly affected in ſleep; and it reſting the other external ſenſes reſt alſo. But the other internal ſenſes do not alwaies neceſſarily reſt in ſleep: but if they do, it is becauſe the external reſt. For if the Fancy doth ſomtimes not operate in ſleep, that doth not therefore happen becauſe ſleep is an affection or adjunct thereof, but becauſe there is nothing brought unto it from the external ſenſes to buſie the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Now what the Cauſe is which thus binds as it were the external ſenſes, is worth our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry. The cauſe whereof is nothing, but that the animal ſpirits do not flow from the Brain into the Organs of the Senſes. But what ſhould hinder the Influx of the ſpirits is ſomwhat obſcure. <hi>Ariſtotle de Somno &amp; Vigil. cap.</hi> 3. held that this was cauſed by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the paſſage of the common ſenſe, through which the animal ſpirits as a common Inſtrument of the Soul are ſent into the Organs of all the ſenſes. Now the obſtruction he ſaies is cauſed by vapors, chiefly ſuch as are carried out of the Stomack into the Brain. For they when the living Creature reſts, whereby the Brain becomes ſomwhat colder, are condenſed, and become more thick and heavy, and ſo begin to deſcend again, and ſtop the paſſages of the Nerves, ſo that the animal ſpirit cannot be carried into the Organs of the Senſes, of which thing there are many tokens: for after meat, eſpecially if we have eaten liberally, we become ſleepy, and Perſons that are drunk ſleep exceedingly: contrariwiſe, ſuch as have faſted long cannot ſleep a nights, and moſt ſleepy medicaments do ſend many vapors into the Head; or cool the Brain, that the vapors may be therein ſomwhat thickned, and ſo may ſtop the paſſages. Others contrariwiſe, conceive the ſleep is not cauſed by vapors, nor by ſuch things as ſtop the paſſages of the Nerves, but becauſe the ſoul draws back the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to it ſelf, leſt by continual operation the animal faculties ſhould be deſtroyed. Hence not only after Meat ſleep comes; but Muſick, Wearineſs, Darkneſs, and Quiet cauſe fleep.</p>
                  <p>But both theſe Opinions ought (I conceive) to be joyned together, and thus Sleep is bred. The living Creature being compoſed to reſt, the Soul finding a kind of languiſhing feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by reaſon of the operations of the ſenſes all day long, diſſipation of the ſpirits, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the quickening heat of the Sun, endeavors a reſtauration and recreation of the ſtrength and ſpirits to the preſervation of the living Creature in Health. And becauſe the animal ſpirits have their original from the Vital, that the Vital may firſt be reſtored and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paited, the Heart draws to it ſelf ſome Heat, which is ſcattered into the other parts. Hence the remote members, and eſpecially the Brain, becomes a little colder, to which the coldneſs of the nights Air, and the Ceaſing of the bodies motion, which cauſes heat, do lend an helping hand: but the Heat about the Heart and parts thereabouts is encreaſed. The Heat there encreaſed raiſes out of the Aliment certain ſweet vapors, which being carried to the Brain, by the coldneſs thereof are a little thickned, and begin again to deſcend; and ſlipping into the roots of the Nerves they fil and ſtop their paſſages, and are the cauſe, both that the vital ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and Heat cannot aſcend out of the lower parts into the Brain, and that the animal ſpirits
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:35070:109"/>cannot be diſtributed into the Organs of the Senſes: for want of ſpirits all the members do hang looſ, and al the operations of the external Senſes do ceaſe.</p>
                  <p>The End therefore of Sleep is to reſtore the ſtrength of living Creatures.
<note place="margin">the End of Sleep.</note> For becauſe much ſpirit is conſumed by motion, and the operation of the external ſenſes, that the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may not be endamaged in point of health, they muſt of neceſſity be reſtored. <hi>Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> in <hi>Exercitat.</hi> 289. adds another End, in theſe words: <hi>Sleep was made by God, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (as is wel ſaid) to refreſh and repair the Body, but for the Liberty of the Mind. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if you regard the offices of life, when we ſleep we live but the life of Plants; it was his pleaſure that then we ſhould truly live: For the Servant at that time is free, yea and becomes a Maſter ſomtimes in his Dreams. The Minds of evil men are puniſhed in Dreams, thoſe of good and wiſe men become divine, by the ſearching out of truth and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of laudible offices. For being freed not from the Body, but from its ſervice, they do their own work: for they move themſelves, and alſo advance themſelves to the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of their End which they ſhal in time ſee face to face.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To Sleep, <hi>Watching</hi> is oppoſed,
<note place="margin">Watching.</note> which is nothing but the Activity or Freedom of the Senſes. Now a living Creature is wakened from ſleep two manner of waies, either of its own accord, or being diſturbed and troubled by ſome external Cauſe. The firſt manner is moſt natural, and comes to paſs when the Heat which had hid it ſelf within, for the dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of the aliments, and reparation of the ſpirits (concoction being finiſhed, and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits repaired) doth again break forth into the outward parts, and diſcuſſes thoſe vapors which were an obſtacle to the Spirits, that the Spirits may freely paſs into the Organs of the ſenſes. Now although ſomtimes the living Creature is awaked of it ſelf, before conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction be finiſhed (if ſharp vapors ariſing from bad humors be carried into the Brain; or through ſome other Cauſes) yet this manner aforeſaid is moſt common and natural.</p>
                  <p>Now the wakening of a man out of ſleep by external things, (as if a man be rouzed by crying aloud and pulling) is cauſed by perception of external ſenſible objects. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in ſleep there is a defect of ſpirits in the Inſtruments of the ſenſes: yet the Organs are not quite void of animal ſpirits, but there are ſome yet remaining in them, which are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to perceive vehement ſenſible objects. Therefore the ſenſititive ſoul in ſleep being ſtirred up and provoked by a vehement external object does begin to exerciſe its ſenſes, and at firſt it obſcurely perceives the object, but afterward that it may more clearly diſcern the ſame, it gives out a greater quantity of ſpirits; which ſeeking way to the Organ of that ſenſe which is affected, they break through the paſſage of the common ſenſe; and ſo way is opened to the Organs of al the Senſes, and conſequently the ſleep ceaſes. Hence they who in ſleep have the paſſages of their ſenſes obſtructed by many thick vapors, which is uſual in ſuch as are drunk; they are hardly awakened, nor can their ſpirits eaſily find their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage: but thoſe who abound not with thick vapors are eaſily awakened. For the ſame cauſe the firſt ſleep is more ſound and deep; becauſe the vapors in the firſt concoction are more plentiful and thick, which afterward are by little and little conſumed and atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated.</p>
                  <p>In ſleepy Dreams do happen, which are no paſſion of the external ſenſes.
<note place="margin">What a Dream it.</note> For in ſuch as ſleep (who only Dream) all the external ſenſes are bound and tied up. Nor is a Dream a paſſion of the rational Soul: for Dogs and other Creatures Dream as wel as Man-kind. But a Dream is an adjunct of the internal ſenſes, and eſpecially of the Fancy: and it is defined to be a Phantaſm or Apparition happening to ſuch as ſleep.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe in ſuch as Dream the Fancy is buſied, and ſome apparition appears there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; and we Dream not only of things which we have done in the day time, but alſo of things a great way off, and which we have neither ſeen nor heard, nor perceived by any of our ſenſes, yea and of things never yet done, but which are hereafter to come to paſs: The Queſtion is how the Images of things abſent, never perceived by our ſenſes, and which are not yet come to paſs, can be offered to our Fancy. The Epicureans held (as appears out of <hi>Lucretius, Lib.</hi> 4.) <hi>That certain thin Images do come from the outſides of viſible objects, which are as it were their Skins and Barks, having the repreſentation of the things from whence they came.</hi> And theſe they thought did inſinuate themſelves into Perſons aſleep, and foreſhew things to come. But this Opinion hath been long ago rejected.</p>
                  <p>The conceit of <hi>Coelius Rhodiginus</hi> is not much better, who in the 27. <hi>Book of his ancient readings, Chap.</hi> 11. denies that there are any ſuch Images flying up and down in the Air, as the Epicureans imagined: yet grants that there are certain motions which exerciſe and work upon us in ſtead of Images, and that they do proceed from the Beginnings of certain things afterwards to be ſaid or done, the Air being firſt changed, which being afterwards through
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:35070:110"/>the Noſtrils and Ears tranſmitted to the Heart, they cauſe us in Dreams to foreſee the events of future things. And that theſe motions cannot at any other time make themſelves ſenſible ſave in the night. But what motions can there be of things which are not? or how can things abſent fifty or a hundred miles al along affect the Air? or why ſhould not theſe motions affect any perſons that ſleep, but only ſuch as are concerned to know the thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed?</p>
                  <p>We refer all ſuch Dreams which are of things which we never before perceived with our Senſe, or ariſe from cauſes which are not in our bodies, unto a more Divine power. Thus therefore we conceive Dreams are to be divided.</p>
                  <p>Dreams are ſome Natural,
<note place="margin">The Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of Dreams. Animal Dreams.</note> others Supernatural or Divine. The Natural are ſuch as proceed from Natural cauſes. And theſe again are by ſome divided into Ammal and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural peculiarly ſo called. Thoſe are called Animal which are converſant about ſuch things as have been preſented to us while we were awake. For certain ſpecies or Images of ſenſible things are imprinted upon the internal Senſes, which remain even then when the Senſes work not, and when ſenſible objects are abſent, and raiſe dreams. Theſe though they do not alwaies appear to perſons awake, being buſied about other objects: yet in perſons aſleep, the Senſes ceaſing to operate, they again ariſe, and preſent themſelves to the Fancy. Theſe Dreams do not alwaies preſent things to us juſt as they were acted: for nothing can be imagined ſo fooliſh, abſurd, and monſtrous, which is not preſented unto us ſomtimes in Dreams. For the Soul being not wrought upon by external Objects, revolves the Images of things formerly preſented, and joyns this with that as each offers it ſelf, and of many and divers things compounds one; alſo it wonderfully confounds the order and circumſtances of things. And to this the plenty of bad vapors is a furtherance. For as bad vapors and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors in perſons awake, as in ſuch as are melancholy and mad, by diſturbing the Brain are a cauſe of abſurd cogitations; ſo they do the ſame in perſons aſleep; ſo that it is rightly ſaid, Dreams are the Ravings of perſons aſleep, and Ravings are the Dreams of ſuch as are awake. Hence melancholick perſons, and ſuch as have over eaten, have abſurd and terrible Dreams. And for the ſame cauſe, ſuch as are drunk, and thoſe that firſt compoſe themſelves to ſleep, have for the moſt part no Dreams; becauſe there is in them ſo great ſtore of vapors that their Brain is filled, and al the images overwhelmed: But towards day, and after the Meat is digeſted, the Dreams are more cleer, becauſe the vapors ariſing from the Meat are attenuated and for the moſt part diſcuſſed.</p>
                  <p>But Natural Dreams are ſuch as ariſe from ſome hidden cauſe in the Body,
<note place="margin">Natural Dreams.</note> as the humors, temperaments, &amp;c. For if ſuch a cauſe be vehement, it may even in ſleep alſo affect ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſenſe, and preſent an image of it ſelf to the Fancy; yet it ſeldom does it diſtinctly, but by the appearance of ſome other thing like to it, or joyned with the appearance of a like thing. So as <hi>Galen</hi> relates <hi>de Praeſag. ex Inſomniis,</hi> when a certain man dreamed that one of his Thighs was turned into a ſtone, a while after unexpectedly he was taken with a palſie in the ſame Thigh.</p>
                  <p>But to Supernatural Dreams we refer al thoſe which are ſent into us by higher and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural cauſes;
<note place="margin">Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Dreams. Divine Dreams.</note> whether it be by God, good Angels, or Devils. Such as are infuſed by God and good Angels, are termed Divine, of which ſome examples are extant in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. For the moſt good and great God is wont to preſent to men in Dreams, either new Images of things, or ſo to order and joyn ſuch as were in them before, that they may become warnings of things to come. Alſo the Angels are wont to excite and aptly to diſpoſe ſuch Images, Spirits, or Humors as are in the Body, as that they may admoniſh a man of ſome neceſſary and profitable thing.
<note place="margin">Diabolical Dreams.</note> But Diabolical Dreams are cauſed after the ſame manner as the Angelical, but to a different end: For the Devil ſtudies to do men miſchief, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors even by Dreams to poſſeſs them with vain Superſtitions; which the Oracles ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in Dreams do witneſs; ſome examples whereof are related by <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Book <hi>de Anima. Coelius Rhodigin. antiq. Lect. lib.</hi> 27. <hi>cap.</hi> 14. or by ungodly and laſcivious Dreams he endeavors to allure men to luſts and unlawful pleaſures.</p>
                  <p>From the Premiſes it is apparent how even abſent and future things may be preſented to us in a Dream. The Platoniſts conceive many Dreams may be cauſed by the Geniuſes and Spirits which they conceived did attend upon every man, and admoniſh them of many things; and the Divines refer them more rightly to Angels, which many think every man hath to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him. But this ſeems fit to be added to what hath been ſaid out of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who in his Book <hi>de Anima</hi> thus writes; the liberality of Divine Dreams is alſo wont to drop down upon prophane perſons, God making the Sun to ſhine upon the juſt and unjuſt. For even <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had a Divine Dream. And as Gods goodneſs vouchſafes it ſelf to
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:35070:110"/>Heathens, ſo alſo the tentations of the Devil do follow even holy men, whom he abſtains not to tempt by day, or to moleſt when they are aſleep, if he cannot do it when they are waking.</p>
                  <p>From what hath been ſaid it is eaſie to collect what we are to think of Divination by Dreams. For Dreams are either Significative, which foretel ſomwhat; or Nonſignificative,
<note place="margin">Touching Divination by Dreams.</note> which foreſhew nothing. Again, ſignificative Dreams are either Theorematical, which cleerly expreſs the Nature of the Event; or Allegorical, which expreſs the thing foreſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wrapt up in figures and Allegories. To explain theſe latter is not in the reach of every one; but they are the beſt expounders of Dreams, who can beſt diſcern the ſimilitudes and reſemblances of things: whereof the Books of Interpretations of Dreams do treat.</p>
                  <p>The Dreams infuſed by God and good Angels do queſtionleſs foreſhew ſomewhat to come: but al cannot expound them, only they that have it granted them by God. Moſt Diabolical Dreams are vain, and ſent to allure men to ſin; and if any of them be true (for the Devil alſo can ſomtimes conjecture things to come, knowing them by their ſuperior Cauſes or Signs) he does alſo by them endeavor to draw men to ſome falſe Religion. But Natural Dreams, which ariſe from the Conſtitution of our Bodies, do alſo afford figns thereof; and Phyſitians are wont to obſerve them; and what Dreams do argue ſuch and ſuch Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Body, is taught at large by <hi>Hippocrates, de Inſomniis,</hi> and by <hi>Galen</hi> in his Treatiſe <hi>de praeſagiis ex Inſomniis:</hi> and ſeeing theſe are moſt frequent, it is wel ſaid by the Preacher, <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> 5. <hi>In the multitude of Dreams and many words there is much vanity: but fear thou God.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>HAving ſpoken of the Form of Bruit Beaſts, we ſhould now ſpeak of their Bodies. But foraſmuch as Man of al Animals or living things (for we trouble not our ſelves whether theſe terms do differ, of which ſee <hi>Scaliger, Exercit.</hi> 216.) is the moſt perfect; and in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kind the more imperfect are to be judged by the moſt perfect: Moreover, the parts of al Animals or Living Creatures are not yet known and deſcribed; but in the deſcription of the parts of Mans Body Anatomiſts have been as diligent as can be imagined: Such things as ſhould have been ſaid of the pirts of Living Creatures in general, muſt he ſetcht from the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>s of Man; and ſuch things wherein the parts of other Creatures differ from thoſe of Man, muſt be taken into conſideration. We ſhal here therefore treat rather of the differences of Ammals; where alſo ſome things wil fal in our way as touching their parts. And ſeeing every living Creature conſiſts of a Soul and a Body, we wil weigh and conſider the chief differences which ſlow both from the Soul, and from the Body, and from the whol Creature, conſiſting and made up of both.</p>
                  <p>And firſt as to the Vegetative Faculty, three things are therein conſiderable: Nutrition,
<note place="margin">The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of Living Creatures in reſpect of the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getative faculty.</note> Augmentation, and Generation. And as for Nutrition, there is no Bruit Beaſt which does no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> eat ſome kind of food or other: for ſome eat fleſh, as the Wolf, Tigre, &amp;c. ſome eat divers kind of things promiſcuouſly, as Dogs; ſome Herbs and Corn, as Horſes, Harts, &amp;c. ſome feed on Worms, as very many Birds; and ſome on Fiſhes. And of theſe again, ſome hunt for their living, and prey upon other Creatures, as the Crocodile, the Lyon, the Wolf, &amp;c. ſome lay up their Meat in Summer, as the Piſmires; ſome ſeek their Prey night and day.</p>
                  <p>As to Generation, Bruit Beaſts have doubtleſs a Faculty (which they received from the bleſſing of God at the Creation) of multiplying themſelves by mediation of a certain Seed, whether it be properly ſo called, or analogically, in ſuch things as are commonly ſaid to be produced by equivocal Generation. For we find by experience that Inſects and ſuch like things, which are ſaid to be produced by equivocal generation, are not generated in any, but only in ſome peculiar ſort of matter. For a Beetle is not bred of any, but only of ſome determinate ſort of Matter. Hence alſo it comes to paſs that Beaſts generated of a putrid ſubſtance, containing therein a ſitting Seed, are not found to differ from other Creatures of the ſame name. For beſides that they agree altogether in form and figure, they do moreover poſſeſs the ſame proprieties, and perform the ſame operations, and can beget their like.</p>
                  <p>For living Creatures are produced three manner of waies:
<note place="margin">A three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Living Creatures<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> Some by a mutual Conjunction of male and female; ſome out of the putrid matter of a corrupted body, but containing in it a ſead fit to propagate ſuch a Creature: and ſome are produced both waies, viz. both by
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:35070:111"/>Copulation and by putrefaction, as Mice, Locuſts, Beetles, Flies, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, Bruit Creatures ingender after ſundry manners; ſome produce live Creatures, and are therefore called <hi>Vivipara,</hi> as Does, Bitches, Dolphins, Vipers; ſome bring forth Eggs, out of which cheriſhed with a bening gentle Heat, are hatched Chicken, Birds, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes: Finally, ſome bring forth a Worm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> defines an Egg,
<note place="margin">What an Egg is.</note> that thereout an Animal does exiſt, not from the whol, but from one part thereof only, the reft being turned into nouriſhment: and a Worm he defines by ſaying, that the whol grows up into an Animal. And ſo <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> divides an Egg into two parts; which in perfecter Creatures are manifeſtly different and diſtinct in color; but in the imperfecter ſort of Creatures they are not ſeen diſtinct, but both are confounded and jumbled together into one ſubſtance.
<note place="margin">Of which part of the Egg the Creature is made.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But of what part of the Egg the Creature is made, is a controverted point. <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> or the Author of the Book <hi>de Natura pueri,</hi> ſaies, That it is made of the Yolk; <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> ſaies of the White. If we conſult with experience we ſhal find it as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaics; and thus we ſhal find it to be: If you ſhal open an Egg the ſecond, third, or fourth day after the Hen hath ſat upon it, and diligently view the ſame; you may eaſily obſerve that the Heart is the principal Member: For it is eaſie to ſee that the rude Chick is firſt formed, and in it, firſt the Heart, which ſends forth two veins; and after the generation of the yong Chick, the Membranes which are thereto ſubſervient are evidently ſeen to grow together. And indeed on the eighth day, the heart is not only apparent, but together with the Veins, being of the ſame red color, it is manifeſtly ſeen to move and beat. On the fourth day the bodies of the Membranes being now confirmed and grown thicker, begin to be leſs tranſparent: on the ſeventh day by reaſon of their compactneſs, they obſcure the whol Chick in a manner, or cover the ſame; yet the Heart is ſeen by its conſpicuous red color, as alſo the Veins, and by its motion. Mean while, the Liver does not yet appear, but on the ſeventh day there is firſt ſeen a liquor or yellowiſh ſlimy Matter underneath the Heart, which is the beginning of the Liver growing together, and in the following daies it makes up this Body of the Liver; till which time there remains much of the Yolk, yea, when the Chickens are hatched. And in this place of the Liver for nine whol daies together, after the firſt formation, no blood in ſeen; the heart notwithſtanding in the mean while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ful of blood, as alſo a moſt large Vein, drawn under the heart, the whol Bodies length. By al which it appears manifeſt, that the Soul ſticks in the Heart as in its Root, and that the Heart is the firſt thing which lives, and is the Creature as it were.</p>
                  <p>But of which part of the Egg the Chick is framed, and with which part it is nouriſhed, is not ſo plain: yet thus the matter ſeems to go. Much about the middle of the Egg long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, where the Yolk is joyned to the White above, the ſecond day after the Hens ſitting, there is a certain whitiſh beginning, more compact than the reſt of the White, and as it were through a glaſs there is the appearance of a Chicken, the head being moſt conſpicuous, and near the Head a red point dilating and contracting it ſelf: The daies following, from that red point a very red Vein is drawn al along the Chickens back, every day further and further; from which afterwards Veins proceed to the skins drawn about the yolk. By which it may be conjectured, that the Chick is firſt made of the White; and that the aliment to be turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to blood is made of the Yolk, and carried through the Veins to the little skins ſtretched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Yolk, and perfected in the Liver, which Liver hath alſo a ſimilitude with the Yolk. Yet if any man ſhal hold, that the Yolk gives nouriſhment to the blood and parts nouriſhed with blood; and the White to white parts bred of it ſelf, and like to it ſelf, til the Liver grow ſo ſtrong as to be able to afford nouriſhment to al the parts, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the place of ſhaping is in the confines of the White and the Yolk, I ſhal not contend with him thereabouts.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit ſome Creatures there are, which engender not only often, but bring forth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yong ones at a time, as Swine, Hares, Pidgeons, &amp;c but ſome bring forth few yong at a time, and ſeldom alſo. And al for the moſt part by mediation of the two Sexes; nor are the Sexes confounded in any kind of Creatures, ſo that the male ſhould be female, or the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male male; which ſome confidently affirm of Hares. Although it may be perhaps granted, That Hermaphrodites are more frequent in this kind of Creatures than in any others.
<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Creatures according to the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. Moles.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is alſo ſome difference in Creatures with reference to the Senſitive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty: For every ſenſe is not allowed to every Animal; howbeit the Feeling, as the firſt ſenſe, is granted to al Creatures. And thoſe that have only this ſenſe and want al the reſt, are called <hi>Zoophita,</hi> Plant-animals. All other Creatures have more Senſes. Nor do we think fit to deny Sight to the Moles; for to what end have they Eyes if they cannot ſee? For
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:35070:111"/>although they have no need of ſight, to ſee under the ground, yet they have it given them to avoid the light and the bright air; of which ſee <hi>Scaliger</hi> in <hi>Exercit.</hi> 244.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit, ſome Creatures excel in one ſenſe, ſome in another; ſome in ſeeing, others in ſmelling; ſome in one are more excellent, ſome in another, both external and internal Senſes.</p>
                  <p>Finally, there is great difference in living Creatures,
<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Animals in reſpect of the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comotive faculty.</note> with reference to their faculty Loco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motive, whereby they remove from place to place: For every Creature does ſhift place, but ſome after one manner, and ſome after another. Some only in part, as was ſaid of the Plant-animals, which though they are alwaies fixed in the ſame place, yet they contract and dilate themſelves. But others move their whol bodies, ſome after one manner, others after another: For ſome Beaſts go, and that either on two ſeet, on four, ſix, or more, as Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; ſome move themſelves by ſwimming, as Fiſhes, and ſome that live both on Land and Water; others by flying, as Birds; ſome by leaping, as Graſhoppers; finally, ſome by creeping and crawling, as Worms and Serpents, who by contraction and dilatation of their bodies do move themſelves from place to place.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, in reſpect of their parts, there is a great variety in Animals:
<note place="margin">the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Creatures in reſpect of their parts.</note> For as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath it in 1. <hi>de Hiſt. Animal. cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Parts of Animals are the ſame and divers, either in form, or ſort, or exuperance, or analogie, or ſcituation.</hi> And in the firſt place the parts by which they take their nouriſhment, and whereinto they beſtow the ſame, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to al Creatures. For the neceſſity of food is common to them with Plants: which Plants indeed have from the Earth, and therefore ſticking in the Earth they have nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enough. But Animals (ſeeing they are more perfect than Plants) they were to have more exquiſite diet than ſuch as the Earth affords. And therefore they had not only taſt given them to try their meats, but alſo members wherewith to receive the ſame, and turn it into juyce fit to nouriſh the body, viz. The Mouth and Stomach.</p>
                  <p>Now this Aliment received is in ſeveral Animals ſeverally changed into Nutriment pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called, or an humor which is the immediate aliment of the body, which when either by Nature it ſelf (the heat in proceſs of time devouring the ſame) or by violence (as in ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and other caſes) it comes to be conſumed, the life is extinguiſhed. Now this Humor, the next aliment of the body, is in ſome blood, in others a fatty and bloody moiſture, like Sames or Blood-water running from hurts of the body; as alſo the part wherein this aliment is contained is in ſome a Vein, in others a Fibre. Hence Animals are divided into ſuch as have blood, &amp; ſuch as are bloodleſs. In the more perfect ſort of animals, intended for nobler actions, and therefore needing more heat, this Humor is red and is called Blood. Yet there is in ſome bloodleſs Animals a certain red humor which is not blood, but an excrement, as in the <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pura.</hi> But other Animals whoſe bodies are more imperfect, do alſo need a leſs perfect nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment; if moiſt, an white; if dry, a more obſcure humor: which humors having no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per names, they are termed <hi>Ichores,</hi> and are blood as it were newly begun to be made and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect. As alſo in Creatures that have blood, when the blood is not wel elaborated, it puts on the nature of an Ichor as it were, as we ſee in Cachectical perſons.</p>
                  <p>Alſo al Living Creatures have an Head, except the <hi>Polypus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">the Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus. the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant.</note> who inſtead of an Head carries as it were a Hive. Limbs are wanting in ſome Infects; in others the fore feet are inſtead of fingers. The Elephant inſtead of hands hath his Trunk let down from his Mouth. Fiſhes have no necks. Moſt Creatures have Tails, and they are of ſeveral faſhions, which Man hath not. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Teeth Birds have Bils of a boney nature, wherwith they do break their meat; inſtead of Noſtrils they have only two holes; as alſo two paſſages inſtead of Ears. Moles have their Eyes obſcurely buried, yet are they not without Eyes. Inſtead of a Tongue many Creatures have a fleſhy ſubſtance in their Mouths; and many with an external ſharp tool ſpungy and hollow do both taſt and draw their meat to them. All Creatures that have Blood have Skin. There is in all Creatures having blood and heads properly ſo called a Brain, which on the fore ſide is divided into two parts. The Seeing, Hearing, and Taſting Nerves, with the other parts which make up the whol Organ of Senſe, are found in al perfect Animals. And the Heart, or at leaſt ſomwhat anſwering thereto, is in al living Creatures. There is no Lungs in Fiſhes; inſtead of members of generation, Fiſhes and Serpents have certain holes ordained for their ſeed. Moſt of the Guts and Bowels are to be ſeen in perfect li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creatures; but in the imperfect they do not exactly agree with thoſe of a Mans body, and for the moſt part they differ in Fiſhes and Serpents. Fiſhes inſtead of bones have a ſpine. Inſects have a condition proper to themſelves; for they have a cloven fleſh oblique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly directed, and ſomthing of a middle nature betwixt nerves and fleſh, which is to them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:35070:112"/>of Bones and Spines. Proper Spirits are given to every living Creature, which the Soul doth unmediately uſe to exerciſe ſenſitive actions.</p>
                  <p>Moreover there are other Differences of Animals from the places wherein they live,
<note place="margin">Difference of Living Creatures from the place where they live. Whether any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures live in the Fire</note> and their Actions. For firſt, ſome inhabit only one Element and live thereof; in the Air the <hi>Manuco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>a;</hi> in the Water the <hi>Apua;</hi> in the Earth the Toad. But whether there are any Creatures that live in the Fire, Authors are at variance. Some hold that the Salaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Pyrauſtae live in the Fire, as <hi>Ariſtotle, Pliny, Aelian, Auſtin.</hi> As to Salamaders they are ſo far from delighting in Fire, that they are found no where but in places both cold and moiſt, and they put out moſt hot burning coals, either by their coldneſs or clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineſs of ſubſtance, before they can be burnt. That the Pyrauſtae live in the Fire <hi>Scaliger</hi> eagerly defends, <hi>Exercit.</hi> 9.23. <hi>and</hi> 194. <hi>ſect.</hi> 4. But others hold there is no Animal which is not burnt and kil'd in the Fire; and that the Pyrauſtae indeed are bred and foſtered in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle holes about Furnaces, but never bide in the Fire, whereinto being caſt they are burnt: which is probable. Some Living Creatures live in two Elements, and find their meat in both, as Bats or Flitter-mice, which catch Gnats in the Air, and plunder the flitch of Bacon on Earth.</p>
                  <p>All theſe may again be included under three kinds, Birds, Fiſhes, and Land Beaſts. The <hi>Manucodiata</hi> (a Bird) lives only in the Air: In the Ocean of <hi>Braſile</hi> there are Sea-Geeſe which live only in the Water, and never fly out, of a black Colour. In <hi>Mare del Zur,</hi> towards <hi>China,</hi> there are footleſs Birds, which never forſake the Water. The Oſtrich lives only on Land. The Hern lives on Water and Land. The Bat lives in the Air and Earth; The Swan lives, but feeds not in all three Elements.</p>
                  <p>Fiſhes that live in the Water and Land are the <hi>Polypus</hi> and Crabs. Thoſe that are in two are alſo in three; for they are in the Air, Water and Earth, that are in the Earth and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for they cannot be on the Earth, but they muſt be alſo in the Air.</p>
                  <p>Of Land Creatures which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> terms <hi>Peza</hi> (which word cannot eaſily be rendred in Latine) ſome live on the Land and Water, and ſeek their Food in both Elements, as Otters; ſome which are very greedy after Fiſh cannot endure to touch the Water, as Cats: ſome live only on the Earth.</p>
                  <p>Living Creatures are after another manner thus divided. By reaſon of their Food, ſome are Land Creatures, and others of the Water. Thoſe that live in the Water, do either take in the Water, or they do not. Thoſe Fiſhes take in the Water that are fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with Gils. Thoſe which take not in the Water do draw in the Air, or they do not draw it in. Thoſe that draw in the Air and have Feet, are the Otters, Crocodiles, and ſuch like; of thoſe that have not Feet and draw in Air, is the Water-ſnake; ſuch as of this kind have Wings, are the Cormorant, Sea-gul, &amp;c. Thoſe that draw not in the Air are the Urti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, and all Shel-fiſh. But of Land Creatures, all that have Blood and Lungs draw in Air; but Waſps, Bees, and all Inſects do not.</p>
                  <p>Again, of Land Creatures ſome fly as Birds, Bees; ſome go only on the Ground, either with Feet or ſome other way.</p>
                  <p>Such as paſs upon the Ground, are either Goers, or Creepers, or ſuch as draw their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Goers uſe Feet, amongſt which Leapers are reckoned: But the Creepers by twiſting their long Bodies, and bearing on two ſides, as four-footed Beaſts on two Legs of a ſide, do ſo move themſelves. Such as draw themſelves, are thoſe which put forth their former parts and draw their hinder parts after them and ſo win Ground.</p>
                  <p>As to their Differences in the actions of their Life and Manners,
<note place="margin">The Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Creatures in reſpect of their actions.</note> ſome Creatures live in Flocks and Companies, others live ſingle and ſolitary, and ſome live both ſolitary and in Companies. Birds that live in Companies are Pigeons, Cranes: the ſolitary are all Birds that have crooked Talons, none of which live in Companies. Among Fiſhes the Runners, the Tuny-fiſh, Whitings, Makerels. Now Creatures live ſolitary being neceſſitated thereto for getting their food. For though all kinds of living Creatures do fly thoſe of another kind and think they may live more ſafely with thoſe of their own kind, being allured by likeneſs: yet Beaſts that have Scarcity of food, and meet ſeldom with their Prey, as Birds with crooked Talons, cannot converſe with many of their own kind: For as ſome that meet with plenty of food, live in Flocks, as Pigeons: ſo to theſe (and to theſe alone) by reaſon of the ſcarcity of their food Nature hath given both Strength of Body and Fierceneſs of Mind; and the ſcarcity of their Foot compels them to Prey upon other Creatures.</p>
                  <p>Again whether they live in Flocks or Single, ſome do alwaies inhabit the ſame Country, ſome do go out of one into another, and return back again.</p>
                  <p>Again of thoſe that live in Companies ſome are Political, others are not, but mind only their own buſineſs. The Political are ſuch as obſerve a civil Policy, which requires that
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:35070:112"/>publick works be orderly performed by all, and that there be a Communion of the Profits ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; and thus do the Bees, the Piſmires, the Doves; but the Sparrows obſerve no ſuch Order. For though they fly in Companies, yet each one by it ſelf ſeeks its own livelihood, and labors not at all for the whol Society, which the Bees and the Piſmires or Ants do.</p>
                  <p>Again, ſome Creatures are Fleſh-eaters, others feed on Graſs; ſome are Fiſh-eaters, others Worm-eaters, ſome All-eaters that will down with any thing, ſome have a meat peculiar to themſelves, as the Bees, of which we ſpake before.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, ſome live in the open Air under the Canopy of Heaven, others live in little holes or Neſts. And ſome have their Neſts above, others under Ground; and of thoſe that live under Ground, ſome make themſelves holes, others ſhelter themſelves in furrows made to their hands. Thoſe that live above Ground ſome live in Walls and Rocks; others make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves peculiar Houſes and Neſts. Again ſome keep themſelves in their Neſts all day, and at night come out to ſeek their food, and when it grows light they withdraw themſelves into their ſmal Cottages: others again do what they have to do by day light, and mew themſelves up when night doth come.</p>
                  <p>Again ſome Creatures are tame and gentle, others wild; and of the wild, ſome are alwaies ſo; but ſome may be and are tamed.</p>
                  <p>Living Creatures do alſo differ much in reſpect of their Voyce. For ſome utter a Vovce,
<note place="margin">The Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Creatures in reſpect of Voyce. Sound, Voyce, Speech, how they differ.</note> others have no Voyce at al. Thoſe that have a Noiſe or Voyce given them, have it to the End to expreſs their Paſſions or their Neceſſities. Now theſe three differ, Sound, Voyce, Speech. Sound is the moſt common of the three: for every found is not a Voyce, but only that ſound which is made in Creatures, by help of the Lungs, Cheſt, Weſand, and chiefly the Head ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which is the immediate Iuſtrument of the Voyce. Now ſome Voyces are expreſſed by Letters, and articulately diſtinct, other ſome cannot be expreſſed by Letters. The latter is ſimply called a Voyce, the former a Speech, which is proper to Man alone: for although brute Beaſts and irrational Creatures, can by Lowing, Squeaking, Barking, Neighing, Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing or any other way expreſs their Cheerfulneſs, Fear, Pain, Deſire: yet Man alone is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to expreſs all he feels in his mind, with a Voyce made up of Letters articulately diſtinct, and can communicate the ſame to others whom he hath been born to live with.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit, though there are many differences of Animals,
<note place="margin">Animals ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, others imperfect.</note> they may be reduced to certain kinds, as is apparent from what hath been ſaid. Some are imperfect, others perfect: and the perfect are Land Creatures, Fiſhes, and Fowls. And if we were to ſpeak of them all, we ſhould paſs from the Imperfect to the Perfect, til we came to Man, the Perfection of all Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creatures.</p>
                  <p>Among Living Creatures <hi>Zoophyta</hi> or Plant-animals hold the firſt place,
<note place="margin">Plant-An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals.</note> becauſe they are of a middle nature betwixt Plants and Animals, for in the ſhape and figure of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy they come near to Plants, but in their ſenſe of feeling, and a certain motion, they agree with Animals. For they have the ſenſe of feeling, and being touched do forcibly contract themſelves. And though they cannot paſs from place to place: yet are they endowed with a power of contracting and dilating themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe ſome ſtick alwaies in the Earth like Plants,
<note place="margin">The baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Tree.</note> as a Tree which grows in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Pudifeta,</hi> and ſeems to diſcern when things approach thereto. For when a Man or other Creature draws neer, it ſhrinks in its Boughs; and when they go away, it ſpreads them forth again; and therefore the Inhabitants cal it the Baſhful Tree.
<note place="margin">The ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Herb.</note> And <hi>Apollodorus</hi> the Scholar of <hi>Democritus</hi> writes of an Herb of like nature, which he therefore cals <hi>Aeſchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomene;</hi> becauſe if you put your hand to it, it would avoid the ſame by ſhrinking in its Leaves, as <hi>Scaliger Exercit.</hi> 181. <hi>ſect.</hi> 28. does write.</p>
                  <p>Alſo ſome cleave perpetually to the Stones or Sands; as the <hi>Pulmo Marinus,</hi> the Sea-Nettle, the Spunges, the <hi>Holothuria</hi> or prickly Fiſh.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mytuli</hi> or <hi>Limpins.</hi>
                     </note> And ſome ſtick ſo long to the roots and fibres of Trees, til they attain their juſt growth, as the <hi>Mytuli</hi> or <hi>Limpins,</hi> which are ſaid to grow on the Stalks of Sea-weed, and to ſtick exceeding faſt to them at firſt; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving attained their ful growth and juſt bigneſs they fall from their branches: but they are not generated as other Shel-fiſh are of themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Next, after theſe, and the moſt imperfect, are Creeping things which grow upon live Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, either without, as Crab-lice, Lice, Fleas, Ticks which trouble Dogs;
<note place="margin">A Tick.</note> but they ſay that they are not bred upon them, but they catch them as they hunt in the Woods; of which ſee <hi>Scaliger, Exercit.</hi> 195. <hi>ſect.</hi> 7. or within, and not only in their Guts, but in other parts alſo, for Phyſitians have obſerved that there is ſcarce a part in the whol Body wherin Worms do not breed.</p>
                  <pb n="392" facs="tcp:35070:113"/>
                  <p> Hereto belong thoſe Infects and ſmal Animals which are bred out of the Carkaſſes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creatures and out of Plants; as Wormes, Waſps, Gurgulions, Flies, Hornets, Coſs-Worms, Wood-lice, Moths, Glow-Worms, Wig-lice, Horſ-Flies, Graſs-Worms. of kin to which are Spiders, <hi>Phalangia, Tarantulae,</hi> Scorpions, and ſuch like.</p>
                  <p>Now among theſe kind of Creatures the moſt noble is the Bee and the Silk-worm;
<note place="margin">Bees and Silkworms</note> the former making moſt ſweet and uſeful Honey; the latter ſpinning Silk wherewith the great ones pride themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Then follow thoſe kind of Locuſts which <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt fed upon: Nor is there any need that we ſhould interpret the word <hi>Acrides</hi> ſo as to ſignifie the tops of Trees, or any Shrub, or river Crabs; ſeeing we are informed likewiſe by ancient Authors that ſome Nations did feed upon Locuſts, as <hi>Strabo in Lib.</hi> 16. <hi>in Deſcript. Arabiae;</hi> who alſo deſcribes the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how they caught them: and <hi>Pliny in Lib.</hi> 11. <hi>Cap.</hi> 29. who ſaie the Perſians delight in them: and in <hi>Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Cap.</hi> 30. that ſome People of <hi>Aethiopia</hi> have no other Meat but Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts, which he ſaies they ſalt and dry in the Smoak to that end: and among late writers <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardus in his Epiſtles</hi> writes, that at <hi>Fez</hi> and <hi>Morocco</hi> whol Cartloads of Locuſts are day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet to ſale.</p>
                  <p>Next to theſe come ſundry ſorts of Serpents, Frogs, Toads, Salamanders, Locuſts: To which are next in name and ſhape certain Sea-Inſects, Flies, <hi>Scolopendra,</hi> Caterpillars, Sea-Stars, and ſuch like.</p>
                  <p>After them march the Shel-fiſh of two kinds,
<note place="margin">Shel-Fiſh Purple.</note> for ſome have their ſhels open but twined ſtrangely about, ſuch as the Purple, and the Periwinkle, and an innumerable ſort of Shel-fiſh, whoſe ſhels are ſhaped like Turbants or Steeples; others ſhut their ſhels like two folding doors,
<note place="margin">Oyſters. Lobſtars.</note> that they cannot be opened without great force, ſuch are Oyſters and others of that kind, as Muſcles, Cockles &amp;c. of kin to which are Crabs, Lobſtars, Cray-fiſh, the Sea-Locuſt and ſuch like.</p>
                  <p>Next come the other kinds of Fiſhes ſmooth and without ſcales;
<note place="margin">Fiſh.</note> then the ſcaly, the Prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Sea, the River, the Lake-fiſh. Of Fiſhes (beſides others) read <hi>Scaliger, Eaeercit.</hi> 218. and <hi>Exercitat.</hi> 223.226.</p>
                  <p>After theſe come your <hi>Amphibia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Creatures which live in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and on the Land.</note> Creatures which live partly on Land and partly on the Water, as the Tortoiſe, the water Salamander, the <hi>Scincus,</hi> the Crocodile, the <hi>Cordylus,</hi> The <hi>Hippopotamus</hi> or River-Horſe, the Caſtor or Bever, the River-Crab, the Water-Moule and Rat. Amongſt which there is none that is partly made like a Fiſh and partly like a four-footed beaſt ſave the Bever.</p>
                  <p>After Fiſhes Birds muſt be explained.
<note place="margin">Birds.</note> Now every Animal that flies is not a Bird, but only that which hath blood in it, and is furniſhed with a Bil and Feathers. Hence Flies, Beetles, Bees, Hornets, and ſuch like are no Birds; as neither the Bat or Flitter-Mouſe, which is of a middle nature betwixt Birds and Mice, and may be termed the flying Mouſe.</p>
                  <p>Now there are ſundry differences of Birds,
<note place="margin">The Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</note> which <hi>Scaliger</hi> hath collected in <hi>Exercit.</hi> 227. In the firſt place come Swallows, which fly moſt ſwiftly of all others; of which alſo there is ſome difference. Theſe beeing commonly not fit to be eaten, neither can they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the winter find their own mear, <hi>viz.</hi> Flies and other Creatures that glide about in the Air: after the end of Summer when flies are gone, they fly from theſe parts of the world, <hi>Germany, France, England &amp;c.</hi> unto the ſhores of the Baltick Sea, and under huge high Rocks that hang over the Sea, they hang mutually embracing one another until the Spring return, and then when the Bird-Winds blow they return each to its own Country.</p>

<note place="margin">The Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisk or Cockatrice</note> Now that there is ſuch a Serpent called a Baſilisk, is apparent from the holy Scriptures, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 23. ver. 32. <hi>Eſay</hi> 11. ver. 8. and 14. verſe 29. and 15. verſe 5. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 8. verſe 7.

                  <p>But whether there be ſuch a Baſilisk as is hatched of the Egg of an old Cock is doubtful:
<note place="margin">Whether there be ſuch a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as a Baſilisk or Cockatrice.</note> Many count it for a fable: But it is commonly reported that there was once ſuch an one at <hi>Vienna</hi> in <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and that the Picture thereof is extant on the wall of a certain houſe; as alſo at <hi>Bafil</hi> and <hi>Zwiccavia,</hi> as <hi>George Agricola</hi> relates in his Book <hi>de Animalib. ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneis.</hi> But there is a remarkable ſtory which <hi>Joh.

<note place="margin">A memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſtory of a Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisk or coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>katrice.</note> At <hi>Warſovia</hi> in <hi>Poland</hi> it fel out in the Year, 1587. That the Son of a certain Sword-Cutler, and the Daughter of a neighboring Citizen, being both of them five years old apiece, with others their equals in years, not enduring to be out of action, after the manner of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren they would needs paſs the time in ſports, and ſeek hiding holes where their play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellows ſhould not find them out. There was not far from the place where they played, a Cellar left deſolate by reaſon the Houſe had been burnt which ſtood over it thirty years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; into which by help of the half-rotten ſtairs one might make a ſhift to creep down. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſaid Cellar the two foreſaid children going down, they fel down on the lower ſtairs and died. When Supper-time was at hand, the two Mothers each enquiring for her child could hear no tidings thereof: And therefore the Wife of the Sword-Cutler ſent her Maid our, who having long ſought them, at laſt ſpied them upon the ſtairs of the Cellar as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, and preſently ſhe cried out, See where they lie. But neither of the children ſtirring at al, ſhe began to ſuſpect they were fallen aſleep, and with a loud voyce called by name, ſomtimes the Boy, and ſomtimes the Girl; to ſee if by this means ſhe might waken them. But when ſhe ſaw (though ſhe cried til ſhe were hoarſe) it was to no purpoſe, ſhe alſo went down into the Cellar, thinking to awaken them by jogging and pulling: But ſee what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, preſently alſo ſhe fals down by the children and dies. Her Miſtriſs ſaw the Maid when ſhe went down into the Cellar, and perceiving that ſhe ſtaid over long, al amazed ſhe ran unto the Cellar, and ſees the Maid lie on the ground with the children: Therefore ſhe alſo fals to cal aloud ſomtimes upon the Maid, then upon the children. And when ſhe had done thus alſo in vain, and none of the three did either anſwer or ſtir, ſhe concluded they were dead. Preſently a rumor flies about the Town, and the Citizens come running, but know not what to do til the Magiſtrates and Council of the City being made acquainted therewith, did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that their bodies ſhould be drawn out with long hooks, ſuch as they uſe to pul down houſes in the time of fires. They being drawn out were found ſwollen like Drums, their lips and tongues were ſwollen, their color was brown, their eyes ſtuck out of their eye holes as big as half Eggs. There came to behold this ſad Spectacle the Palatine N. and an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent man the Kings chief Phyſitian, named <hi>Benedictus.</hi> He conjectured that ſome moſt venemous Serpent did lurk in that deſolate Cellar, by whoſe deadly breath the air incloſed therein was infected, and that the weak nature of man could not bear the ſame; and that therefore moſt like it was that the children and maiden were thereby killed. Alſo that it might be that a Baſilisk or Cockatrice might there lie hid, which Naturaliſts ſay is bred of a Cocks Egg hatched by a Toad, whoſe venom is ſo powerful that whoever looks upon his eyes dies forthwith. Being demanded how the certainty might be known, he made anſwer, That ſomebody muſt be ſent into the Cellar covered round with looking Glaſſes, the right ſides of the Glaſſes being outwards: For the Baſilisk if he ſaw but his own picture or image would preſently die. There were at the ſame time two Malefactors which three daies after were to be executed, the one being a Polander, the other a Sileſian called <hi>Jobannes Jaure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</hi> To them it was proffered, That he that would go down into the Cellar and hunt out the Serpent ſhould eſcape his allotted puniſhment. <hi>John</hi> preſently accepted the condition: And therefore he was covered al his body over with Leather, and Glaſſes were tied before his eyes, which he could wel ſee through; in one hand he had an iron Rake, in the other a ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:35070:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>Link; finally, to al parts of his body before and behind Looking-glaſſes were faſtened. Thus furniſhed he entred into the Cellar, more than two thouſand people looking on. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had for above an hour ſearched al the holes and corners of the Cellar, and could find no Serpent, he called upon them to throw him down another link into the Cellar: for there was another Cellar cloſe by, but the way was ſo ſtopt up with rubbiſh that he could not get in; but he would now ſee to clear the way, and ſearch there alſo. And as he was doing that, he chanced to turn his eyes to the left ſide, and unawares eſpied the long lookt for Beaſt in the ſhape of an Hen, lying dead in a certain hole of the wall: which when he had declared by a ſhout to them that were without, the Kings Doctor had him with his Rake to bring it out into the light, which he preſently did before al the people. The Doctor preſently judged that it was a Baſilisk or Cockatrice. It was as big as an ordinary Hen, its head was like that of a Turky-cock, his Comb reſembling a Crown was ſprinkled partly with yellow, and partly with blue ſpots, and his Chotters hanging under his Throat were of the ſame color. His Back was ſtarred with many eminent ſpots reſembling Toads eyes, the colors of virulent Beaſts being every where ſprinkled between, but chiefly yellow: The ſame colors alſo were on the outſide of his Wings: Under his Wings he was al yellow, as alſo under his belly, where nevertheleſs blue and green and other wonderful colors were intermingled. He had long Legs like the Legs of a Cock, and yellow as a Quince-Apple; before and behind theſe two Legs there grew out other two Legs like the Legs of a Toad in ſhortneſs and ſhape. His back; lower it was yellow, and in the loweſt part like a Toad in color. More may be ſeen concerning the Baſilisk, in the foreſaid Book of <hi>Pincierus,</hi> and the place fore-allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, There are four-footed Beaſts, which come neareſt to a Man both in the parts of their bodies, and the faculties of their ſouls. And among theſe are ſuch as chew the Cud, that is to ſay, the meat which they have eaten, and is ſlipt into one Cavity of their ſtomach, they fetch it up again through their throat and chew it over again, and ſo tranſmit it into the other cavity of their ſtomach, better ground and prepared for further digeſtion: For what Nature hath denied them in the want of upper Teeth, that ſhe makes amends for by this double chewing.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, all theſe Creatures have coverings given them inſtead of cloaths; for ſome have hairs, ſome more, ſome ſewer; others have briſtles, others wooll, and ſome furr. Again, ſome have ſolid, others cloven hoofs.</p>
                  <p>The loweſt and moſt imperfect kind of theſe Creatures are Moles, Mice, Marmots, which <hi>Scaliger</hi> deſcribes <hi>Exercit.</hi> 203. The more perfect are the ſorts of Weezels, Hedg-hogs, Cats, Dogs (of which ſee <hi>Lipſius</hi> in his Centuries of Epiſtles, <hi>Cent.</hi> 1. <hi>ad Belgas Epiſt.</hi> 44.) Wolves, Sheep, Goats, Rams, Hares, Foxes, Aſſes, Hogs, Oxen, Apes, Harts, Bears, Elephants (of which ſee <hi>Scaliger, Exercit,</hi> 204. And <hi>Lipſius</hi> in <hi>Epiſt. miſcell. Ep.</hi> 50.) Horſes, Elks. Cammels, Loeprads, Rhinocerots, Unicorns, and others; finally, the King as it were of al bruit Beaſts, the Lyon.</p>
                  <p>Only I muſt ſpeak ſomwhat of the Unicorn,
<note place="margin">Whether there be ſuch a heaſt as the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn?</note> of which ſundry men are of ſeveral minds. <hi>Ambroſe Parey</hi> in the 20. <hi>B.</hi> of his <hi>Chyrurgacy, cap.</hi> 39. where he diſputes largely of this matter, after he hath brought the Narrations of ſome Authors touching this Beaſt, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves that they agree not one with another, he concludes at laſt, That the word <hi>

                  <p>But in very deed this is an abſurd Opinion of his; it is alſo a raſh thing to deny that which ſo many learned men affirm; and alſo the holy Scripture it ſelf, <hi>Job</hi> 39. verſe 9. <hi>Eſay,</hi> 34. verſe 7. <hi>Deuter.</hi> chap. 33. ver. 17. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 22. ver. 22. and <hi>Pſalm</hi> 29. ver. 6, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23. ver. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This rather is apparent from thoſe manifold differing Narrations and Deſcriptions,
<note place="margin">there are five kinds of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corns.</note> That there is not only one Creature that beats a ſingle Horn but divers: For in the places cited, the Unicorn is made to be a Beaſt ſwift of foot, fit to be hunted; which is not true of the Rhinoceror, which is a thick beaſt with ſhort Legs.

                  <p>Now a Man (as other living Creatures) conſiſts of a Body and a Soul. We ſhal ſpeak of his Soul in the firſt place.
<note place="margin">the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial parts of Man.</note> And ſeeing every Soul may be conſidered under a twofold notion; firſt as a Principle and one part of a Compound, or as the Form of the Body; Secondly as the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe of al operations: We wil treat thereof alſo under both reſpects; and in the firſt place we wil conſider how the Rational Soul ſtands in reference to the Body of Man: and afterwards what operations it doth work.</p>
                  <pb n="396" facs="tcp:35070:115"/>
                  <p> No ſound Philoſopher denies the Rational Soul to be the form of a man.
<note place="margin">Whether the Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Soul be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Form of a Man.</note> But ſeeing there is a twofold Form, one which is called the informing Form, which is the Principle and one half of the Compound, and gives the thing its ſpecifical being, and as a difference diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes it from al other things: another which is called the aſſiſting Form, which does not give the ſpecifical being to a thing, but is added to a thing already conſtituted in its ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal being, for the performance of ſome nobler operations, which of it ſelf it cannot perform; (ſuch a form as the Marriner is to the Ship, who gives not the Eſſence to the Saip, but is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned thereto after it is perfect in its Eſſence, to cauſe it to ſail, which it could not do of it ſelf:) The Queſtion is, Whether the Rational ſoul be the informing form of a Man, and the half of his Eſſence? or only an aſſiſtant form, which is added to a man after he is perfect, and hath his ſpecifick form to cauſe in him ſome more noble operation, viz. Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Avenrois</hi> was of Opinion that the Cogitative Faculty (by him ſo called and diſtinguiſhed from the Fancy) was the form of a Man, and by vertue thereof a Man became a particular ſort of Living Creature; but that the Rational Soul was only an aſſiſtant form. But moſt of the Latines hold the Rational Soul to be the true form of a Man, and one of his conſtituting parts; which Opinion we retain as the more true: For if the Rational Soul were not the informing form of a Man, he could not rightly be called Rational; even as a Ship, though the Sailet therein do reaſon, cannot be called Intelligent or Rational, which were abſurd. Or thus, which is the ſame in effect, that whereby any thing does primarily operate, is the form of the thing to which the operation is attributed. But to Man as Man Underſtanding is attributed: Therefore the Intelligent Soul is the form of Mans Body. Nor does that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſatisfie, when they ſay, That the Underſtanding is joyned to a Man by the Phantaſms or Images of the Internal Senſes: For the Phantaſms are to the Underſtanding as colors to the Eye. As therefore neither the Color, nor the Subject of colors do ſee; ſo neither the Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſms, nor the ſubject of the Phantaſms do underſtand; but rather are themſelves under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. Thus therefore we conclude: That whereby one thing differs ſpecifically from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the form thereof. But by the Rational Soul a Man differs from alother living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; <hi>that</hi> therefore is the form of a Man. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> alſo ſeems to have been of the ſame mind, as appears out of the 2. <hi>de Anima, cap.</hi> 1. <hi>t.</hi> 7.8. <hi>cap</hi> 2. <hi>t.</hi> 24.25.26. <hi>cap.</hi> 4, <hi>t.</hi> 36.37. as <hi>Zabarella</hi> does ſhew at large in his chap. 7. <hi>de Mente Humana.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the Explication of this Queſtion another Queſtion may eaſily be anſwered,
<note place="margin">Whether there be one Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Soul in all Men.</note> viz. <hi>Whether the Rational Soul be one in number in all men? or there be in every one a peculiar Soul?</hi> Some that hold the Rational Soul to be an aſſiſtant form, do hold that it is not mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied according to the number of Perſons, but that in al Man-kind there is one only, which is the cauſe of Underſtanding in al Men. But in very deed this Opinion is many waies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the truth: For every informing Form, ſuch as we have already ſhewed the Rational Soul to be, is multiplied according to the multiplication of particular perſons. And if there were only one Soul in al Men, al ſhould be but one; for they ſhould have but one Form. Moreover, the operations, or underſtandings, or ſecond acts, are multiplied in Men according to the multitude of Individuals; and my Underſtanding is one, and thine another, a third Mans another. Therefore the Soul the firſt act is manifold: For the diverſity of operations depends upon the diverſity of Forms. Finally, in one and the ſame Underſtanding there would be contrary operations: for one man is of one Opinion, another of another about the ſame thing.</p>
                  <p>And ſince we have averred the Rational Soul to be the Form of Man,
<note place="margin">Whether the Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſoul be immortal?</note> here ariſes a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, whether or no it be immortal? or, <hi>Whether it can without periſhing be ſeparated from the Body?</hi> As for us, according to the Tenets of our Religion we hold, that our Soul is immortal; and the Immortality of the Soul is counted one of the Hinges upon which Chriſtian Religion turns. But whether or no it may be proved by Philoſophical Reaſons, and what <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Opinion was concerning the ſame, hath been carefully enquired into by many.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place,
<note place="margin">A thing two waies immortal.</note> this we muſt hold, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> hath it, <hi>Exercit.</hi> 61. <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. and <hi>Exercit.</hi> 307. <hi>Sect.</hi> 20. that only God is truly immortal, and incorruptible. And therefore a thing may be ſaid to be immortal two waies; either becauſe it cannot periſh at al, becauſe it is moſt ſimple, and hath its Eſſence of it ſelf, and depends upon none; and ſuch is only God, and in reſpect o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> him al other things may be called corruptible: For although Angels and the Rational Soul, which are ſaid to be immortal after the ſecond way, are never actually corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, have no contrary, and are ſeparate from their ſubject; yet ſeeing they are not without Cauſe, and they have not the Cauſe of their Eſſence from themſelves, but are by another,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:35070:115"/>and by another may naturally come to be no more. For every dependent may be changed by that on which it depends, if it be a voluntary principle, and at the pleaſure of the firſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple it may be depoſed from its Eſſence wherein it was thereby inſtated. Now ſome things are not corrupted, becauſe the Creator wil not have them ſo to be, who hath created nothing in them contrary, whereby they might be corrupted, nor hath plunged them ſo in matter, as they can neither be, nor operate without it. And that the Soul of man is of this kind, and that it may be ſeparated from the body without corruption, <hi>Marſilius Ficinus</hi> endeavors to prove by many Arguments, <hi>de Immortal. Anim.

                  <p>We ſhal briefly thus determine the matter: Every thing is known by its operations, and every form diſcovers it ſelf what it is by its operations. And therefore ſince the actions of Man are ſo noble that they cannot proceed from a mortal ſubſtance wholly plunged in the matter; it is plainly to be hence gathered, that the rational Soul from which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed is immortal and ſeparable from the matter: for the Underſtanding abſtracts and ſevers things from the matter, and knows without conditions of matter, without quantity, without figure; it underſtands things tree from matter; it is not offended with the multitude and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency of the Objects as the Senſe is; it can conceive things infinite; and although it knows very many things, it may alwaies know yet more, and can encreaſe a number though never ſo great; and not only knows a thing, but alſo knows it ſelf, and underſtands that it under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands what it doth underſtand; it can wil and refuſe, hath an unſatiable appetite of eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, knowledg, happineſs; which becauſe it cannot be ſatisfied in this life, it is credible that it ſhal enjoy another condition wherein thoſe appetites ſhal be ſatisfied; alſo it performs ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations without corporeal Inſtruments.

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus far we have ſhewed how the rational Soul is reſerred to the body of man: we are now to explain the nature thereof, as it is a principle of operation. Now <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> expreſſes the nature thereof, in this reſpect, in <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Anima,</hi> when he ſaith;
<note place="margin">The ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſoul is unmix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> that the rational ſoul is unmixed. Now the Soul muſt be unmixed two manner of waies: firſt, in reſpect of the Objects, ſo that it muſt not have their nature in its eſſence, but only a power to receive them. For becauſe it ought to know the Objects, and it knows them by receiving them, it muſt needs of it ſelf be free, unaffected and unmixed, ſince nothing receives that which it hath already; and that which is within hinders the ingreſs of another. And this immixture (that I may ſo ſpeak) is common to the rational Soul with the Senſes, which alſo have not their Objects actually in themſelves, but only a power to receive them: ſave that the ſenſes are reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively uanffected and unmixed, <hi>viz.</hi> with ſome ſort of being, as the ſight (for example ſake) within colour, ſeeing they are not converſant about every kind of being: but the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Soul is quite free from the natures of al other things, as being directed to al things, and its office being to underſtand all things.</p>
                  <p>Again, the rational Soul is after a peculiar manner free from Organs, nor mixed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; that is to ſay, when it operates by underſtanding or willing, it makes no uſe of the body, but performs thoſe functions without it. For, inaſmuch as to perform the actions which are done in and by the body there is required a certain temper of the qualities (ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every body any waies tempered and diſpoſed doth not receive every thing) and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently alſo a certain Organ; ſince the ſeveral parts of the body have ſeveral temperaments; and the rational Soul is not tied to any temper of the firſt Qualities, nor any waies affected by the qualities, not is there any proper Organ thereof in the body: we muſt doubtleſs therefore beleeve that it depends not upon the body, in reſpect of its operations, nor that it is after any ſuch manner mixed therewith.</p>
                  <p>From this other immixture we may gather, what kind of operations thoſe of the foul are.
<note place="margin">The Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſoul are inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical.</note> For ſince in its acting it is no way mixed with the body, and the actions of the body have nothing to do with the action of the mind: it is manifeſt that the Underſtanding and the Wil are inorganical faculties, and act of themſelves; ſo that to underſtand and to wil, are actions proper to the mind; nor doth the mind underſtand by the body, or any Organ of the body, as by a medium wherewith it acts. The Soul indeed hath need of a Phantaſm;
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:35070:116"/>ſince the Soul while it is in the Body never underſtands without a Phantaſm, <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, cap.</hi> 7. but it uſeth the ſame not as an Organ, but as an object; becauſe an intelligible matter muſt be preſented to the mind by the Senſes. And therefore if any have affirmed that the actions of the mind are organical, and that the rational Soul doth uſe the help of the Brain, Spirits, and Senſes, as corporeal Organs, that is not to be admitted ſave in this ſence, viz. that the ſoul doth not underſtand while it is in the body, without the foregoing operation of the Organs of the body, and before its own operation: or that in ſubordinate operation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> it uſes an organ, and needs the brain, and ſpirit: but while it is in working of it ſelf, or while it purely underſtands, and purely wils, it needs them not, nor doth it underſtand by organs, but this mind only is the ſubject of underſtanding, as alſo of the act of willing, which out barbarous Authors cal volition, by a new neceſſary and fitting word, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaies, <hi>Exercit.</hi> 307. <hi>ſect.</hi> 3. and <hi>ſect.</hi> 9. and though when the Brain is hurt Reaſon is depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: yet that is done for no other cauſe, but that the adminiſtring or the ſubordinate facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which are organical and depend upon the conſtitution of the Brain, are hurt.</p>
                  <p>And although the rational Soul be furniſhed with all thoſe faculties which we have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto attributed to the vegetative and ſenſitive Soul:
<note place="margin">The rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Soul hath two proper fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.</note> yet hath it beſides two proper and peculiar faculties, whereby it excels Plants and other Animals; the Underſtanding, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we apprehend and know things; and the Wil, whereby we are carried out to ſuch things we underſtand to be good. And there is a manifeſt difference betwixt theſe faculties, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is one thing to know, another thing to deſire the thing known; and theſe two are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by a ſeveral way of working; the former by paſſion and reception of the ſpecies, ſo that the things may be carried to the mind: but the latter by following, ſo that the mind is carried and drawn to the object. Finally the diverſity of the object ſevers the power of knowing from the power of willing, ſeeing we know things as <hi>Entia</hi> or Beings; but we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire them as good.</p>
                  <p>The Underſtanding is therefore actually none of all the other Beings that are:
<note place="margin">the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</note> yet it can ſpiritually receive and know them all. And although in reſpect of its eſſence it is one and the ſame, as being an inorganical part of the ſoul, which hath no variety from the Organs: yet according to certain reſpects it is divided into ſundry differences. And in the firſt place <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> cals one the active Underſtanding, another the paſſive, ſuppoſing that in our mind beſides that which is apt to be made every thing, viz. by underſtanding, and which is as it were the matter, there is ſomwhat in the nature of a form which is apt to make all things, that is to ſay, actually intelligible.</p>
                  <p>But what the active Underſtanding or the <hi>Intellectus agens</hi> is,
<note place="margin">What the active un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is.</note> is an obſcure point in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy. Very many hold that the active underſtanding is God, or ſome Angel who is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant to a man. But theſe mens opinion ſeems to differ both from <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and the Truth. For the Intent of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (in <hi>Lib. de anima</hi>) is to ſpeak of the humane underſtanding, and he plainly in <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de anima, chap.</hi> 5. cals the active underſtanding a difference in the Soul. Again, that underſtanding which proceeds from the <hi>Intellectus agens</hi> or active Intellective faculty is in our own power, nor doth it proceed immediately from God or any Intelligence or Angel. Moreover ſeeing God when he firſt made our underſtanding could put as much light into it as he pleaſed, there is no need that he ſhould alwaies be aſſiſting the ſame, like ſome Judg at the Aſſiſes, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaies in <hi>Exercit.</hi> 307. <hi>ſect.</hi> 19. But the active underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is (according to the opinion of the Philoſopher) a difference of our Soul not informing, which of things potentially intelligible makes things actually underſtood. For as to a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural affect there is required an agent of the ſame kind, and for artificial effects there is need of Art: ſo for the work of the mind, viz. Underſtanding, an agent is required, not ſeparate from the Soul, but which is a part, or ſome difference of the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>And although this Agent Underſtanding ſeems to ſome unneceſſary, who would have it baniſhed out of natural Philoſophy: yet it ſeems altogether neceſſary to hold an Agent Underſtanding, for this cauſe, ſeeing every thing that is done is done by ſomwhat and in ſomwhat, ſo that <hi>that by,</hi> and that <hi>wherein,</hi> do differ. Univerſals are made in the paſſive underſtanding, therefore there muſt be beſides it another power to make Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſals. For ſince every Patient requires ſome Agent, and nothing in nature brings it ſelf from power to act; and our underſtanding is conſtituted in a poſſibility actually to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and by receiving intelligible objects doth actually ſuffer: cleer it is, that holding a paſſive underſtanding, we muſt withall hold an active, and taking away the latter we deny the former. The Agent underſtanding therefore is for this cauſe neceſſary, that it may do or make all things, viz. as to their intellectual being, that is, that it may transfer the object from one order to another. For ſeting the Object or Phantaſm is material, and ſo under an
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:35070:116"/>oppoſite condition to the intellective faculty, which is abſtract from all matter; it cannot be by the ſaid faculty underſtood, unleſs it be made proportionate thereunto, viz. abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and immaterial: now this cannot be done ſave by an abſtract Virtue, and an Intelligent nature.</p>
                  <p>From whence it is apparent, that it is the Office of the active underſtanding to act,
<note place="margin">The Office of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</note> that is to draw from power to act, and of things potentially intelligible to make things actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intelligible. This Office of the underſtanding <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> expreſſes by the analogy it bears to Art, Nature, Habit, Light. For it is as it were the eye and ſight of the mind, and it is to the Phantaſms, as light to colours. For it illuſtrates the Phantaſms, being inveloped with material conditions, which like darkneſs do hinder their being underſtood, ſo as they may put on the nature of things intelligible, and may be diffuſed to the paſſive underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: even as Colours by means of Light do ſend forth a Picture of themſelves unto the ſight: yet this illuſtration of the Phantaſms is not performed formally, ſo that any quality is imprinted upon them; nor objectively only, but effectively; becauſe the Agent under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding like external light by imparting its Ray yet doth actively elevate the Phantaſms, to the production of an Intelligible ſpecies; nor is the Agent Underſtanding requiſite only in reſpect of the object, but it hath alſo another office, viz. in reference to the paſſive underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that it may produce therein the act of underſtanding, repreſenting thereto an object in a ſpecies intelligible, which it performes when together with the illuſtrated Phantaſm it produces a ſpecies of the thing to be underſtood, into the paſſive underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>Whence we may collect, upon what and how the Agent underſtanding doth act.
<note place="margin">The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</note> For it is requiſite in reſpect of both action, v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>z. that it may act upon the Phantaſms, and upon the paſſive underſtanding. But it acts upon theſe in a different manner; for it is joyned to the Phancaſms before Intellection, and indeed while they are yet in the Fancy, where illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating them it becomes their form, whereby they are made a moving object of the paſſive underſtanding: afterwards, the adjoyned Phantaſms being illuminated, it acts upon the paſſive underſtanding, by producing therein an intelligible ſpecies or repreſentation, and by conſequent the act it ſelf of underſtanding: But the Agent underſtanding it ſelf as it is an Agent doth not underſtand; ſince it doth not receive the intelligible ſpeces or notions, though it produce them, nor is in aptitude to underſtand; but the act of underſtanding is in the Paſſive Intellect, as in its ſubject. This therefore is called formally the Intellect; the other only effectively, becauſe it makes the underſtanding or Intellection.</p>
                  <p>The Paſſive underſtanding is as it were the ſubject and matter,
<note place="margin">The paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what it is.</note> whereon the intelligible ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are imprinted; and therefore 'tis called Patient and Paſſive, becauſe it ſuffers by recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſpecies, through means of the Phantaſms. It is alſo called <hi>Intellectus poſſibilis,</hi> the poſſible underſtanding, and the mind in power; becauſe it may be made all things, though it is actually none of them.</p>
                  <p>And here in the firſt place we muſt remember that the paſſive underſtanding is indeed in reſpect of the object a paſſive power; ſeeing it acts upon no other thing: but compared with the Intellection it is a power, both active, inaſmuch as it works Intellection; and alſo paſſive, inaſmuch as it receives the ſaid Intellection. For an immanent action muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the ſame power by which it is produced.</p>
                  <p>Moreover we muſt obſerve how that it is to be underſtood that <hi>the underſtanding when it underſtands, is made all things,</hi> which in the moſt elegant words of <hi>Scaliger, Exercit.</hi> 307. <hi>ſect.</hi> 6. thus we explain. <hi>In the firſt place</hi> (quoth he) <hi>I deny that the Philoſopher ſaith, that our underſtanding is all things eſſentially or formally as they uſe to ſay. But it is all things, ſubjectively, even as the firſt matter is, which is not made the Eſſence of an Horſe under the form of an Horſe: but it remains that which it was, a certain ſubſtance, of which and the form this thing is made. But the information of the underſtanding is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another manner: for it is not a meer poſſibility, as the firſt matter, which may be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to be actually this or that by the form. But it is our form ſubſtantial, ſeparable, incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, eternal; of which as a ſubject eſſentially perfect, and the ſpecies which it receives, is made the formed intellect, not another from it ſelf; ſave as</hi> Caeſar <hi>being learned differs from himſelf unlearned, by reception of accidental ſpecies. It is not therefore made the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding ſimply, nor is it made the ſpecies it ſelf, but under the ſpecies.</hi> So far <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſo much ſhal ſuffice to have ſaid of the firſt difference of the underſtanding:
<note place="margin">The Agent &amp; paſſive Intellect do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally differ.</note> where this again is to be obſerved: that the Agent and paſſive underſtanding are not really and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially diſtinguiſhed, but only reſpectively; ſince two internal forms are not knit together by new accidents, and to the receiving and effecting of an immanent action (ſuch as under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:35070:117"/>is) ſuch a principle is requiſite as is eſſentially one. And therefore we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that the Eſſence of the Agent and Paſſive Intellect is al one, and that one Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in Eſſence, inaſmuch as it makes things intelligible, or illuſtrates the Phantaſms, and repoſits them in the Paſſive, is Agent; but inaſmuch as it is the ſubject receiving the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract Phantaſms, it is called the Patient.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the Differences reckoned up,
<note place="margin">the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in habit:</note> there are alſo other notions of the Underſtanding, as the Underſtanding in habit, and the Underſtanding in act; which indeed are not divers Underſtandings, but one that hath divers degrees, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> cals differences. For the Intellect in habit is that which hath the Phantaſm reſerved in the Phantaſie; and it is in a more perfect degree than the poſſible Intellect: for this is in aptitude to the firſt act, the other is in aptitude to the ſecond, or to the operation, and therefore is very like to him that hath ſcience, and does not contemplate. Howbeit <hi>Zabarella</hi> ſeems to think otherwiſe in this point, <hi>Lib. de ſpecieb. Intellect. cap.</hi> 8. after this manner; That our mind is firſt born rude and unfit for the knowledg of things; but afterwards by multiplied acts of Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it acquires a certain greater ability and aptitude to underſtand things, ſo that it can without any labor when it pleaſeth turn to the Fancy, and preſently underſtand a thing: and that the Underſtanding being furniſhed with this ability is called the Intellect in habit. But when the Paſſive Underſtanding does actually operate, and actually perceives the thing offered, it is called the Intellect in act.</p>
                  <p>Finally,
<note place="margin">the ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative and practical underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding:</note> the Underſtanding is diſtinguiſhed into Speculative and Practical; by which terms nevertheleſs there are neither made two faculties of underſtanding, nor are the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences and degrees of the ſame Faculty intimated; but each Faculty of the Intellect is ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Theoretick or Speculative, the Underſtanding properly ſo called, and by the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical the Will. For ſeeing the Underſtanding in reſpect of the apprehenſion of a thing, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in reſpect of Affirmation and Negation of that which is true or falſe, cannot be otherwiſe called than Speculative; of neceſſity that difference muſt ariſe in reſpect of a third attribute of the Practical Underſtanding, viz. Deſiring and avoiding, which belong to the Will.</p>
                  <p>The operation of the Underſtanding to which al the Functions of its degrees do tend,
<note place="margin">the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding:</note> is Intellection, which is not one and the ſame thing with the Intelligible Species, but really differs therefrom, and is more rightly defined by reception of Intelligible ſpecies (in which ſenſe it is by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> termed a kind of Paſſion, 3. <hi>de Anima, cap.</hi> 4.) and paſſing judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereon. For the Intellect exerciſes a twofold operation about its object; the former of which is ſimple Apprehenſion and Cognition; but the other is termed Compoſition and Diviſion, and it is compound Apprehenſion and Judgment, which conſiſts in Aſſent and Diſſent.
<note place="margin">Intellecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold:</note> And hence Intellection is ſaid to be twofold; Simple when the Intellect knows that which is ſimple and incomplex, as they cal it: and Compound, when it knows a propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition true or falſe.</p>
                  <p>The Object of Intellection which at once moves and terminates the intellect, is a Being or thing Univerſally taken, comprehending things material and immaterial. To which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs ſome conditions muſt needs be added. And in the firſt place Univerſality: For that a Being may be perceived by the Intellect, it muſt be abſtracted from al ſingularities. Then Secondly, Intelligibility, or abſtraction from the conditions of matter. Thirdly, Verity. This Object as it is fitted and proportioned to the Mind by the Agent Intellect, is called an Intelligible Species; as that which the Senſes receive is called a Senſible Species.</p>
                  <p>Now the Intelligible Species are illuminated Phantaſms,
<note place="margin">Intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpecies what they are.</note> that is to ſay, freed from the conditions of matter, and by the Agent Intellect imprinted upon the Paſſive, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpiritual and indiviſible accidents: For a Subſtance is not received into the Senſe, as <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger</hi> would have it, <hi>Exercit.</hi> 303. <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. but only accidents. And therefore only accidents do make the Species or Image in the Intellect; amongſt which are both time and place, and the finite Unity of quantity, which being removed by the operation of the Intellect it ſelf, there remains an Univerſal ſubſtantial Species: As if you ſee a man armed and diſguiſed; firſt you apprehend the Arms the diſguiſe, and afterward having removed them you conceive the Man himſelf.</p>
                  <p>And ſince we have juſt now aſſerted,
<note place="margin">Whether or no, and how the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars?</note> That ſuch things as are offered to the Intellect, and received by it, muſt be ſeparated from matter and al particular conditions, the Queſtion is; How the Intellect underſtands particular things, or whether it be capable only of univerſals? We anſwer, That the Mind of Man does alſo know particulars. For ſince al knowing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties being ſubordinate, are ſo joyned that the end of one action is the beginning of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:35070:117"/>and what ever is known by the Inferior Faculty is alſo known by the Superior; and the Senſes and Fancy know particular things, the Mind alſo muſt needs know the ſame. And by means of this knowledg it comes to paſs that a man is able to compare a ſingular with an univerſal, and that the mind can frame ſingular propoſitions, collect univerſals from them, and frequently correct the judgment of the Senſes about ſingular things, viz. As oft as they (by reaſon of an evil diſpoſition of the Object) do commit any error. Now the manner of knowing ſingulars is alſo by accidents; becauſe out of the proper ſingular accidents we draw out a notion or phantaſm proper to the ſingle Objects; even as out of the notions proper to a ſort we draw out a notion proper to the ſame ſort.</p>
                  <p>Intellection is commonly divided into direct and reflex. It is termed direct,
<note place="margin">Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Direct.</note> when we on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know ſomwhat, and make no further enquiry, but the Species gives a ſtop to the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, as when the Underſtanding ſtaies at the firſt apprehenſion of a Man, an Ox, an Horſe, &amp;c. but that is termed Reflex, or doubled and reciprocal as it were,
<note place="margin">Reflex.</note> whereby the Mind knows it ſelf, viz. That it knows, and hath the power to know and Underſtand; or when we underſtand the Intellection it ſelf, and the Underſtanding knows that it is an Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, viz. That it ſelf is an Eſſence and an unmixt one, and knows that it underſtands, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that it is able to know it underſtands.</p>
                  <p>And here you muſt obſerve, what it is to abſtract.
<note place="margin">What it is to abſtract</note> Now Abſtraction is the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one thing from another, and the apprehenſion and underſtanding of one thing without the apprehenſion or underſtanding of others. For in Abſtraction al things are not known which are in a thing, but that only which is abſtracted: for examples ſake; To abſtract the Living Creature from the Horſe, is to conſider only the Nature of a living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in general, not regarding the particular Nature of an Horſe.</p>
                  <p>Finally,
<note place="margin">The Will what it is.</note> The Will (that we may alſo ſpeak briefly thereof) is the other Faculty of a Rational Soul, whereby we follow or avoid ſuch things as are known by the Underſtanding; or (as <hi>Scaliger</hi> hath it, <hi>Exercit.</hi> 307. <hi>S.</hi> 3.) The Will is the Underſtanding extended to the having or doing what it knows. Others cal it the Rational Appetite. For as after the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Senſe there follows a Senſitive Appetite; ſo after the knowledg of the Mind an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite follows proper thereto, which to difference it from the former, they cal it <hi>Voluntas,</hi> the Will; and that this Rational Appetite differs from the Senſible is hereby apparent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are frequently at enmity one againſt another.</p>
                  <p>The Object of the Will, is <hi>Good</hi> known by the Underſtanding and preſented to the Wil,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Will. Its actions twofold.</hi> 1. <hi>Drawn out.</hi> 2 <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</hi>
                     </note> and the contrary Evil: Hence it follows the Good, and ſhuns the Evil. The Actions of this Faculty are to Will or Deſire, and to Nill or Refuſe. Now the Actions of the Will are twofold; <hi>Drawn out,</hi> and <hi>Commanded.</hi> The <hi>Drawn out,</hi> are thoſe which the Will puts forth and performs of it ſelf, and not by the inferior powers. The <hi>Commanded</hi> are thoſe which the Will commands and enjoyns the inferior Faculties to perform. Now the Will hath command over the Locomotive Faculty, and the Senſitive Appetite: for at the word and command of the Mind and Will we move and reſt. But the command which the Will ought to have over the Senſitive Appetite is much weakened by ſin, and that ſame har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony diſturbed betwixt the two Appetites; ſo that many times the Senſitive Appetite caſts off the command of the Will and right Reaſon, and that ſaying becomes true:
<q>
                        <hi>Hurry'd the Coach-man is, and the Coach away, by the Horſes.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Will hath no command over the Vegetative Faculty, and it acts meerly naturally, nor can we be nouriſhed or grow according to our own will and pleaſure.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>NOW the Soul of Man, ſince it is the Rule (in a manner) of al things living, as <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger, Exercit.</hi> 102. <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. hath it; it muſt alſo of neceſſity have the moſt noble Body of al; which ought now to be deſcribed, as the Rule of all the reſt. But ſince the dignity thereof, yea, and the neceſſity that there is of its knowledg, hath ſtirred up many to ſeek the knowledg thereof, ſo many Volums are written concerning the ſame (wherein both its parts are accurately deſcribed, and the uſes of al of them laid open) that it is an impoſſible thing to Epitomize the ſame. To name a few Authors: <hi>Galen</hi> hath written many Books of this ſubject; of the Diſſection of the Muſcles, Nerves, Veins, Arteries, vocal Inſtruments, Womb, of the Bones, of Anatomical Adminiſtrations, 9 Books; of the uſe of the Parts, 17 Books, and others. Very many men of this Age have diligently written of Anatomy,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:35070:118"/>amending and encreaſing the Doctrine of <hi>Galen.</hi> And amongſt them chiefly <hi>Veſalius, Fallopius, Columbus, Sylvius, Piccolhomineus, Laurentius, Platerus, Bauhinus, Caſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, Fabricius, Riolanus, Spigelius,</hi> and very many more, all whom to reckon up the Nature of this ſhort work wil not permit. We ſhal therefore in this place only with brevity name the Parts of the Body whereby al the actions thereof are performed; the Deſcription whereof may be ſeen in the Authors aforeſaid, which are in the hands of every one.</p>
                  <p>Now that the parts of our Bodies may be fit to perform their actions,
<note place="margin">the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the parts of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy wherein it conſiſts? the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar parts. the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of a Man, twofold.</note> they muſt needs be rightly diſpoſed. Now that diſpoſition conſiſts in three things: For ſince the parts of our Body are conſidered either as ſimilar only, or as diſſimilar and organical; in both of them Unity is required, and it is neceſſary that every part be one and entire. Moreover, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in the ſimilar parts there is required temper; in the organical compoſition and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, neceſſary for the actions of the Body; which is in divers parts different, according to the diverſity of the actions by them to be performed.</p>
                  <p>Now what in general a Temperament is, and what are its differences, hath been already declared in Book 3. chap. 4. But as to what concerns the Temperament of a Man, in him (as alſo in other Creatures, of whom he is as it were the Rule and meaſure) is found a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Temperament; the one of a Body, conſidered ſimply as a mixt Body; the other of a living Body. For when a man dies, that temper which he had as a living body does withal vaniſh; yet in the Carkaſs til it rot the parts do for a while retain the compoſition and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per which they have from the Elements.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the Temper of a mixt Body we ſpake before in the Book newly cited:
<note place="margin">Each part hath a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament.</note> but the Temper of a living Man, which reſults out of a certain harmony of al his parts, although it be hot and moiſt, and Life conſiſts in Heat and Moiſture; yet there is a great diverſity in the Parts. The Skin is the moſt temperate, eſpecially that in the Hand.</p>
                  <p>Among the Hot Parts the chief is the Heart:
<note place="margin">Hot parts:</note> after the Heart follows the Liver, the Spleen, the Fleſh of the Muſcles, the Kidneys, the Lungs, a Vein, an Artery, Fat and Suet.</p>
                  <p>Among Cold Parts,
<note place="margin">Cold parts</note> the firſt are the Bones, then the Griſles, the Ligaments, the Tendons, the Membranes, the Arteries, the Veins, the hard Nerves.</p>
                  <p>The Moiſt parts are,
<note place="margin">moiſt parts</note> Suet, Marrow, Brain, Spinal Marrow, Stones, Dugs, Lungs, Spleen, Kidneys, Fleſh of the Muſcles, Tongue, Heart, loft Nerves.</p>
                  <p>The dry are,
<note place="margin">Dry parts.</note> Bones, Griſtles, Ligaments, Tendons, Membranes, Arteries, Veins, hard Nerves.</p>
                  <p>Now this Temperament of a living Body is twofold,
<note place="margin">the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred Heat whereof it conſiſts.</note> or conſiſts in two things; Innate, and Influent Heat. Innate Heat is in that which is the inbred hot juyce natural: For by innate heat we underſtand not a bare quality, but a quality with its ſubject. This Innate Heat conſiſts of the inbred Spirit and original moiſture: and is nothing but the Primitive Moiſture filled in al parts with the implanted ſpirit and heat. For theſe three, Heat, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and Radical Moiſture, or Natural Balſam as ſome cal it, are ſo joyned together, as that they cannot be eaſily ſeparated. For this is that Body <hi>which is more Divine than the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo called, and is a ſubſtance bearing proportion to that of the Heavenly Bodies,</hi> as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> terms it in his 2. <hi>de generat. Animal. cap.</hi> 3. and by which the ſeeds of things are made fruitful, as the ſame <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> informs us.</p>
                  <p>This inbred heat is principally in the Spermatick Parts,
<note place="margin">the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the inbred heat:</note> which are called the firſt Parts. But it is chiefly found in the Heart, which therefore <hi>Galen</hi> cals the Hearth or Chimney of the inbred Heat. And this innate Heat is the chief inſtrument of the Soul, whereby it performs and perfects al actions. At the beginning of a Mans Life, and in his yonger yeers, it is much in quantity; and as he grows older, the Radical Moiſture is gradually conſumed and dried up, til at laſt being quite ſpent, the Heat is alſo extinguiſhed, and natural Death follows.</p>
                  <p>Now this inbred Heat is cheriſhed and fomented by the influent Heat,
<note place="margin">What the ſpirits in the body are?</note> through means of the Spirits, which are a moſt thin, hot, and movable body, bred of the moſt ſincere and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til part of the Blood; and being joyned with the inbred Heat they are the immediate and chief Inſtrument of the performance of al actions, and are a cauſe that the faculties of the Soul exerciſe their operations.</p>
                  <p>'Tis commonly taught by many,
<note place="margin">they do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh the faculties:</note> That theſe Spirits are the conveighers of the Faculties from the principal Parts to the reſt of the Body: but this is a falſe Opinion. For ſeeing the Faculties are inſeparable Properties of the Soul, and the Soul is in all the parts, it is every where furniſhed with its Faculties, not borrowing the ſame elſwhere.</p>
                  <p>Now touching the Number of theſe Spirits,
<note place="margin">the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Spirits:</note> ſeveral men are of ſeveral Opinions; and ſome
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:35070:118"/>make one, and others more. But we have reaſon to hold that there are divers Spirits. For although the more ſubtile part of the Blood be the firſt matter of them all; yet they receive a diverſe form in ſundry parts, and are fitted for divers uſes.</p>
                  <p>Now the Spirits are three, Natural, Vital, and Animal.</p>
                  <p>Touching the Natural many doubt.
<note place="margin">The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural:</note> We although we admit them into the number of Spirits, yet we acknowledg no ſmal difference betwixt it and the other Spirits, and that the name of Spirits does not ſo properly belong to them as to the others, nor that they have the ſame Office. Now it is generated in the Liver, and is contained in the Veins, and is the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and more ſpirituous part of the blood, bred of the vaporation of the blood, and affords matter to make the Vital Spirits of.</p>
                  <p>All grant a Vital Spirit,
<note place="margin">the Vital:</note> which is generated in the left Ventricle of the Heart of the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner part of the Blood, or Natural Spirit, flowing into the Heart, and firſt of al attenuated and elaborated in the right Ventricle; and of the Air drawn in by breathing, and by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latation of the Arteries. This Spirit is not only in the Heart the chief Inſtrument thereof, together with the inbred heat of the Heart; but alſo being ſpred abroad through the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries into the whol Body, it cheriſhes the inbred heat of al the parts, excites and encreaſes the ſame, and gives perfection as it were thereunto. And therefore ſome call it the influent Heat. Alſo this Spirit affords matter for the Animal Spirits.</p>
                  <p>Many indeed deny the Animal Spirit; yet we have reaſon to admit the ſame,
<note place="margin">the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal:</note> ſeeing it is wrought in a peculiar Member, viz. The Brain, nor can the Vital ſpirit perform thoſe uſes which the Animal does, and in a partful of Vital Spirit we ſee ſenſe and motion taken away for want of Animal Spirits, as in the Apoplexy, Palſey, and ſtupidity.</p>
                  <p>For this Spirit is the immediate Inſtrument of Senſe and Motion; and it is generated of the puteſt part of the Vital Spirit, carried by the Carotick and Cervical Arteries into the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis of the Brain, and thence into the Brain it ſelf, and mingled with Air drawn in by the fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of breath.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, The Organick parts have alſo their proper Conſtitution, viz.
<note place="margin">the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganick parts:</note> A due compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and connexion of the ſimilar parts into one form and ſhape, fit to exerciſe the action. Now there is required to the compoſition of Organick parts; firſt a juſt number of parts compounding; ſecondly, the greatneſs fit for the ſaid parts; thirdly, a decent conformation, which comprehends a ſigure fit to perform the action, cavities and paſſages, and that the ſurface be rough or ſmooth, as the Nature of the part requires; fourthly, ſcituation and connexion with other parts.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things whereof we have hitherto ſpoken being common to al parts, and neceſſary for al actions; we will now furthermore briefly recite how and by what parts the ſeveral actions are performed.</p>
                  <p>And ſeeing the Vegetative Faculty is the loweſt, we wil firſt treat thereof. Now it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains under it, Nutrition, Augmentation, and Generation.</p>
                  <p>And as to Nutrition and Augmentation in the firſt place, ſeeing in them Aliment is joyned to the Body from elſwhere (and the Aliment is in the firſt place unlike of ſubſtance) it muſt be elaborated by divers Concoctions, and be firſt made fit for the Body.</p>
                  <p>This Concoction is twofold; Private, which is performed in the ſeveral parts;
<note place="margin">A double Concoction in the body private &amp; publick. the firſt Concoction</note> and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, which is ordained for the uſe of the whol body, and is performed in the ſtomach chiefly, and in the ſpleen.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Concoction therefore is performed in the ſtomach; and for the ſame cauſe a double Appetite is given to the ſtomach; a Natural, whereby it deſires food for it ſelf alone; and an Animal Appetite, whereby it deſires food for the whol body.</p>
                  <p>For by Appetite and hunger a Man is pricked on and provoked to eat, and then the firſt preparation of the Meat is in the Mouth. For in the Mouth it is by the Teeth broken and ground; which for that cauſe (although they ſerve alſo to form the Speech) are given to a man commonly thirty two in number, in each Jaw ſixteen; of which ſome are called Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, others Dog-teeth, others Grinders. The Cutters or foremoſt are four in each Jaw; the Dog-teeth two; the Grinders ten. Moreover, by the Mouths heat, and the mixture of ſpittle, the meat is altered. The Meat being thus broken, ground, and prepared in the Mouth, is by the Tongues motion thruſt down the gaping Throat into the Stomach, which the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach by help of the oblique fibres does imbrace and retain til by the Concoctive Faculty thereof and its proper heat it be turned into a Maſs not unlike Barley Cream,
<note place="margin">the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Chyle.</note> which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Chylus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Chyle being wrought in the ſtomach is ſent out by the lower Orifice into the Guts,
<note place="margin">Diſcribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Chyle:</note> and is by them ſtil more elaborated. Now the Guts are of two ſorts, the Thick and the
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:35070:119"/>thin: The thin are three, <hi>Duodenum, Jejunum, Ileon;</hi> the thick alſo three, <hi>Coecum, Colon, Rectum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſeeing no Meat can be turned wholly into Nouriſhment,
<note place="margin">the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements of the firſt digeſtion.</note> but hath ſome parts in it unprofitable to nouriſh the Body: Nature in this, as all other Concoctions, ſeparates what is unprofitable, and breeds here a two-fold Excrement, the one thick, the other wateriſh.</p>
                  <p>The thicket Excrements are the Dung,
<note place="margin">the Dung</note> whoſe expulſion is through the Belly by ſtool: the Guts partly by their circular and tranſverſe fibres (with both which both their Coats are furniſhed) contracting themſelves above the ſame; partly by help of the Muſcles of the Belly, whereby the Belly is ſqueezed; and ſo the Excrements are forced downwards.</p>
                  <p>The thin and wateriſh Excrement is not preſently voided forth,
<note place="margin">The thin and watry excrement.</note> but remains mixed with the Chyle, that it being thereby made thin may the more eaſily paſs the narrow Veins of the Meſentery and Liver.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Concoction being finiſhed,
<note place="margin">The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, or blood-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</note> the Chyle is received out of the Meſaraick Veins, (whoſe Orifices reach into the Guts) is altered and changed a little, and is hence carried to the Roots of <hi>Vena Porta</hi> and to the Liver.</p>
                  <p>And that the blood may be bred more pure in the Liver, after the Blood hath received ſome rudiment in the Meſaraick Veins, that which is therein thick and dreggy is drawn by the Spleen through the Splenick Branch of the <hi>Porta,</hi> out of the Trunk of the Meſaraick Veins before it paſs to the Liver; where the Spleen alters it as much as it can and the matter will bear, and thereof breeds for it ſelf and the ignoble parts in the Belly a thick and dreggy blood. But that which is quite excrementitious, and cannot be turned into Aliment is evacuated, partly by the Hemorrhoidal Veins and <hi>Porta's</hi> Trunk, and partly by the Splenick Arteries.</p>
                  <p>The Chyle after it hath received ſome rudiments of Blood in the Meſaraick Veins, and is by help of the Spleen purged from the more dreggy parts thereof, it receives the form of perfect Blood in the Liver; and is thence diſtributed into al the parts of the Body to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh the ſame.</p>
                  <p>And ſince in every digeſtion Excrements are bred,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ſecond digeſtion.</hi> 1. <hi>Yellow Choler:</hi> 2 <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine</hi>
                     </note> there is alſo in Sanguification a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Excrement; yellow Choler, which is collected into the Gall-bladder, and is thence voided by the Guts, exciting them by its acrimony to purge themſelves: and the ſerous or wheyiſh excrement, which is drawn through the Emulgent Veins by the Kidneys, and is tranſmitted through the Ureters into the Bladder, and is by it voided forth and called Urine. For the Urine is nothing elſe but that watry moiſture in the Chyle that ſerved to make it paſs more eaſily, and the ſalt which was ſuperfluous in the meat and unſit to nouriſh the Body. Which appears not only by the taſt, but alſo becauſe ſtore of ſalt is drawn out of Urine, the watry moiſture being ſeparated.</p>
                  <p>The Blood which is diſtributed into the whol Body to nouriſh the ſame,
<note place="margin">The blood conſiſts of divers parts:</note> although it is contained under one form or ſhape, and is al uſeful to nouriſh the Body; yet its parts are not quite alike, but ſome temperate, which are peculiarly called blood; others hotter and drier, which are called Cholerick Blood; others colder and moiſter, which are called Fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Blood; others colder and drier, which are called Melancholy Blood; but vulgarly theſe parts are called, Choler, Flegm, and Melancholy.</p>
                  <p>And of theſe parts none is Excrementitious, but al are uſeful to nouriſh the Body; and in the Body of a ſound Man there is nothing Excrementitious, but only Alimentary blood is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in his Veins, and al the parts of our Bodies are nouriſhed only with blood.</p>
                  <p>This Blood in the ſeveral parts is elaborated according to the Nature of each part,
<note place="margin">the third concoction</note> and at length aſſimilated to the ſaid parts. And ſeeing in that elaboration the blood undergoes ſome mutations, Phyſitians do ſay, that in the third Concoction the four ſecondary humors are generated; whereof the one follows the other, and by theſe mutations the blood is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into the ſubſtance of the Body.
<note place="margin">the ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors.</note> The firſt is called the Nameleſs, the ſecond Dew, the third Glew, the fourth Cambium.</p>
                  <p>In this Concoction two Excrements are generated,
<note place="margin">the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements of the 3d Digeſtion.</note> the one more groſs, which is the filth that gathers about the Skin; the other more thin, which is diſcuſſed, partly by inviſible tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, and partly by ſweat. For the evacuation of which excrements the Skin was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with pores.</p>
                  <p>Moreover,
<note place="margin">the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</note> That a man might propagate and multiply himſelf, he received from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor the Faculty of Generation. Now Generation is cauſed by ſeed elaborated in the ſtones, unto which out of the reſt of the Body the beſt part of blood, ſpirit, and heat, is tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Veins, Arteries, and Nerves; and is by them reduced into a white froathy body,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:35070:119"/>ful of ſpirits, which is called ſeed and is a compendium as it were of all the Heat and Spirits in the Body.</p>
                  <p>This Seed is ſent forth both by the Man and Woman: for ſeeing Women are furniſhed with the ſame Inſtruments, both to make and vent Seed; and when they are provoked by Luſt they deſire Copulation, and void ſeed: we muſt needs grant that they contribute ſeed to Generation. And their ſeed goes to the making up of the Child: for the male and female are not two ſorts of Creatures: yet neither of their ſeeds is alone ſufficient for Generation, but this order is appointed by the Creator, that of both their ſeeds as two partial cauſes, one principle and one total cauſe ſhould ariſe, from which one motion (though in a certain order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſition) ſhould further the production of the Child.</p>
                  <p>The Seeds conceived in the Womb are by the inbred faculty thereof cheriſhed, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty lurking in the ſeed is ſtirred up, and the ſhape of the Organs begins to be expreſſed; and ſo conception is ſaid to be made, and then it is termed a Conception. Now the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes encompaſſing the Child are firſt formed, in which the nobler part of the ſeed and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is included; and they are two, one called <hi>Chorion</hi> compaſſes the whol Child, props up the umbilical veſſels, and by their their means it totally adheres to the Womb: the other immediately compaſſing the Child is called <hi>Amnios;</hi> which Coats ſeeing in the Birth they ſeem to be but one, are termed the After-birth, becauſe they come away after the Child.</p>
                  <p>Now the ſpermatick parts are firſt formed and that all at once. And afterwards every part is finiſhed, as the dignity and neceſſity thereof requires. At firſt there appear as it were three bubbles, and innumerable threds, being the underwoof of the ſolid parts. Theſe parts do afterwards receive encreaſe from the mothers blood. And hereupon the Creator hath ordained, that from the fourteenth yeer commonly of a Womans age, to the five and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth, there ſhould be ſome ſuperfluous blood as it were, bred in women, and afford matter for the Child in women that have conceived: or if a woman be not with Child that it ſhould be ſent unto the womb, and from thence purged away.</p>
                  <p>Since therefore the Child after it is once formed in the Seed is furniſhed from the mother with all things it ſtands in need of, there were navil veſſels made, viz. a Vein,
<note place="margin">The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil-veſſels The Vein. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries.</note> two Arteries and the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rachus,</hi> which about the navil grow together into one. The Vein is a branch of <hi>Vena Portae,</hi> to which it is contiguous, being the Nurſe (as it were) of the Infant: the two Arteries (branches of the <hi>Ramus Iliacus</hi>) deſcending do ſpring from the <hi>Aorta;</hi> whereby arterial blood and ſpirit are communicated to the Infant, and by which the Infant draws breath. The <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rachus</hi> is carried from the bottom of the Bladder to the Navil;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The</hi> Ura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus.</note> when the Child is born, there being no longer uſe of theſe Inſtruments for theſe intents, they grow to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and perform the office of the Ligaments as it were.</p>
                  <p>Now the whol time from the Conception to the Birth is divided by Phyſitians into two parts; the time of formation or ſhaping,
<note place="margin">The time of Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> from the Conception to the time the Child begins to ſtir; and the time of perfection, which is from the time it begins to ſtir, to the time it is born: yet others divide it into three parts, viz. into the time of Formation, which <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, de natura pueri,</hi> determines to be of Girls in forty daies, of Males in thirty:
<note place="margin">The time of Motion.</note> the time of motion which is commonly ſaid to be of Males in the third month, of Girls in the fourth: and thirdly, the time of birth.</p>
                  <p>Now as to the time of birth, that is various in mankind: yet experience teaches,
<note place="margin">The time of Birth.</note> that no Child is born alive before half a yeer be paſt. The Child born in the ſeventh month may live: but no Child born in the eighth month can live according to <hi>Hippocrates;</hi> yet ſome hold that the eighth months Child does ſomtimes live. But the moſt orderly and frequent time of childing is the ninth month, and moſt Children are brought forth from the 15. of the ninth month, to the 15. of the tenth.</p>
                  <p>And although Phyſitians have obſerved that ſome have been born in the eleventh month and after the eleventh month:
<note place="margin">How the months are reckoned.</note> yet ſuch births are to be reckoned amongſt rare acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</p>
                  <p>Now the months according to which the times of Child-birth are reckoned are the ſolar months, or months of the Sun; from which nevertheleſs the lunar Conjunctions (conſiſting of twenty nine daies and twelve minuts) do not much vary. Nor muſt this laborious frame of mans body be ried to ſuch ſmal obſervances of time.</p>
                  <p>After the Natural faculty comes the Vital, being diſtinct from the Natural and Animal,
<note place="margin">three fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in the Heart</note> both in actions and peculiar organs, and hath its ſeat in the Heart. Now under the term of vital faculty divers powers are comprehended; and there are in the Heart three faculties, the Wrathful, the Breeder of ſpirit and vital Heat, and Pulſing faculty which is ſubſervient hereunto.</p>
                  <pb n="406" facs="tcp:35070:120"/>
                  <p> From the wrathful faculty proceed al the paſſions of the mind,
<note place="margin">the wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful faculty</note> Anger, Manſuetude, Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Fear, Hope, Dejection, Joy, Sadneſs, and others of this kind which follow the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Now ſome of theſe are cauſed materially (that I may ſo ſpeak) or in way of an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cauſe, by expanſion of the Heat, Spirit and Blood, as Anger, Joy, and the like; ſome by the Concentration or gathering inward of the ſaid Blood and Spirits, as Fear, Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the like: and formally they are all no other than Appetites; and theſe motions do follow an appetite, either of proſecuting that which delights, or of avoiding that which is hurtful; the former of which cauſes an expanſion or ſpreading abroad of the Heat and Blood, and the latter cauſeth them to retire inwards. Now theſe motions cannot be made, ſave by agitation of the Heart and Arteries, and of fervent and ſpirituous Blood. Whence it is apparent why the wrathful faculty needs a very hot Bowel, and which is in continual motion.</p>
                  <p>Now the Heart is ſeated in the middle region of the Body, viz. in the Cheſt, that from it as a fountain the vital heat and ſpirit may readily be diffuſed into the whol Body. Now the Heart hath two Ventricles,
<note place="margin">the uſe of the Heart and its Ventricles.</note> the right and left: the right Ventricle out of the wide mouth of the <hi>Vena cava</hi> draws in Blood by its Diaſtole, which it perfectly concocts and attenuates: the thinner portion whereof is tranſmitted into the left Ventricle of the Heart, by thoſe holes in the partition wall betwixt the two Ventricles; which nevertheleſs ſome deny: but the remaining and greateſt part paſſes through the <hi>Vena arterioſa</hi> into the Lungs; ſome part wherof is ſpent in nouriſhing the Lungs, but for the greateſt part is carried through the <hi>arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria venoſa</hi> into the left Ventricle of the Heart.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe things are performed by a certain wonderful and perpetual motion of the Heart,
<note place="margin">the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Heart.</note> whereby in the Diaſtole its extream parts are contracted, and the point of the Heart is drawn to the Baſis, and ſo the Heart becomes more ſhort, but the ſides thereof are dilated: but in the Syſtole the Heart becomes longer, and narrower. And ſeeing for the breeding of ſpirits and Arterial blood there is need both of Air and Blood, and theſe two ſubſtances cannot be drawn with one motion: beſides the Ventricles which draw the Blood, on each ſide at the Baſis of the Heart there are two notable cavities, ending into the upper part of the Ventricles, which by a peculiar motion of their own do draw to themſelves Air to cheriſh the Spirits and fan the vital Heat, which are termed the Hearts Earlets. For although others ſay their uſe is to be as it were Store-houſes of the Blood and Air flowing in, and guard the <hi>Vena cava,</hi> and the <hi>Arteria venoſa:</hi> yet ſome conceive, that by a peculiar motion they draw in Air; and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> himſelf, <hi>Lib. de corde,</hi> holds that they cool the Heart like a pair of Bellows.
<note place="margin">the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardium.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that the Heart may not be hindred in its motion, it hath allotted unto it a large and membranous Manſion, which they cal <hi>Pericardium</hi> the Heart-bag, which hinders any thing from preſſing upon the Heart or troubling the ſame in its motion.</p>
                  <p>But ſeeing nothing could go into or come out of the Heart unleſs it had been furniſhed with certain conveighances:
<note place="margin">the four Veſſels of the Heart.</note> therefore in the Baſis of the Heart four remarkable Veſſels are ſeen, two in the right, and as many in the left Ventricle: In the right, the <hi>Vena cava,</hi> and the <hi>Vena arterioſa;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vena cava</note> in the left, the <hi>Arteria magna,</hi> and the <hi>Arteria venoſa.</hi> The <hi>Vena cava</hi> is at the right Ventricle of the Heart, and pours Blood into the Heart, for the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of arterial Blood and vital Spirit and the nouriſhment of the Lungs. Howbeit others think the Blood which is wrought in this Ventricle is alſo diſtributed through the whol Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
<note place="margin">Vena Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terioſa. Arteria venoſa Arteria magna:</note> Then there is the <hi>Vena arterialis,</hi> which carries blood out of the right Ventricle to the Lungs for to nouriſh them, as alſo to become the matter of arterial Blood and vital Spirit; the <hi>Arteria venoſa</hi> carries Air from without and prepared in the Lungs, and Blood brought out of the right Ventricle of the Heart by the <hi>Vena arterioſa,</hi> into the left Ventricle, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels ſmoaky exhalations, and diſtributes a portion of the vital Spirit into the Lungs. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is the <hi>Aorta</hi> or <hi>Arteria magna,</hi> which diſtributes the vital Spirit and Arterial Blood bred in the left Ventricle through the whol Body: And theſe are (as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaies) <hi>Pegai Phuſios Anthropou,</hi> the <hi>Fountains of the Nature of Man.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">the Valves</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſeeing theſe Veſſels have each of them two uſes (for examples ſake, the <hi>Arteria ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalis</hi> doth not only draw Air out of the Lungs into the left Ventricle of the Heart, but it communicates vital ſpirit and arterial blood to the Lungs, and expels ſmoaky vapors) leſt the ſubſtances entring the Heart ſhould fal back the ſame way they came in before they have gained their perfection, or that which is ſhed out of the Heart might return thither again, there are eleven Valves placed in the orifices of the Veſſels; three in the orifices of all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Veſſels, and only two in the <hi>Arteria venoſa:</hi> Of which Valves ſome are open outwards and ſhut inwards, namely thoſe that paſs the matter to the Heart; others are open within,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:35070:120"/>ſhut without, being ſuch as paſs matter from the Heart. In the orifice of the <hi>Vena cava</hi> are three Valves, open outwardly, ſhut in wardly; contrariwiſe, in the orifice of the <hi>Vena Arterioſa</hi> there are as many open within, ſhut without: in the orifice of the <hi>Vena arteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſa</hi> there are as many, open within ſhut without: in the orifice of the <hi>Arteria venoſa</hi> there are two, which are open without, ſhut within; in the orifice of the <hi>Arteria magna</hi> are three Valves, open within ſhut without.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe the Heart diſtributes Heat and Spirit through the Arteries into the whol Body, there are paſſages made to carry the ſame, viz. the Branches of the great Arterie,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>the Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of</hi> Arteria magna.</note> which themſelves alſo are dilated and contracted, and by the pores of the Skin draw in Air, expel ſmoaky vapors, and communicate to the whol body vital Spirit, Heat, and Arterial Blood; and this motion of the Heart and Arteries is termed the Pulſe.</p>
                  <p>Now the Pulſe conſiſts of two motions, Syſtole and Diaſtole.
<note place="margin">Of what motions the Pulſe doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt.</note> By the Diaſtole or dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation the Heart is filled, and draws Air and Blood out of the Lungs by the <hi>Arteria venoſa;</hi> and the Arteries by their orifices, which end in the Skin, do draw ſome of the ambient Air: but by the Syſtole or Compreſſion the Heart diſtributes vital Spirit and Heat through the whol body, by the <hi>Arteria magna,</hi> and expels fuliginous excrements to the Lungs, by the <hi>Arteria venalis:</hi> alſo the Arteries expel fuliginous excrements by their orifices, which action is termed <hi>adelos diapnoe,</hi> inſenſible Tranſpiration.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe the Air, which is drawn by the Heart, was to be altered before it came thither,
<note place="margin">the chief Organ of Reſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> therefore the Lungs were given, and Reſpiration ordained. The chief Organ of reſpiration is the Lungs. For although the Cheſt and other parts do alſo ſerve for reſpiration: yet that motion is primarily performed by the Lungs, which have a peculiar faculty to dilate and contract themſelves, as the Heart and Brain alſo have: which may eaſily be obſerved in the diſſection of Live-anatomies. Nor is reſpiration a voluntary motion,
<note place="margin">Reſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary motion:</note> ſo that the Lungs ſhould dilate themſelves upon the motion of the Cheſt, to avoid <hi>Vacuum;</hi> but the Lungs are moved by a proper power of their own, and the Lungs and Cheſt are moved to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, becauſe they conſpire both to one end. For the Lungs by an inbred faculty are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated: and that it might be done more conveniently, and that it might have room wherein to dilate it ſelf, when the Lungs move, the animal faculty at the ſame time moves the Cheſt. And indeed theſe two motions hold proportion one to another. Nor are the Lungs diſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded becauſe they are filled, as a Bladder that is blown up; becauſe Air is not from any place blown into the Lungs: but they are filled becauſe they are dilated, after the manner of a pair of Bellows.</p>
                  <p>Now reſpiration conſiſts of two Motions, Inſpiration and expiration.
<note place="margin">Reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made up of two motions:</note> By Inſpiration the Lungs and Cheſt being widened, Air is drawn in by the Mouth and Noſtrils for to cool the Heart and to make vital Spirit: and by Expiration, the Lungs and Cheſt being compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, fuliginous excrements are voided at the Mouth and Noſtrils. Hence, that much Air might be attracted and retained therein, the Lungs exceed all the Bowels in greatneſs, and have a rare and porous ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe the Air was to have an Ingreſs into the Lungs,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>the</hi> Aſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra Arteria:</note> therefore was the Weſand <hi>[Aſpera arteria]</hi> or Wind-pipe made; whoſe larger Trunk might receive Air, partly by the Mouth and partly by the Noſtrils; and other branches innumerable are diſtributed into all the parts of the Lungs, that they might be totally repleniſhed with Air; which Air the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels coming from the Heart to the Lungs, being large and great, do receive at their ends, and carry it into the Ventricles of the Heart.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe a man perpetually needs to draw in the Air, the Weſand is made of ſolid griſly rings, that it may be kept perpetually wide and gaping.</p>
                  <p>But leſt the Meat or Drink in paſſing over the Wind-pipe ſhould fall thereinto,
<note place="margin">the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glottis:</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a mans life might be endangered: on the top thereof a ſoft and ſharp-pointed <hi>Griſle</hi> is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſticking out, which they cal <hi>Epiglottis,</hi> which covers the paſſage of the Wind-pipe, while Meat or Drink ſlips over it.</p>
                  <p>Now the Cheſt,
<note place="margin">the Cheſt:</note> ſince it was to be partly a defence of the vital parts and partly the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of Reſpiration; it was to be neither quite fleſhy nor quite boney. Therefore the Cheſt doth conſiſt of twelve pair of Ribs,
<note place="margin">Its Ribs and Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles:</note> which that they might come and go to dilate and contract the Breaſt, ſixty five Muſcles were made, thirty two whereof diſtend, and as many contract the Cheſt.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe there are no Ribs in the lower part of the Breaſt;
<note place="margin">the Midrif</note> that there might be in that place alſo a part that might be diſtended and contracted, and might likewiſe ſeparate the vital Organs from the lower Belly, a certain partition wall is interpoſed of a muſculous or fleſhy ſubſtance, which is called the Midrif, which when the Air is breathed forth
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:35070:121"/>is raiſed up, but being looſened it is dilated, and depreſſed in Inſpiration or drawing in of the Air, or fetching wind. And becauſe through the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> neat the Back, the Gullet, the <hi>Arteria magna,</hi> and <hi>Vena Cava</hi> do paſs, leſt by the perpetual motion of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> theſe parts ſhould be ſtraitened and agitated, the middle of the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragma</hi> is Membranous, and contains no fleſhy ſubſtance, that though the muſculous part of the Diaphragme or Midrif is moved, yet that part may not be contracted.</p>
                  <p>Having done with the Vital Function, it follows in the next place, that we enquire by what means and with what Inſtruments the operations of the ſenſitive faculty are perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. And in the firſt place, that the Inſtrument of ſeeling which is the moſt common ſenſe is a Membrane,
<note place="margin">The Skin is not the adequate inſtrument of feeling.</note> hath been ſaid already in Book 7. Chap. 6. But as to the Skin, 'tis true indeed that it is folded about the whol Body, not only that it may cloath the whol Body, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the other parts from external injuries, and that it may faſten and bind al the parts toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but alſo that it may be the Inſtrument of feeling, and may perceive external objects and injuries every way incident. And <hi>Galen</hi> rightly ſaid 1. <hi>de temper. cap.</hi> 9. that the Skin, eſpecially that in the hand, is the Rule of al ſenſible objects, and an Inſtrument of feeling properly fitted for ſo prudent a Creature as Man is.

                  <p>The To gue is the Inſtrument of Taſting,

                  <p>The adequate Organ of the Hearing is indeed the whol Ear.
<note place="margin">The Organ of Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, its parts and uſe. the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted air</note> But what is the chief part in the Ear that contributes to Hearing, Authors are at great variance, while ſome ſay the implanted Air, others a certain Nerve is the immediate Inſtrument of Hearing. But if we ſhal diligently weigh the matter, theſe Opinions may be ſome waies reconciled, as was ſaid <hi>Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. For it is altogether probable that a certain implanted Air or aery ſubſtance is required to cauſe the Senſe of Hearing. For as to receive the viſible Species the Organ of Sight is ſhining and lightſom; ſo alſo to receive ſounds, 'tis credible that the Organ of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring is Aerial. But ſeeing the Organ of a Senſe ought to be a part ſimilar and animated, ſimple Air cannot be the Organ of Hearing; but it muſt be a certain Aery ſubſtance, bred of the moſt pure and Aery part of the Seed and maternal blood, ſuch as may have affinity with the external Air, and may receive the ſounds brought in. But whether this ingrafted Air be in the expanded Nerve, or in ſome Cavity, can hardly be determined; ſince Anatomy in this point affords little help, and after death we find nothing obvious to the ſight. Whence alſo it is that that ſame other Queſtion can hardly be reſolved; Whether this Air be only an internal Medium, to receive and tranſmit ſounds to the true Organ of Hearing, which is the widened end of the Auditory Nerve? or, Whether (which as the Opinion of <hi>Capivaccius</hi>) this Air it ſelf ſeated in the expanded Nerve be the Organ of Hearing?</p>
                  <p>All the other parts of the Ear have each their uſe in Hearing.
<note place="margin">the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Ear</note> The external Ears by their ſticking out do receive the ſound, and cauſe it to rebound into the Auditory paſſage. Hence thoſe that are crop-eared, or have their Earlaps cut off, they do not hear exactly, but perceive ſounds like fluctuating Water.</p>
                  <p>From the out ward Ear or Earlap,

                  <p>Now this Membrane is exceeding dry that it may rightly receive ſounds: for Inſtruments of Muſick teach us, that the drieſt things are moſt apt to ſound.</p>

                  <p>Somwhat we have ſpoken concerning the ſight,
<note place="margin">the parts of the Eye, and their uſes.</note> Book 7. chap. 2. Its Inſtrument is the Eye; which hath many parts, each of which hath its peculiar uſe. The firſt is the <hi>Cornea Tunica,</hi> or Horny Coat of the Eye, which is tranſparent and void of al color, that the viſible
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:35070:121"/>ſpecies may paſs there-through into the Eye, and that pure and uninfected with any ſtrange color. It is thicket than the Air, that the ſpecies coming out of the Air (a thinner Mediu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Next the watry humor comes the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea Tunica</hi> or Grape-skin Coat,
<note place="margin">the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea tunica.</note> which is furniſhed with ſuch a blackneſs as is not to be ſeen in al the body beſides, to the end the ſpecies might become more clear, and appear better in the Criſtalline humor. For weak Lights do more appear in an obſcure datkiſh place than in a lightſom. Alſo this Coat ſeems to have another End, <hi>viz.</hi> That over much light which might enter in at the Apple of the Eye, and offend the Eye and the ſight, might by this black Coat be intercepted.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea</hi> or the Grape-skin Coat,
<note place="margin">the Apple of the Eye.</note> there is an hole which is called the Apple of the Eye, being the door as it were by which the viſible ſpecies do enter into the Eye. This hole (that the ſight may be more perfect and diſtinct) is much leſs than the compaſs of the <hi>Cornea:</hi> Yet in ſome it is larger, in others narrower; and thoſe that have it narrower do ſee more ſharply, thoſe that have it broad are weak-ſighted.</p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>Pupilla</hi> or Apple of the Eye is ſtraitened and widened,
<note place="margin">Why it wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens and darrows.</note> and in a light place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears narrower, in an obſcure place wider: For ſeeing two much light hurts the ſight, and a weak light is not ſufficient for ſight, and in an obſcu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e place the viſible object is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently diſcerned; this Window (as it were) is made in the entrance of the Eye, which may be widened and narrowed, and by widening let in ſo much light in an obſcure place as may be ſufficient for ſight; and by narrowing exclude too much Light which may offend the ſight.</p>
                  <p>And in regard of this Conſtitution of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea Tunica,</hi> there are three natural manners of ſight; one is moſt perfect, being conſtituted in an indiviſible point, and whereby we diſcern diſtinctly the ſmalleſt things: The other is perſect, when we ſee viſible objects at a juſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and can diſtinguiſh them though we do not diſcern the ſmalleſt part of every of them: The third is imperfect and confuſed, whereby beſides things juſt againſt us (which we ſee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly) we do alſo confuſedly diſcern things on either ſide of us; and for this ſights ſake the Horny Coat is broader than the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea</hi> or Grape-skin Coat, to the intent that at one view we may behold divers things, though not al diſtinctly.</p>
                  <p>Now this is the Cauſe of this Difference. Seeing the comprehenſion of a viſible thing is made by a Pyramid; and the certification by its <hi>Axis;</hi> and only that perpendicular Line which is called the <hi>Axis,</hi> and which is not refracted, does effectually, plainly, and diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſent the thing; but other Raies, by how much they are neerer to, or further from it, by ſo much the ſtronger or weaker they are in repreſenting: hence doubtleſs it comes to paſs that when the Apple of the Eye is narrower, only the perpendicular in the Pyramid of ſight does enter, or with it the Raies which are neareſt the <hi>Axis;</hi> when the Apple is wider, more Raies (oblique and refracted) do enter with the perpendicular.</p>
                  <p>Next the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea</hi> is the Criſtalline Humor,

                        </gap> ument of ſight?</note> For ſome (and the greateſt part) do hold that this Humor is the chief Inſtrument of ſight, and that therein only the ſpecies are received and diſcerned: Others (ſeeing that the Glaſſie Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor is alſo tranſparent, and much greater than the Criſtalline, and placed behind the ſame) are of Opinion that the ſight is not terminated in the Criſtalline, but that the viſible ſpecies paſſing through the Criſtalline are received in the Glaſſie Humor, and being refracted are gathered into one point, and received by the Optick Nerve: which Opinion ſeems to be very probable. For ſeeing refraction is exceeding neceſſary to ſight; al this furniture of the Eye, and the variety of tranſparent parts therein was contrived, that divers refractions might be made. And hence alſo the Criſtalline Humor is more compact than the Watry, that a new refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction might be made therein.</p>
                  <p>This Criſtalline Humor is ſeated in the fore part of the Glaſſie Humor,
<note place="margin">the Gſaſſie Humor.</note> ſo called becauſe it reſembles melted Glaſs. Its ſubſtance is ſofter than the Criſtalline, and leſs fluid than the Watro. The Quantity hereof is ſo great, that it takes up almoſt three quarters of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities of the Eyes. <hi>Galen</hi> and many others have hitherto thought, that this Humor was made to nouriſh the Criſtalline; but falſly: For what need was there of ſo great a quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Glaſlie humor, if it were only to nouriſh the Criſtalline? alſo the Criſtalline Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:35070:122"/>might be nouriſhed by a much readier way; nor needed ſo laborious a contrivance of the Glaſſie Humor, if it were made only for nouriſhment: nor is there any example in the whol Body of one part nouriſhing another, but they al draw their nouriſhment from the Veins, whether they be white or red. The Opinion therefore of others ſeems to be truer, who hold, That the Vitreous or Glaſſie Humor hath received this ſhape, place, and quantity, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the viſible Images or Raies being refracted out of the Criſtalline into the Glaſſie, which is leſs compact than the Criſtalline, might meet together in one point, and after that manner be offered to the ſight.</p>
                  <p>The Optick Nerves ariſe from the hinder part of the Brain,
<note place="margin">the Optick Nerves.</note> and going forward a long way, they are at laſt inſerted into the Eyes. Theſe Nerves after they are gone a little from their original are joyned together, not by ſticking one to another, or croſſing one another, but by an abſolute Union; but ſoon after they are again ſeparated, and being divided, the right goes to the right Eye, the left to the left. And ſome wil have the reaſon to be, leſt viſible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſhould appear double becauſe there are two eyes. But ſeeing theſe Nerves are not joyned in their beginning, but on their way, it is more probable that the reaſon thereof is, That the Optick Spirit (when need is) might be ſent totally wel near into one Eye, that ſo the ſight may be ſtronger in one Eye; which comes to paſs when we ſhut one eye, that we may ſee a thing more accurately with the other.</p>
                  <p>But ſince Sight is made right forward, if the Eyes were immovable, we ſhould be able to ſee only ſuch things as are juſt againſt us. To the end therefore the Eye might ſee more things and that diſtinctly, it is furniſhed with Muſcles whereby it may be moved. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Eye was not capable of al the differences of motions; ſuch as they want are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the motion of the Head. But that one thing ſeen by the two Eyes may not appear double, both the Eyes are alwaies naturally moved to the ſame differences of poſition: and therefore the Nerves by which they are moved ariſe from the fore part of the Spinal Marrow, joyned together in one point as it were, that ſo they may agree together in every motion.</p>
                  <p>There are alſo beſides,
<note place="margin">the Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids:</note> certain outward parts ordained to aſſiſt the Sight, viz. Two Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids, the upper and the lower: of which the upper is only movable; the uſe of which is to defend the Eyes from external injuries, as Air, Wind, Smoak, Duſt. Howbeit, ſome add alſo another uſe, viz. To purifie the Eyes: For ſince ſight requires a pure tranſparent bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the Horny Coat is eaſily dimmed by reaſon of the moiſture which ſweats out of the Kernel, as alſo by the external Air: in the opening of the Eye they conceive the Eyelid wipes al foulneſs from the <hi>Cornea Tunica.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the external Senſes come the internal, of which we have ſpoken, Book 7. chap. 7. The immediate Inſtrument by which, and in which they are exerciſed, is the Brain, which for the performance of theſe Functions is furniſhed with a peculiar ſubſtance, the like whereof is not to be found in the whol Body again.</p>
                  <p>Now the Brain of a Man,
<note place="margin">the Brain:</note> the ſubſtance whereof is ſoft and white, in reſpect of the bulk of his body is exceeding great; becauſe Man-kind is more exerciſed in Animal actions than other living Creatures, and therefore needs great plenty of ſpirits, which cannot be bred but of much matter, and in a large place.</p>
                  <p>Now the Brain is made to perform the actions of the inner Senſes,
<note place="margin">Its uſe.</note> and of the Rational Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and to generate Animal Spirits, which are the immediate Inſtrument of theſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And the Brain is moved by a Natural and peculiar motion for the better generation of Animal Spirits, and like the Heart in its Diaſtole it draws matter for the generation of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and in its Syſtole it pours out the Spirits into the Organs of the Senſes.</p>
                  <p>Now the Brain is divided into three parts.
<note place="margin">Its parts.</note> And the firſt is divided by the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> into the foremoſt and hindermoſt part: The foremoſt, in which the Spirits are chiefly generated, is called by the name of the whol <hi>Cerebrum</hi> or the Brain: the latter <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> the Brainlet or petty Brain. Moreover the Brain is again divided by the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> into two equal parts, the Right and the Left. The Brain hath alſo its Ventricles and other parts, which are all moſt diligently deſcribed by Anatomiſts, nor can they be here briefly recited, nor wel underſtood without ocular inſpection and figures.</p>
                  <p>But let us here firſt enquire in what part of the Brain the Animal actions are performed.
<note place="margin">In what part of the Brain the Animal functions are exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed.</note> The vulgar Opinion is, That they are performed in the Ventricles: in which alſo they hold the Animal Spirits are generated of the Air drawn in and ſetching breath, and carried into the Brain by the Organ of Smelling, and of vital Spirit ſent up from the Heart by the Carotick Arteries; and ſo they commonly hold the Ventricles of the Brain to be the Store houſes as it were of the Spirits Animal. But late Anatomiſts having diligently weighed the Conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:35070:122"/>of the Brain, have left the ſaid Opinion. For ſeeing nothing reaches into the Ventricles of the Brain, beſides the Kernels, and that they have no paſſage ſave at the Tunnel and the kernel thereof (which by the conſent of al receives flegm out of the Brain) it eaſily appears from hence, that thoſe two remarkable Cavities (which are called Ventricles) were made to receive the excrements of the Brain: and that therefore they cannot alſo be the Shop and place of Animal Spirits. And therefore more likely it is, That the Animal Spirits are bread in the ſubſtance of the Brain it ſelf, and that therein they are contained and perform their Functions.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, it is alſo controverted;
<note place="margin">Whether the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have different places in the Brain:</note> Whether al the Functions which belong to the Brain are performed in one part thereof? or whether they are exerciſed diſtinctly in diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>inct pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? Some wil indeed have it, That the Faculties have ſeveral places, and they quarter the Fancy in the fore part of the Brain, Reaſon in the middle, Memory behind. And this makes them think ſo, becauſe one action being hurt, the reſt do remain ſound. Others quarter al theſe actions together, ſeeing they are exerciſed about the ſame objects: Who indeed deny not that one action may be hurt, and the reſt unhurt; but they ſay, this does not therefore happen becauſe they are in ſeveral places, but becauſe each action requires a peculiar diſpoſition in the Organ; whence it may happen, that one preternatural Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may hurt one action more than another; as for examples ſake, moiſture is more hurtful to the Memory than to the Fancy.

                  </p>
                  <p>Now although it is hard to determine any thing in this Caſe, and we muſt needs confeſs as in moſt other things, ſo in this, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> hath it, <hi>Exercitat.</hi> 307. <hi>Sect.</hi> 21. We like the Wolf deluded by the Stork do lick the Glaſs, but cannot touch the Gruel: yet it ſeems moſt probable that the common ſenſe is placed in the fore part of the Brain, ſeeing there al the external ſenſes concur, whoſe Centre (as it were) the common ſenſe is. But the other actions ſeem not to differ in their ſears, ſeeing they are converſant about the ſame objects.</p>
                  <p>There remains the moſt noble and proper action of a Man, Ratiocination, or Intellection, which is performed (doubtleſs) without the help of any Corporeal Organs. For the Mind does not underſtand by the Body or any part thereof, as the Medium wherewith. The Mind of Man indeed ſtands in need of a Phantaſm (becauſe the Soul while it is in the Body never underſtands without a Phantaſm) but uſes the ſame, not as an Organ, but as an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: For if the Intellect were tied to any Organ, by help whereof it acted, it could not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand al things: but according to the determinate diſpoſition thereof it ſhould act and only underſtand ſome things: as the Sight by the Eye perceives only colored things, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe.</p>
                  <p>And although after this manner we cannot aſſign any place to the Intellect:
<note place="margin">the ſeat of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> yet by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and conſequentially a certain ſeat is aſcribed thereto, viz. That wherein the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made. Imagination and Ratiocination are joyned together in one Seat, and Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is ſaid to be performed in the Brain, rather than in the Foot or Liver; becauſe in the Brain Phantaſms are offered thereunto, which it contemplates, but not in the Foot or Liver.</p>
                  <p>After the knowing Faculty of the Soul, there remains yet Appetite and local motion,
<note place="margin">the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of Animal Motion.</note> of which we ſpake in Book 7. chap. 8. where alſo it is ſaid, That a Muſcle is the Inſtrument of voluntary motion. And ſeeing there are four motions of Muſcles, ſo that they are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contracted, or extended, or transferred, or remain bent, as <hi>Galen</hi> teaches in <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de motu muſcul. cap.</hi> 8. Yet Contraction, whereby a Muſcle is drawn towards its head and proper Original, is the proper action thereof, by which the parts are turned any way as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion requires. Now there is a great number of Muſcles, by reaſon of the variety of the parts to be moved, and their ſundry motions; and ſome move the Thighs, others the Arms and Hands, others the Back, Breaſt, Head, Jaws, and other Parts.</p>
                  <p>Motion flows from the ſame Principle that Senſe does, viz. From the Brain; howbeit,
<note place="margin">Its Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</note> from the hinder part thereof peculiarly termed the Brainlet or <hi>Cerebellum;</hi> and the Nerves ariſing therefrom are more ſolid, and are diffuſed through the ſubſtance of the Muſcles.</p>
                  <p>And that the Body might be transferred from place to place,
<note place="margin">the Legs.</note> a Man hath Legs given him which are made of moſt ſtrong Bones, to ſupport the whol Body, and carry it from place to place; which that they might not be too heavy, are made hollow within.</p>
                  <p>And that a Man might ſtand firm and upright, and not totter as he goes,
<note place="margin">the Feet.</note> he hath Feet joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to his Legs, which are hollow in the middle, ſo that a Man ſtaies himſelf upon four props as it were: For when a Man moves forward, he ſets the former part of his Feet more firmly to the ground, and bears moſt upon them.</p>
                  <p>And that the Feet may be variouſly moved, divers articulations are made.
<note place="margin">their joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</note> For we go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to low places by bending our Knee; after lying or ſitting we raiſe our ſelves up: which could
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:35070:123"/>not be if our Leg and Thigh were not joynted. So we ſet our Foot more forward or back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as the ground is up-hill or down-hill. Alſo the hollow part of the Foot when we go upon pointed things, or uneven bodies, laies hold on them as it were an hand; and after the ſame manner alſo we go up a ladder. And therefore the Foot (as a Hand) is divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſive Toes, which when we go do faſten upon the ground like hooks; and are alſo the cauſe that we can go upon rough and uneven places as wel as thoſe that are plain and ſmooth. Now in the Toes of the Feet, the great Toe is not ſet againſt the other four as in the Hand, but they are al placed on a tow after the ſame manner. For the Hand being the Organ of taking hold, and the Foot of walking; as in laying hold a great variety of motion, ſo in walking the firmneſs and ſecurity of ſupport is requiſite. Moreover, that the Feet might accommodate themſelves to the variety of the ground whereon a Man goes; beſides Toes they are compounded of divers Bones, in reſpect of which they are ſomtimes bended, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times extended.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe Man only of al living Creatures is endued with Reaſon,
<note place="margin">the Hand.</note> he alſo alone hath an Inſtrument of laying hold or taking up, which are the Hands, the Inſtruments of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by which only he can ſupply himſelf with whatever other Creatures naturally have more than he, as to defend or cloath themſelves. Now two Hands are made, that if one wil not ſerve to hold a thing, both may. Again, they are variouſly diſtinguiſhed, that we may take up great things and little things, and bodies of what figure ſoever. Likewiſe againſt the four Fingers the Thumb is placed oppoſite; becauſe whatever we handle, either we encloſe it circularly with out hand, or faſten our Fingers upon it on the oppoſite ſides.</p>
                  <p>Moreover,
<note place="margin">Speech &amp; the uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof.</note> from the Motion of the Will Speech hath its original, wherewith we may conclude this our Epitomy: which as it is proper to man alone; ſo is it moſt profitable, and moſt highly neceſſary to preſerve the Societies of Man-kind: For Speech was given us that we might demand of others ſuch things as we wanted; and ſignifie what we had that we were willing to impart. And as <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaies, in <hi>Exercitat.</hi> 256 from <hi>Ariſtotle: Reaſon is the Hand of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding; and Speech, of Reaſon; and the Hand, of Speech. For the Hands perform what they are commanded; the Commands obey Reaſon: Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is the force of the Intellect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Inſtruments of the Voyce and Speech,
<note place="margin">
                        <p>the remate Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the voyce</p>
                        <p>the near or immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Inſiru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</p>
                     </note> are ſome remote and common, others near and proper. The former are the Inſtruments of Reſpiration, the Lungs and the Cheſt, and thoſe parts pertaining to theſe, the Midrif and the Intercoſtal Muſcles; which do not frame the voyce, but afford Spirit and Air which are neceſſary to the formation thereof. Now the near are the Wezand, the Larynx, the Muſcles which open and ſhut the Larynx, the recurrent Nerves, the <hi>Epiglottis</hi> and the Tongue. To which ſome others are ſubſervient, as the Palat and the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vula.</hi> Amongſt the moſt immediate are the Larynx, and eſpecially the <hi>Epiglottis,</hi> which is like the tongue of a pipe: For a pipe without a tongue is uſeleſs, nor can the voyce be framed unleſs the paſſage of the ſpirit or air be made narrow.</p>
                  <p>For Air and Spirit are required as matter to frame the Voyce: Inſtruments are neceſſary to drive it forth, which are the Lungs and Cheſt: there is need of an Inſtrument wherein it may be ſmitten, and wherein being ſmitten the Air may ſound; which is the <hi>Larynx,</hi> whoſe orifice being ſtraitened, and the Air ſmitten, the Voyce is cauſed. And becauſe the Caſe ſo required that a man was not alwaies to ſpeak, but when he lifted, the <hi>Larynx</hi> hath many Muſcles, by which the chink of the <hi>Larynx</hi> may be widened and ſtraitened as we pleaſe, and ſo ſundry Voyces framed.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe the Voyce of Man was to be articulate, to ſignifie the conceptions of his Mind, therefore his Tongue was framed with Muſcles to move the ſame, wherewith being moved it variouſly oppoſes it ſelf to the voyce iſſuing out of the <hi>Larynx,</hi> and ſo frames an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate ſpeech: to the formation whereof the Lips do alſo ſerve, which do themſelves alſo oppoſe the voyce, and with their motion precede, accompany, or come after the motion of the Tongue, as the Nature of the Articulated Speech requires.</p>

                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath been both by me and others elſwhere at large declared, That there are two things which chiefly draw the minds of men from Truth, and hinder the growth of all Diſciplines;</hi> viz. <hi>A Servile kind of Credulity, and a raſh deſire of Innovation. How much hurt both of theſe have done to other Diſciplines, let thoſe ſpeak that are skilled in them. That I may ſpeak of Natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy and Phyſick which belong to my Profeſſion; it cannot be demed but that much hurt hath been done to both theſe, especially to Natural Philoſophy, whiles ſome Men little regarding Reaſon and Experience, have ſolely adhered to the Authority of other Men; others out of a deſire of novelty have endeavored wholly to overthrow the foundations of ancient Diſcipline. From both theſe courſes I freely profeſs my ſelf to have been alwaies averſe: For neither would I be of the number of thoſe raſh Innovators, whether Paracelſians or Chymiſts, or how ever otherwiſe called, who endeavor wholly to baniſh from the Schools the ancient Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, which is come to us chiefly from the Writings of</hi> Ariſtotle: <hi>nor yet would I be recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned amongſt them who are not aſhamed in this Age of ours publickly to profeſs, that they had rather err with</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>and</hi> Galen, <hi>than ſpeak the Truth with any later Author. The Innowators aforeſaid I paſs over at preſent. Touching theſe latter, I conceive</hi> Julius Caeſar Scaliger <hi>hath well written in</hi> Exercit. 306. That thoſe Wits are moſt unhappy which ſtifly maintain, That our Anceſtors knew al things. <hi>I do not verily envy</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>thoſe praiſes wherewith the ſame</hi> Scaliger <hi>every where adorns him. Let us grant that</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>is a man that hath deſerved more than all mortal men beſides, of all the parts of Humane Knowledg; that he is the Father and Captain of our Wiſdom; that he is the chief Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Learning, the Emperor of Philoſophers; that he is the Eagle of the Philoſophical Kingdom of Wiſdom, and Literary praiſe; that he is the</hi> Hercules, <hi>the Prince, the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal of Truth; that he is the god of Philoſophers; and in a word, greater than all praiſe, and above all Calumny: yet neither he nor any mortal Man can be made the Rule of Truth. Let it be counted a comely and a decent thing to cite the Teſtimonies of</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>as of a prime Philoſopher for his Opinion, and to produce as many of them as may be: but if weighty reaſons be not added, a mind defirous of the Truth will not be contented with theſe alone. Their Courſe therefore is by no means approvable, who taking no care for reaſons, contend only with Authorities. Yet this is a fault common enough. For if we look into the Writings of ſome Men we ſee nothing brought to prove their Matter, but the Authorities of</hi> Hippocrates, Ariſtotle, <hi>and</hi> Galen, <hi>and oftentimes many interpretations are alleadged touching the ſence of ſome one place, and all thoſe rejected, and at laſt another ſubſtituted, perhaps no better than the former, and ſo in diſputing thereabouts</hi> pro <hi>and</hi> con, <hi>ſo many Pages are taken up, that he muſt have abundance of leiſure that would read them all. And which is a ridiculous thing, the contention is not ſo much about the mind of the
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:35070:124"/>Author ſpeaking in his own Language, as the Interpretation of a barbarous and faulty tranſlation, which is obtruded for the mind of the Author; and ſo they play at Blind-mans Buff.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So much reverence ought indeed to be afforded</hi> Ariſtotle, <hi>that if any thing ſeems by him inconveniently expreſſed, it be ſoftened with a fit Interpretation. But if the matter be plain, (only ſome opinion of</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>doth not agree with the truth</hi>) <hi>'tis vain to labor to fix another ſence upon</hi> Ariſtotle. <hi>And that which is the top of all the miſchief, you ſhal find ſuch opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons given out every where for Ariſtotelean, which are no where extant in</hi> Ariſtotle, <hi>being the Inventions of School-men, whoſe cuſtom hath been to delight themſelves in diſputing al things</hi> pro <hi>and</hi> con.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which thing, as I ſaid, doth not a little hinder the progreſs of al diſciplne; whiles both our time is laviſhly waſted, and conſumed without proſit, of which we ought to be ſparing Stewards, ſince life is ſhort and Art is long; and we wander from the way of ſinding the truth. For there are two Principles only of ſinding out all truth, and Touch-ſtones of all opinions, Reaſon and Experience. He that follows theſe two doth not caſily err: but they who neglecting theſe do fly to that external Argument, viz. Authority, and like Slaves ſwear to the ſayings of one man, and of a Man make a kind of God, who cannot be deceived; they eaſily ſlip into ſundry Errors. Hence (to ſpeak nothing of Phyſick or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of Pinloſophy, but to keep me to natural Philoſophy, for whoſe ſake I ſpeak all this) amongſt the Expounders of</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>(whom all the Philoſophers wel nigh of all Nations for ſome ages laſt paſt have believed ſo to have perfected this part of Philoſophy, that there needs no further labor but to underſtand his writings) ſo many diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſo many indiſſoluble objections, to and fro, have ariſen, which in ſo many ages of years have not been ended, but that dayly they have divided into many ſects, while diſputing upon the ſuppoſitions of ſeveral ſects, one man will maintain one way, another man another; this man being for</hi> Averrhoes, <hi>a ſecond for</hi> Thomas Aquinas, <hi>a third for</hi> Scotus, <hi>a fourth for another; that you cannot tel whom to give credit to. And that is true of</hi> Euripides, One man ſees not all things. <hi>And no man hath ever been found, that hath not erred and miſtaken, or as</hi> Galen <hi>hath it:</hi> It is hard for him that is a Man not to offend in many things, viz. being quite ignorant of ſome, judging amiſs of others, and negligently ſetting down other things in writing. <hi>And therefore when free and excellent wits, and prudent Men had obſerved, that the Authorities of the Ancients had bitherto more bindered than furthered the Advancement of Learning; and ſaw that thereby a Bridle was caſt upon the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding of Man, and upon many excellent wits; they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to caſt off this yoke of Bondage, and to ſeek the knowledg of things from the things themſelves.</hi>

                  <hi>Yet they themſelves alſo who have not followed only Authorities but weighed the Things themſelves have not al happily touched the white of Truth. For ſeeing, as hath been ſaid, Reaſon and Experience is the Rule of Truth in matters of Nature: Experience muſt of neceſſity precede, and when a thing is ſo found out, Reaſon is to prove the ſame: wherin ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs many offend; for ſeeing many neglect Experience, and rely only upon Reaſons, &amp; give too much credit to their ſpeculations, they muſt of neceſſity be very often deceived. Of which thing we have every where remarkable Documents; ſome of old truſting to certain ſleight reaſons denied there were Antipodes; amongſt whom was</hi> Lactantius, <hi>who largely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighs againſt thoſe Philoſophers who held there were Antipodes, in</hi> Divin. Inſtitur. Lab. 3. cap. 24 <hi>&amp; counts thoſe men fools who beleeved there were ſuch Antipodes who hung by their Legs, and whoſe Feet were higher than their Heads: and cals it folly &amp; vanity to hold there were Men in the world who went with their Feet juſt againſt ours. And</hi> Auguſtine de Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Dei Lib. 16. Cap. 9. <hi>counts it fabulous to beleeve, that there were men on the other ſide of the Earth, who went with their Feet againſt ours.

For Pope</hi> Zachary <hi>writ to</hi> Boniface, <hi>to drive</hi> Vigilius <hi>from the Church as an Heretick, and to deprive him of his Prieſthoed, unleſs he would abandon his perverſe Doctrine. So, in the foregoing ages ſome endeavored by ſleight reaſons to perſwade that the torrid Zone was not inhabited; both which Experience and late Navigations have taught to be falſe.

                  </gap>barella <hi>a moſt learned Interpreter of</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>acknowledged this Error, who in</hi> Lib. 2. de propoſit. neceſſ. cap. 17. <hi>thus writes:</hi>
                  <pb n="415" facs="tcp:35070:124"/>All theſe things are ſo true, that all men ought to know them by Inſpectionof the things themſelves, if in theſe daies we had Philoſophers, who Philoſophiſed by ſearching dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently into the Natures of things; and did not onlyaddict themſelves to the words of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi> and thoſe many times miſunderſtood, to which they are wont to accommodate the things themſelves; ſeeking nothing elſe but what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, and taking their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the knowledg and proof of all things, only from his words. <hi>The Premiſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, not out of any deſire to inveigh againſt and carp at</hi> Artiſtotle <hi>(whom I reverence as much as any man can) or any other Perſons, but only out of deſire to find out the Truth, I began more diligently to examin certain things referring to ſome Controverted Heads of natural Philoſophy. For although ſomwhat above thirty yeers ago, I collected a certain Epitomy of natural Philoſophy, and afterwards publiſhed the ſame: yet the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of other Authors and eſpecially of Phyſitians (who have handled natural Philoſophy more diligently than other men, and are therefore called Phyſitians, that is to ſay, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſts) the Conſideration of natural things, and exerciſe of chymical Operations, and in a word, Experience hath taught me many things; ſo that to uſe the words of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick Poet,</hi> Such things as I thought I knew, I am ignorant of, and ſuch things as I had an high conceit of, Experience teaches me to reject. <hi>I conceive indeed, that the moſt things If wrote in that ſmal Epitomy are agreeable to Nature; but yet I ſuppoſe there are ſome things which may be more rightly, or cleerly expreſſed. Whereof, I think I am not to be blamed for admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing my Reader; ſince very many moſt learned men have done the ſame before me, which therefore I thought fit briefly to comprize and joyn as an auxiliary Appendix to the foreſaid Epitomy, and thoſe things eſpecially, which concern the Principles and Foundations of natural Philoſophy, not only general, but ſpecial alſo. For the chief cauſe why natural Philoſophy is ſo little improved, I conceive to be, that in the former Ages thoſe who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted themſelves the moſt acute, conſumed the greateſt part of their life in thoſe general Queſtions, concerning the firſt Matter, Form, Privation, Motion, and ſuch like, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted the time in repeating thoſe Diſputations over and over again, after a moſt tedious manner; but things particular or the ſorts of natural things (out of the Obſervation wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they ought nevertheleſs to have conſtituted their principles) they never medled withall to any purpoſe. And hence it came to paſs that ſo many Wainloads of Commentaries aroſe upon</hi> Ariſtotle<hi>'s books of general natural Philoſophy, filled for the moſt part with Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons rather Metaphyſical than Natural, and many times with vain ſpeculations. But few were found that would read or Comment upon</hi> Ariſtotle<hi>'s books of Meteors, of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of living things, of the Parts of living things, of the Generation of living things, or of Plants; ſcarce ſo many in number,</hi>
                  <q>As Gates of <hi>Thebes,</hi> or Heads of fruitful <hi>Nile.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And although I know, that by theſe my endeavors I ſhal lay my ſelf open to the Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of many, and that I ſhal be counted an Innovator and an Inventer of Paradoxes: yet. I have not thought fit therefore to forſake the ſtudy of truth. For</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>wel ſaies in</hi> 1. Ethicorum cap. 4. It is a good thing, yea and our Duty, for maintainance of Truth, to change and aboliſh out former Opinions and Tenets. <hi>Which things he taught not only by word and writing, but by Deed and Action. For although</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>heard</hi> Plato <hi>teach twenty yeers together; yet he ſuffered not himſelf to be brought into bondage by the Authority of his Maſter, but he freely enquired into the Tenets of him and al other Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers before him, oppoſed them at pleaſure and rejected them, ſubſtituting in their rooms ſuch things as he thought moſt probable.</hi> And <hi>therefore we that follow, do ow no more Reverence to</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>than he did to his Predeceſſors; but we ought ſo to follow</hi> Ariſtotle, <hi>as that we do not love him better than the Truth.</hi> Galen <hi>boaſts of himſelf that he was alwaies of a free ſpirit, and preferred Truth before the Doctrine of</hi> Hippocrates, Plato, Ariſtotle, <hi>and the wits of other Men. And are we all born Servants and Slaves to other Mens opinions? 'Tis excellently ſpoke by</hi> Seneca: They have done many things who are gone before us, but they have not done all. There remains yet much work behind, and much wil remain; nor ſhal any man born a thouſand Ages ſince want occaſion to add ſomwhat. <hi>And above all things this ſhall be my endeavor, that all my Diſcourſes of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Philoſophy may tend to the honor and Glory of the moſt good and great God. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whom I am admoniſhed by St.</hi> Paul, Rom. 2. <hi>verſe</hi> 20. His inviſible things are ſeen by the Creation of the World, being underſtood by the things which are made, viz. his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Power and God-head, to the end they might be without excuſe. And <hi>Mercurius Triſmegiſtus:</hi> Man is made a Spectator of the works of God, and he hath wondred at them and acknowledged the Creator. <hi>And again in his Book</hi> do Pietate &amp; Philoſophia: there
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:35070:125"/>can be no more true Godlineſs than to Underſtand the things that are, and glorifie the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor for them: <hi>and preſently after;</hi> Be Godly O Son; he that is Godly is a Philoſopher in the higheſt degree. For it is impoſſible to be eminently Godly without Philoſophy. But he that learns what things there are in the World, how diſpoſed and by whom, and for whoſe ſake, he wil give thanks to the Work-Maſter as to a good Father, tender Nurſe, and faithful Steward: and he that gives thanks is Godly. And he that is Godly wil know where the Truth is, and what it is; and the more he knows the more Godly he wil be; <hi>viz. With ſuch a kind of Godlineſs as may be attained from the Principles of Natural Philoſophy, Theoretical and Practical. For who can chooſe but be Godly who truly diſcerns the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Omnipotency, Goodneſs, and Wiſdom of God?

Now two kinds of Principles of Natural things muſt neceſſarily be conſidered and underſtood,
<note place="margin">Two man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Principles of Natural things.</note> 
                     <hi>viz.</hi> Thoſe of their Original and firſt Creation, and thoſe of their duration or continuance. The firſt kind of Principles muſt by any means be diligently conſidered, and he that enquires into the firſt Principles muſt neceſſarily enquire into God himſelf.
<note place="margin">The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher muſt know God to be the firſt Principle of all things:</note> For he is the Firſt of all, and the Principle of al other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, having created al things Natural, and preſerving them when created; ſo that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to this very day that Eſſence which he gave them at their firſt Creation. And herein chiefly moſt of al the Heathen Philoſophers are deficient or very barren, and no mention at al (or but on the by) of God the firſt Author of Nature; and they ſo deſcribe the whol Courſe of Nature as if al were performed without a firſt Cauſe, only by the action of ſecond Cauſes, and indeed contrary Principles. <hi>Socrates</hi> raiſed his mind a little higher, when a little before his death, as <hi>Plato</hi> relates in his <hi>Phaedo,</hi> having heard out of a certain Book of <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> that there was a certain Mind which diſpoſes and rules al things, and is the Cauſe of all; he ſaid he was much delighted with this Cauſe; adding moreover, that thoſe men exceedingly erred who reſted in the ſecond Cauſes and neglected the firſt. And he cals the Mind, or God, the Cauſe indeed; as without which the other Cauſes termed ſecond Cauſes, are no Cauſes.</p>
                  <p>As to what concerns theſe ſecond Cauſes,
<note place="margin">the ſecond Cauſes:</note> or the Continuation and Conſervation of things created; ſince ſome Natural Things keep their Eſſence entire, ſuch as they were created at the beginning of the World without any mutation; but other things are preſerved only in
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:35070:125"/>their kinds, their particulars being ſubject to continual Corruption and Generation; we muſt alſo conſider the latter kind of Principles, viz. The Principles of corruption and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</p>
                  <p>As to the firſt kind of Principle,
<note place="margin">The World created by God:</note> ſince al things (as al in their Wits grant) are governed by the Providence of God alone; they muſt alſo of neceſſity depend on him as their effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; and ſeeing before any Natural things were made, there could be nothing but the moſt good and great God, we muſt needs hold that he is the firſt Author of all Natural things; who, when there was nothing beſides himſelf, and there was no matter for him to work upon, by his Infinite Goodneſs, Wiſdom, and Power, he commanded thoſe things that were nor; to be made. Which thing alſo the more ſound Philoſophers granted after their manner, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they did not cleerly enough explain the matter it ſelf. Not to ſpeak of others, <hi>Plato</hi> t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>uly approved of the Original of the World, although he with-held his aſſent from ſome things concerning the ſame. For he conſtantly affirms, That the World did not proceed from Nature, nor from Fortune, nor was made by Hap-hazard, but that it flowed from the Wil of God, not bound by any neceſſity. But whether from Eternity a certain Matter did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from God, and was al at once formed into this variety of things, or being at firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, after an infinite tract of Time, he did adorn it with ſo many Forms, or, which is the only thing that remains, he performed both in Time, he neither ſaies nor denies, and reaſons in ſuch a manner of the Original of the World, that which way ſoever you turn and wind al that Diſputation which he makes thereof in his <hi>Timaeus,</hi> it wil ſeem to ſavor al theſe Opinions. Which alſo may be ſaid of the Opinions of other Philoſophers before <hi>Plato.</hi> And hence it came to paſs that the Philoſophers which came after <hi>Plato</hi> were of ſundry Opinions hereabout. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> truly, though he acknowledg God to be the Maker of the World, when in the 2. <hi>de Generat. &amp; Corrupt. cap.</hi> 10. <hi>text.</hi> 19. he writes; <hi>God hath filled the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe:</hi> and in the 30. Section of his Problems, the 5. Problem; <hi>God hath given us two Inſtruments in our ſelves, by help of which we might make uſe of external In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments:</hi> yet he endeavors conſidently and openly by divers Reaſons to deny, That God made the World new and in time; and to overthrow the Opinions of the Ancients touching the Original of the World. And therefore though he acknowledg God the Author of the World, yet herein learned men conceive he contradicts himſelf, ſince Eternity is a durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on proper to God alone, nor can a Creature be co-eternal with the Creator; not can there be two Infinites, nor wil right Reaſon allow us to make the World equal to God. And hence a grievous controverſie hath been raiſed amongſt the Peripateticks concerning the mind of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in this point, nor have they as yet wel decided the Controverſie. For there are two things principally which al Philoſophers in a manner cannot underſtand, viz. How the World could be made of nothing, and how it could be made in time; for when they ſaw other Artificers make their Works by mixing ſome things, and taking away other things; they imagined that God alſo had thus made the World. And therefore though they gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted God to be the Author of the World; yet they held there were before the Original of the World certain bodies, either floating up and down in the immenſe Space, or lying hid in a certain confuſed Chaos and Medley. But they were both ignorant who made thoſe bodies:
<note place="margin">The World created of nothing</note> and if they grant God to be infinite, they might believe he could produce ſomthing even of nothing; eſpecially ſince there was nothing before any matter imaginable, but he.</p>
                  <p>Another thing which offends them is,
<note place="margin">the World was made in time:</note> That they think it abſurd that God ſhould be ſo long a time idle before the Worlds Creation, and at laſt ſet himſelf upon a new work. But ſince in Eternity there is neither fore nor after, it could not be made before it was made, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it ſhould be made from Eternity. But to be made, and to be made from Eternity imply a contradiction. And if you ask why the World was made five thouſand years ago, and not twenty thouſand years ago? I ask again, Suppoſing it was created twenty thouſand years ago, why not an hundred thouſand years ago? and if an hundred thouſand years ago, why not an hundred thouſand thouſand years, and ſo ſtil forwards, unleſs it had been made from Eternity, which cannot be? For Eternity is a point wherein there is no going before or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming after. But the Philoſophers could not by the reaſons meerly of Nature and their own underſtandings, come to know the power of the moſt good and great God, who acts above the powers of Nature. But we may know theſe things very wel out of the holy Scriptures,
<note place="margin">the Uſe of the holy Scriptures in natural Philoſophy</note> the uſe whereof is by the goodneſs of God afforded unto us; and therefore thoſe things in which the Philoſophers are defective muſt be ſupplied from them. For though the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are not written to interpret the things of Nature: yet inaſmuch as thoſe things which are written by <hi>Moſes</hi> touching the Creation of the World, were dictated by Inſpiration of the holy Ghoſt; we muſt needs think that al thoſe things which we read in the Hiſtory of
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:35070:126"/>the Creation are moſt true: and that it is impious to ſuppoſe any thing there ſaid to ſwerve an hairs breadth from the Truth. And ſuppoſe (which I do not now diſpute) that every where in holy Scripture we meet with ſome things which are ſpoke according to the Opinion of Men, and either Tropically or otherwiſe Figuratively according to the Capacity of the common people: yet that cannot any waies be ſaid of the Creation of the World, becauſe God would have that made known to Men only as it is comprehended in this Writing of <hi>Moſes,</hi> even to the end of the World. And although the primary ſcope of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is to propound the means to eternal Salvation: yet the Hiſtory of the Creation of the World is not to be excluded from thoſe means, as the Apoſtle teaches in the <hi>Romans,</hi> chap. 1. verſe 20. ſeeing withal there are therein ſuch Revelations of Natural things, as to which no ſharpneſs of Humane Wit could ever be able to attain. An Example whereof the Creation of the World, and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf, do afford. For let us ſuppoſe as <hi>Julius Caeſar Scaliger</hi> conceits, that Nature hath in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> made oſtentation of al the Wit Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Kind is capable of; yet he could never attain to know the Creation of the World, as the moſt learned Peripatericks confeſs. And therefore to depart from the evident ſence of Scripture and to aſſent to Pagans, is neither Lawful nor Godly. And although it be indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent as to Eternal Life, what Opinion any Man holds in the things of Nature, and in this darkneſs of the minds of mortal men it can be no prejudice to a mans attainment of Eternal Life, if out of weakneſs of Underſtanding he err in this point: yet if any man does witting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contradict the holy Scriptures, and eſteems the Authority of an Heathen more than the holy Writ, I conceive that queſtionleſs he ſins very grievouſly. Truly <hi>Galen</hi> cannot (nor ought he by any Chriſtian Philoſopher or Phyſitian) be excuſed who in his ſecond Book of the difference of Pulſes, chap. 4. carps at the School of <hi>Moſes</hi> and of Chriſt, as delivering Laws not founded upon any Demonſtration. And in his Book 11. <hi>de uſu partium,</hi> where he diſputes of the Hairs of the Eye-brows, he derides <hi>Moſes,</hi> as if God the Creator had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded theſe Hairs alone to keep alwaies an even ſize, and that they as fearing the power of the preſcriber, or reverencing God himſelf that gave them that command, or being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that it was beſt to do thus, they did as they were commanded. And afterwards he reprehends <hi>Moſes</hi> for ſuppoſing that God could make all things, although he would make an Horſe or an Ox of aſhes; and he holds and determines that God himſelf never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes any thing which Nature cannot effect, and affirms that the Hairs of the Eyelids would not have been ſuch as they are if they had ſprung out of the ſoft skin, though God ſhould have willed and commanded the ſame a thouſand times. Well therefore did that ſame fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Philoſopher and Phyſitian <hi>Franciſcus Valleſius,</hi> who in the Proeme of his Book <hi>de ſacra Philoſophia,</hi> is not aſhamed ingenuouſly to confeſs, That when he was a yong man he wrote Matters Philoſophical (viz. When he commented upon the Phyſicks of <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>) according to Opinion (that is the Mind of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and his Interpreters) but that he writes theſe things according to the Truth, that is to ſay, agreeable to the Hiſtory of the Creation in holy Scripture, ſeeing before he could have no certainty concerning the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Natural things before he knew them by reading the holy Scripture, to the reading whereof he had conſecrated his old Age. And I have been long of the mind, That he who not knowing, or neglecting the Creation of the World, ſhal undertake a Diſpute of the things of Nature, he ſhalerr in many things; yea, and that many upon that occaſion have fallen into moſt grievous Errors.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Moſes</hi> hath deſcribed the Hiſtory of the Creation in the firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Things to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the explication of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the World</note> the Interpretation whereof to ſet down in this place, I count not worth the while; ſince there are many large Commentaries extant thereupon, and amongſt the reſt that of <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcus Valleſius,</hi> which though it be ſhort is none of the worſt. Only I ſhal adviſe you of one thing; That there are many who affix a wrong Interpretation upon the Text of <hi>Moſes,</hi> whiles they endeavor to expound <hi>Moſes,</hi> not by <hi>Moſes,</hi> but from the Writings of Heathen, an unhappy and intollerable deſign. For it is certain amongſt al Chriſtians, that al things delivered in the holy Scriptures are true, and thoſe delivered by <hi>Moſes</hi> (being plainly Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical) are to be underſtood according to the proper and genuine ſenſe of the words, as they are commonly underſtood in the Holy Scriptures; and not to be explained according to pre-conceived Opinions ſucked in by reading Heatheniſh Authors: nor is the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute to be wreſted to ſuch Opinions. And therefore <hi>Auguſtine</hi> gives a good warning in the beginning of his ſecond Book upon <hi>Geneſis,</hi> that we take heed leſt we contend, not for the ſence of the holy Scripture, but for our own Opinion, ſo that we would make that to be the Opinion of the Scripture which is our Opinion; whereas we ſhould rather be willing to make that our Opinion which is found to be the ſence of the Scripture. The Hiſtory (truly)
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:35070:126"/>of the Creation is not repugnant to Nature, but it is many times oppoſite to the falle Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions which Men have of Nature; concerning which the ſame <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his ſeventh Epiſtle to <hi>Marcellus</hi> thus writes: If a reaſon be given contrary to the Authority of the holy Scriptures, be it never ſo acute, yet does it deceive by an appearance or ſimilitude of Truth. For it cannot be true. Again, if a man does oppoſe the Authority (as it were) of the holy Scriptures againſt moſt manifeſt and certain Reaſon, he that does ſo underſtands not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and he does not object the ſence of thoſe Scriptures which he cannot dive into, but his own ſence againſt the Truth; nor does he oppoſe what is in them, but what he ſinds in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in their ſtead as it were. And therefore although it ſeems hard to many to abandon ſome Hypotheſes of Natural Philoſophers, becauſe they agree not with the Hiſtory of the Creation of the World: yet is it altogether neceſſary ſo to do, ſeeing there are ſome things in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> contrary to the Hiſtory of the Creation of the World. For as <hi>Benedictus Pererius</hi> (an excellent Ariſtotelean) hath ingenuouſly written, <hi>de Com. Rerum Nat. princip. Lib. 5 cap.</hi> 7. nothing can be found out or imagined which is more contrary to the Doctrine of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and which does more vehemently break al his Joynts and Nerves, than the Creation of the World. And a little before; When the Peripatericks perceived that a Creation being allowed, moſt grievous inconveniences would follow againſt their matter, they could by no means be induced to grant the ſame. And he who wil examme ſome Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſhal eaſily perceive that <hi>Pererius</hi> was not miſtaken when he ſo thought and wrote. And he ſhal ſee the ſame (not to ſpeak now of the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>ARiſtotle</hi> in the firſt of his Phyſicks, chap. 6.
<note place="margin">Whether the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are contrary?</note> preſuppoſes this as a thing granted by all Men, That the Principles of Natural things ought to be contraries. Now he was perſwaded to hold this Opinion, either becauſe he beleeved that the generation of al Natural things was performed by the action of Contraries, and that when one contrary overcomes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, this thing periſhes, and another is generated; or becauſe he would inſiſt in that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod by him pointed out in <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Phyſicor.</hi> and proceed from things moſt known to us, to ſearch out the Natures of things. But ſome Expoſitors of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> have long ſince told us that this propoſition is not univerſal, nor hath place in al Phyſical things. For ſince the World hath two ſorts of Parts, ſome that have remained incorruptible and unchangable to this very day, viz. The Heaven and the Stars; ſome corruptible, whoſe Individuals are generated and corrupted, yet the kind is preſerved by a continual ſucceſſion of the ſaid Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals; it eaſily appears, how thoſe principles belong to the Heaven and Stars.
<note place="margin">the End and uſe of Matter.</note> As for Matter, it belongs indeed to the Heaven, but not by a definite contrariety, but only affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Magnitude. For (which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> wil not deny) the end of matter is to be the Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle of Forms, both ſubſtantial and accidental; and therefore in 2. <hi>Phyſ. cap.</hi> 8. <hi>text.</hi> 81. he terms the Form the End of the Matter; and the ſame Matter gives corpulency and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinate magnitude to things, and hath an aptitude to receive Forms, and a determinate figure, and of it ſelf is no waies the Cauſe of Generation and corruption, but receives thoſe effects from ſome Agent, or as <hi>Scaliger</hi> writes in <hi>Exercitat.</hi> 61. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>Matter was not given primarily and of it ſelf, for to cauſe a tranſmutation to generation; ſo that where ever it is, there alſo Generation ſhould be; but to be the ſubject of the form of Corporiety in a ſubſtance, and to receive Quantity and Figure: Quantity in regard of change of place; Figure, becauſe every body muſt and ought to be finite.</hi> And a little after, <hi>For theſe Cauſes Matter (by a primary Councel of God) was created; but ſecondarily, and as to a leſs noble end, for Generation.</hi> And therefore although Matter belongs to al Natural things; yet, that the Principles of Natural things ſhould be contrary does not belong to al; ſince in the Heavens and Stars (according to the Opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf) there is no Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and no contrariety, which might be the cauſe of Generation and Corruption. And therefore Principles with a definite and determinate Contrariety are not the moſt general, but do belong only to bodies ſubject to Generation and Corruption.</p>
                  <pb n="420" facs="tcp:35070:127"/>
                  <p> Moreover, they do not belong to al corruptible and mutable things neither, but to ſuch alone as are made by the action of contraries, and not to ſuch as are made of ſeed. And touching this very Contrariety of Principles, and concerning them how they are contrary, the Peripateticks themſelves are at great variance; of which ſee their Commentaries. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, the moſt of them do not place a true Contrariety in the firſt Principles, but ſuch an oppoſition as is between the Habit and Privation, as <hi>Zabarella</hi> writes in his firſt Book <hi>de materia prima, cap.</hi> 2. and thus of an Egg which is no Chick, a Chick; and of Wood which is no Statue, a Statue; and of Potters Clay a Pot they ſay is made, and that Generation is a paſſage from a Privative to a Poſitive Eſſence.</p>
                  <p>But in good deed, thus going to work they have not ſufficiently explained the Doctrine of the Generation of things, nor have they ſufficiently laid down the Cauſes of Generation. For in the firſt place thoſe examples which they bring of Artificial things, as when a ſtool or ſtatue is made of Wood, a Pot of Potters Clay, a Globe of Wax, and ſuch like, are all to be rejected: ſeeing they are not produced by operation Natural, but are the works of Art. Moreover, although we ſhould admit a Contrariety in things Natural, in regard of their forms, by which many actions and Sympathies and Antipathies are cauſed, as Water is contrary to Fire, and Plants are killed by the Cold; yet from that very Contrariety a Cauſe of the Generation of al things cannot be rendred, nor is that Generation which is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily intended, accompliſhed by the Action of Contraries; and therefore it cannot be granted that contrary Principles muſt be conſtituted for every Generation. For that a Sheep produces a Sheep, a Plum produces a Plum, does not proceed from the Action of Contraries.</p>
                  <p>And therefore although the Expoſitors of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> having canvaſſed the matter to and fro concerning the Contrariety of Principles, do at laſt conclude, That one Contrary is not made of another, as of the term from whence, but that one Contrary is made after another; as for example, Cold after Hot; yet that term infers no cauſality, and affords nothing to the production of the thing, and therefore cannot be called a contrary Principle.</p>

<note place="margin">the Form the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Cauſe of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> our great Care muſt be to find out a Principle which is the efficient Cauſe and principal Agent in the Generation of al things. Verily (that I may not ſeem injurious to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) I muſt needs confeſs, that he in <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Ort. &amp; Interit. cap.</hi> 9. <hi>text.</hi> 53. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as alſo in the end of the 4. of <hi>Meteors,</hi> reprehends the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, becauſe they did teach the Generation of things to be cauſed by the firſt Qualities, too inſtrumentally, omitting the Cauſe taken from the Form, and doing juſt as if a man ſhould attribute to the Saw, Hatchet, and ſuch like Inſtruments, the things made by them. But I could wiſh that in the beginning of his Phyſicks he had made larger mention of that Cauſe, or at leaſt that his Expoſitors had from other places of his Works explained what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> taught in his Acroamaticks concerning the Principles of Natural things. For ſo doubtleſs they would have enquired thereinto, and would not have been ſo content with the action of contrary Principles, and taught that the Generations of things were ſo inſtrumentally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by them. Yea, and it were to be wiſhed that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf had been more ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous about that Cauſe, or had more largely explained the ſame, and not extended too far the action of the firſt Qualities. At the end indeed of the 4. of his Meteors he plainly laies open his mind; where he attributes the Generation of ſimilar parts in Animals to the action of the firſt Qualities, but the Generation of the diſſimilar parts alone he attributes to a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Agent, while he thus writes: Such parts happen to be made by Heat and Cold and their motions; being compacted by the power of Heat and Cold. Now I mean thoſe parts which are ſimilar, as Fleſh, Bones, Hairs, Nerves, and al that are like to theſe. For they are al diffinguiſhed by thoſe differences which we mentioned before, viz. Tenſion, Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Comminution, Hardneſs, Softneſs, and others of the ſame kind. For ſuch parts I ſay are made by heat and cold and mixt motions. But no man can imagine that the diſſimilar parts, as the Head, or Hand, or Foot, are conſtitured of them: but as the motion of Cold and Heat is the Cauſe why Braſs or Silver are made, but not of the making of a Saw, Glafs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bottle, or Box; but of theſe Art, of the other Nature, or ſome other Cauſe: and ſo it will be thought to be the cauſe that thoſe things are made. But whether this Doctrine of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> be perfectly currant, I leave to the Reader to judg. <hi>Galen</hi> (truly) and other Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:35070:127"/>aſcribe not only the Formation of the diſſimilar parts to the Soul; but alſo they attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute thereto a blood-making, fleſh-making, bone-making, nerve-making Faculty; and doubtleſs they are therein in the right. And who can beleeve that Gold, Silver, Iron, are generated principally and ſolely by Heat and Cold; and that the efficiency of the Form is not added. Moreover, neither hath he ſufficiently declared what that ſpecifick cauſe is in the Generation of things, but neglecting the ſame he often runs to the Univerſal Cauſe. For in his Book <hi>de Generat. &amp; Corrup. cap.</hi> 10. and the following Chapters, he makes no mention thereof, but after he hath rejected the Opinions of the Ancients, and would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce his own, he flies to the Motion of the Heaven; and after he hath taught that the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Heaven is perpetual, thence he concludes by way of Conſequence, That rather that which is ſhould be the Cauſe of that which is not, than that which is not the Cauſe of that which is; and that that which alwaies is, ſhould make and produce that which is not and is generated. But at the beginning of the World, neither did the motion of Heaven make things Sublunary, nor now being only an univerſal Cauſe does it produce the ſorts of things. For God in the firſt Creation gave to things their Forms,
<note place="margin">The firſt Original of Forms.</note> by which the Order of Generation is continued and perfected; and theſe Forms are juſtly held to be the Agent Principle, and as the Expoſitors of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> themſelves do hold, have a power to multiply themſelves; and al the Generation of Natural things depends upon the multiplication and propagation of Souls, by reaſon of the Faculty which by the Almighty power of God was put into them at the firſt Creation, when God ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Let the Earth bring forth Graſs, the Herb yielding ſeed, and the Fruit-tree yielding Fruit after his kind, whoſe ſeed is in it ſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth: and it was ſo. And the Earth brought forth Graſs, and the Herb yielding ſeed after his kind, and the Tree yielding Fruit, whoſe ſeed was in it ſelf, after its kind.</hi> And in verſe 22. he ſaid to the Fiſhes and Birds; <hi>Encreaſe and multiply, and fill the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the Seas, and let Fowl multiply in the Earth. And God made the Beaſt of the Earth after his kind, and every thing that creepeth on the Earth after his kind: and God ſaw that it was good.</hi> And to Man-kind he ſaid, verſe 28. <hi>Encreaſe and multiply, and fill the Earth.</hi> Alſo in verſe 29. <hi>Bebold I have given you every Herb bearing ſeed, which is upon the face of all the Earth, and every Tree in which is the fruit of a Tree yielding ſeed,</hi> But as to the manner of Generation; The generation of Plants and Animals does ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare, that their Generation is not cauſed by the action of contraries one upon another, but by the communication of Souls, or by Seed which perfects the Fabrick of its own body, not primarily by the action of contraries, but by attraction of things friendly and of kin, and the expulſion of things having Enmity. For, that the body of ſome Plant or Animal is made, does not come to paſs by the only concourſe and fighting of the Elements. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, as <hi>J. Caeſar Scaliger,</hi> in <hi>Exercit.</hi> 307. <hi>Sect.</hi> 20. rightly teaches, <hi>Thoſe four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have a Governor, they will both toſs and be toſſed raſhly without manner or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. For what is that which mixes juſt ſo much Earth, and ſo much of the other Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? But there ought to be in every motion one firſt mover. For they cannot move them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Production of any work; but in Compounds they are moved by the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Form to Generation, and in imperfect mixt Bodies by an external Principle they are moved to a mutual connexion.</hi> For inſtance, when the Seeds of Plants are caſt into the ground, the Elements do not then begin to fight that they may make the Body of a Plant, but each particular ſeed draws out of the Earth ſuch nouriſhment as is to its own Nature agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſome that which is harſh, others that which is bitter, ſweet, ſalt, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> writes in his Book <hi>de Natura Humana:</hi> whence the whol Plant is formed, nouriſhed, and attains to its growth.</p>
                  <p>Yea, and even <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf when he treats of Generation,
<note place="margin">The firſt Qualities are only an inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Agent in Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> cannot reſt in the firſt Qualities, but is compelled to ad an higher Agent, viz. The Soul, even in the Generation of the ſimilar parts, whiles in <hi>2. de Generat. Animal. cap.</hi> 1. he writes: <hi>Even as we do not ſay that an Hatchet or other Inſtrument is made by the fire alone: So neither the Foot nor the Hand, no nor ſo much as the Fleſh. For it alſo hath ſome office. Hardneſs therefore and ſoftneſs, clammineſs, ſtifneſs, and whatever other diſpoſitions are in the parts animated, may be produced by heat and coldneſs: but that whereby it is Fleſh or a Bone cannot: but it is ſo made by a motion proceeding from the Generator, which is actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that thing, which the thing whereof Generation is made is potentially or by way of aptitude; as we ſee it is alſo in things Artificial. For Iron is made bard or ſoft by cold or heat; but a Sword is made by the motion of Artificial Inſtruments, which motion hath in it the Nature of the Art. For Art is the Principle and Form of that which is effected, but in another. But the motion of Nature is in is ſelf, proceeding from another Nature,
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:35070:128"/>which hath the Form actually.</hi> And as was ſaid but even now, in 2. <hi>de Generat. &amp; Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt. cap.</hi> 9. <hi>text.</hi> 53, 54, 55. he reckons Heat, Cold, and ſuch like Qualities for Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſaies they generate <hi>after a very Inſtrumental manner;</hi> and he writes that ſuch as attribute Generation to them, do juſt as if a man ſhould make a Saw, Ax, or any other Inſtrument the Cauſe of all thoſe things made thereby.</p>
                  <p>And juſt ſo it is with the Elements.
<note place="margin">Whence the Elements have their forms.</note> For when God firſt created the Heaven and the Earth, he firſt ſeparated the Elements, and diſtinguiſhed the Earth from the Water, and ſo gave the Elements their forms. That therefore is falſe which <hi>Zabarella</hi> endeavors to teach out of <hi>Ariſtotle Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Element. cap.</hi> 8. 9. (where he pitifully beats his Brains and vexes himſelf, and yet cannot make it appear how the firſt Qualities which flow from their forms can be before them; nor doth he ſeek after Truth in the thing it ſelf, but how he may find ſuch an Opinion as the words of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> can bear) that this Elementary world hath nothing of it ſelf but Aptitude or Potentiality; and whatever it hath of act, it receives from the Heavens; and that the whol matter of this inferior world is potentially Hot, Cold, Moiſt, Dry; but is actually made ſuch by Immobility the motion and of the Heavens; growing hot by the motion of Heaven, and cold by the want of that motion; and that after the firſt Qualities (which are the preparations for the eduction of Forms) the forms of the Elements do follow, and that ſo the Elements are made and continue ſuch (according to the Opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) from Eternity. The holy Scriptures, as hath been ſaid, do teach us better that the Elements were created at the Beginning, and that all things have their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and forms whereby they differ one from another, and whereby they are able to operate, from the firſt Creation, and preſerve the ſame to this very day, by the good wil and pleaſure of the good and great God.</p>
                  <p>From all which it appears, that God in the firſt Creation gave to all natural Bodies their matter and Form. To which if ſome would afford their Conſideration, they would think otherwiſe than they do concerning the original of Forms. For it is an opinion ſufficiently common,
<note place="margin">Whether Forms are drawn out of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titode of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</note> for which ſome plead as if their Life and Salvation lay on it, that forms are drawn out of the power or aptitude of the Matter, which is nevertheleſs built upon no ſure Reaſons, as I have ſhewed <hi>in my Epitomy of Natural Philoſophy, Book</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. and as I ſhal ſhew hereafter in <hi>my Fourth Diſcourſe touching the Original of living things,</hi> chap. 4. Here I ſhal add nothing, but that this Opinion had its original from the Ignorance of the Creation of the world. For ſince they knew not whence all natural things ſhould receive their forms, and that they had by command of the Creator a power to multiply themſelves; they invented this original of them. Moſt indeed do give this out for an Ariſtotelick tenet, but with <hi>Bon-Amicus</hi> and others, Dr. <hi>Caſper Hofmannus,</hi> a man excellently verl'd in <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi> ſaies it is a tener of <hi>Averrboes,</hi> in <hi>Tract. de Origine Form. neer the end.</hi> Yet the ſaid <hi>Hofmannus</hi> in the ſame place doth produce ſome texts out of <hi>Averrhoes,</hi> wherein he holds the efficient cauſe of Generation to be the form contained in the Seed: ſo that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Tenet ſeems rather to have had its original from the Schoolmen. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is verily of another mind in this point, who though he admits the Heaven as an univerſal Cauſe, yet he adds an immediate Cauſe, when he writes, that the Sun and Man generate a man. And in 2. <hi>Phyſ. cap.</hi> 3. <hi>text</hi> 31. he hath theſe words expreſsly concerning Seed: <hi>The Seed and the Phyſitian, and the Conſulter, and whatever, is Efficient, all theſe are the Cauſes whence the Beginning of Mutation, of Reſt and Motion doth proceed.</hi> And <hi>Scaliger</hi> produces more ſuch Places in <hi>Exercit.</hi> 6. <hi>ſect.</hi> 2. of which alſo mention is made hereafter, where we ſhal ſpeak <hi>of the Generation of Living things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now two things chiefly brought the School-men into this Opinion:
<note place="margin">Whence that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion aroſe, of drawing Forms out of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> the firſt it that they beleeved, as was ſaid before from <hi>Zabarella, Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Element. Qualitat. cap.</hi> 9. and as they indeed ſuppoſe, according to the mind of <hi>Ariſtotle, Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Meteor. cap.</hi> 4. that this Elementary world hath nothing of it ſelf but aptitude or potentiality; and that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it hath of act, it receives from Heaven; and if at any time all the Elements were at firſt generated, and began to be what they are, they were generated by the Heavens; and becauſe according to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> Generation never began, that they are perpetually made and preſerved ſuch by the Heavens.</p>
                  <p>The other is becauſe they endeavored to prove their natural Principles by examples drawn from the production of things natural (which kind of Examples though <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath uſed in his Phyſicks and Metaphyſicks, yet we muſt think he intends thereby only to illuſtrate, not to prove that Doctrine:) for when they ſaw a Statue or Image made by the Carvers paring ſomwhat off, and adding if need were ſomwhat, and that when the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer had done his work at laſt, the very moment he leaves off the Form reſults from
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:35070:128"/>al that hath been done: they thought after the ſame manner, that by the action of ſome exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Agent (yet what that Agent ſhould be they have not cleerly enough explained, lurking under the general term of Nature, whereas a ſpecifick cauſe ought to be rendred of every ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick Effect) ſome diſpoſition was brought into the matter, upon the final perfection where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the form ſprung up in a moment: and they ſaid that it was drawn out of the power or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the matter. But they were herein in a very great Error:
<note place="margin">The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial and natural Effects.</note> For when of Wood a Bench is made, or a Statue; or a Jug is made of Earth, a Globe of Wax, there is nothing induced but a certain Accident, Quality or Shape, and there is then no power of the matter ſave obediential. But here the Queſtion is concerning the original of a Subſtance. Yet the Production of even artificial things might have brought them to the knowledg of the generation of natural things if they would have weighed the matter more accurately. For as artificial things are produced by an actual Agent, according to a determinate Idea in the mind of the Artificer, and ſo every thing is not made by every Artiſt, but a Carver makes one kind of work, a Box-maker makes another kind: a Carpenter makes another: ſo alſo to the generation of every natural thing a determinate and ſpecificial Agent is requiſite, and one that is an Agent actually which according to the Power given it by its Creator (as the Artiſt works according to the Idea or Pattern in his mind) makes a work like it ſelf. Herein only is the difference, that the Artiſt in the artificial generation is without the matter: but in things natural, the Artiſt is in the matter, and diffuſed through the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as <hi>Galen</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>de Cauſis procat. &amp; Cauſis pulſuum.</hi> Nor can any external thing, whatever they ſhal ſeign, be admitted for a determinate cauſe, ſince none is like unto and (as they ſay) univocal to the thing generated, or hath at leaſt that ſimilitude to the thing genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted which the Pattern in the mind of the Artiſt hath to his work, be it Statue, Pot, Bench, or what ever. For indeed Nature is an intrinſecal Art; Art an extrinſecal Nature. Now Nature hath this Art from God, the foot-ſteps and Prints of whoſe wildom appear every where, in Men, in Bees, in Primites, in the leaves and flowers of Trees, and al natural things whatſoever upon which the Creator hath imprinted his Image when he gave them Forms. For every Form is a participation and Image (after its manner) of the Power, and Wiſdom, and Goodneſs, and Love of God: and every Being or thing, by its form, hath a deſire to be, a Knowledg how to be, and a Power to be. And all things natural have by their forms whatever they have, and from the form proceeds the whol Fabrick of the Body, and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of Accidents; and many Qualities which are vulgarly ill attributed to the mixture of the Elements and the temper of tangible Qualities do flow from the Form, and all the furniture of the Body proceeds from the Form, as I ſhal hereafter ſhew more at large in the 4. and 6. Diſcourſes of this work.</p>
                  <p>And although in the Forms of things we meet with many Particulars worthy of admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<note place="margin">The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties of Forms.</note> yet forms have chiefly three Proprieties which are diligently to be obſerved: The firſt is, that the Form of it ſelf hath no Quantity, not can it be divided; and the ſame can be as eſſentially entire and compleat in a ſmal Quantity, as in a great Bulk; and in the ſmalleſt Atome or indiviſible Particle of Fire, or Water, is as perfect as in a great Quantity of either; and in a ſmal Seed of Poppy or Tobacco, as in a great Plant of either; or to avoid all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of cavilling, in a little Sprig ſpouting from an Aco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> ſet in the Ground, the form of an Oak is as perfect and compleat as in the tall and hard Oak afterwards: nor is the Soul which is in a ſmall Seed or Shoot, leſſer than that which is afterwards in a tall Tree: nor is that in an high Tree greater than that in a ſmal Seed or Branch.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Yet is the form extended according to the extenſion of the Matter, or rather the form fils its whol Matter: For whereas, that I may demonſtrate this by the Example of Plants, the whol Body of the Plant lives, is noutiſhed, grows; the ſoul which was as firſt in a ſmal Twig, diffuſes it ſelf (its nature becoming no bigger) into the nouriſhment newly adjoyned; and where ever the Body is which lives, there the Soul is rightly ſaid to be; and the plenitude (if I may ſo ſpeak) or Replency of the Soul is juſt ſo great as the living body, and the dimenſions thereof. For ſince no act is performed without ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Agent; where ever there is nutrition, there of neceſſity the Soul muſt be. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Augmentation is made, when the pre-exiſtent Soul communicates it ſelf to the afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Aliment, whoſe Bulk reaches further than the Body which is nouriſhed, and diffuſes or ſheds is ſelf abroad thereinto; of neceſſity it muſt be preſent in every part of the whol Body. After the ſame manner the caſe ſtands in Animals. For ſince they are nouriſhed, encreaſed, and endued with the guift of feeling; the ſoul which is but one, muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be in all parts of the Body.</p>
                  <pb n="424" facs="tcp:35070:129"/>
                  <p> Thirdly, But although every form be of it ſelf uncapable of being divided or parted, yet becauſe it is coextended or ſtretched out together with a corporeal body, which hath Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, by the diviſion thereof it becomes capable of number, and is multiplied intomany In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, and every form hath the Power of ſelf-multiplication. Howbeit the manner of that multiplication is not one and the ſame. In ſome Plants in which the ſeminal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is diſperſed through their whol Bodies, the ſoul though of it ſelf not ſubject to Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, is divided after a manner peculiar to it ſelf according to the diviſion of the Matter, and being actually but one in number is manifold potentially, that it hath in it a fitneſs, power, or aptitude to become many and becomes actually manifold, when its Body is divided into many parts; of one Vine many Vines, and of one Willow or Withy many may be made. But in others this ſame Multiplication is cauſed by Seed: of which we ſhal ſpeak more at large in our Diſcourſe <hi>of the Generation of living Things.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>I muſt here alſo ad ſomwhat concerning Privation, which is reckoned amongſt the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of natural things.
<note place="margin">Privation.</note> Since the original of the form is ſuch, as hath been explained juſt now, and ſhal be hereafter explained more at large; Privation unleſs the nature there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of be rightly opened, is in vain reckoned amongſt the Principles of things natural. The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Expoſitors (truly) of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> themſelves do grant, that Privation is not a Principle, otherwiſe than by accident, if you regard the thing it ſelf conſtituted: but if you conſider the Generation thereof, it is of it ſelf a Principle, viz. becauſe it is as a Term from which, (ſince it is the abſence of the form in the immediate Matter) which hath an aptitude to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſame: Which opinions if they are to be allowed, they do ſtand altogether in need of a convenient explication. For that which is wont commonly to be ſaid, that Privation though it belong not of it ſelf to the Eſſence of things to be generated, yet it concurs of it ſelf to natural Mutations, and from it all natural Generation proceeds, ſo that the form doth (as it were) ariſe thereout; that is falſe. The abſence of the form helps nothing to the Generation; but beſides the matter a diſpoſition to receive the form is neceſſary. For eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Form and Soul, ſince from the divine Benediction it hath a faculty to multiply it ſelf, it requires a matter wherein to be propagated, and it diſpoſes and fits the ſame for it ſelf. Plants (for example ſake) produce Seeds or bulbous roots, and Eg-engendring Creatures produce Eggs, other living Creatures produce ſeed, by which they are able to multiply themſelves and to communicate ſomwhat of their Eſſence. If they pleaſe to term this diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition Privation, they ſhal have my conſent. But they do not cleerly enough explain how the Form follows Privation, and whence it proceeds. The Conimbricenſian Collegiates do ſay indeed, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Phyſ. cap.</hi> 9. <hi>Queſt.</hi> 9. <hi>art.</hi> 2. that the matter then only attains an immediate and compleat aptitude, when it is arrived to the Term and Fulneſs of all the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents wherewith it is diſpoſed and fitted by the Agent, which term betides only in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment it ſelf of Generation. And very true (indeed) it is, that diſpoſition of the matter whereby it is fit for the multiplcation of the form is made in time, and at laſt perfected in a moment, nor can the Seed of a Pear or an Apple be termed properly a Seed, til the accompliſhment of the accidents is preſent. But the Form is not abſent while theſe previous diſpoſitions are made, ſo as to reſult, upon their accompliſhment; but it is already preſent, and it ſelf according to the nature of the Body whereof it is a form, fits the matter wherein it may multiply it ſelf, and elaborates the ſame, and in this elaboration ſome ſpace of time is ſpent, more or leſs according to the Nobleneſs or Baſeneſs of the Forms: but when it hath introduced the utmoſt perfection and accompliſhment into the matter, juſt then the Form which before had a power to multiply it ſelf, doth mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply it ſelf actually; as for example ſake, in a Poppy look how many ſeeds are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, ſo many times doth the form of the Poppy multiply it ſelf, and ſo new Plants of Poppy are generated. The ſoul in an unripe ſeed is not different from that in the ſame ſeed when it is ripe; but herein lies the difference, that the ſeed unripe lives only with the ſoul of the Plant; and being ſeparated from the Plant wherein it was bred it cannot exiſt of it ſelf: but a perfect and ripe ſeed is ſo diſpoſed, that though it may be ſeparated from the Plant wherein it is produced, yet it hath the ſame ſoul in it ſelf, and lives now by its own ſoul, ſo that it can exiſt by it ſelf. Of which matter <hi>J. Caeſ. Scaliger</hi> ſaies rightly, <hi>Exercit.</hi> 6. <hi>ſect.</hi> 10. <hi>A Tree</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>engenders, when it produceth ſeed. But the Tree is not then generated when it ſprouts out of the ſeed; but then that which was formerly ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:35070:129"/>and imperfect, is perfected.</hi> But if any man wil thus explain the vulgar Doctrine of Privation, and ſay that after the matter hath received al its accompliſhment of Accidents, then there is a Privation, and that then afterwards in a moment the Form is introduced by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Agent, that man is very much out, as ſhal hereafter be largely declared in its place; and it is ſufficiently proved by <hi>Julius Caeſar Scaliger, Exercit.</hi> 6. <hi>Sect.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p>To be brief: In the firſt place,
<note place="margin">The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Privation explaingd.</note> Privation (however it be explained) does not belong to al Natural things, but to ſuch alone in which there is Generation, and therefore it cannot be numbred amongſt the moſt general Principles of Natural things. For in the Heavens there is no Privation properly ſo called. For ſince it ſuppoſes a ſubject having aptitude to another Form, there is no ſuch aptitude in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Privation (which alſo the Expoſitors of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> themſelves do teach, as may be ſeen in <hi>Tolet. Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Phyſ. cap.</hi> 9. <hi>Queſt.</hi> 21.) is not a Principle of Conſtitution, or which enters the thing generated, to help make it up, but of Generation.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Though it ſhould be admitted for a Principle of Generation; yet they who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Doctrine of the Eduction of Forms out of the aptitude of the matter, cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently ſhew what Privation is. But if we hold the multiplication and propagation of Forms, Privation may (not unfitly) be explained two manner of waies.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all, Since Forms are propagated not without Matter, but with it, and every Form requires a peculiar matter; that ſame laſt diſpoſition to the reception and propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Form may (not altogether unfitly) be called Privation: and it may be thus defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Privation is the abſence of a Form in a Matter which is immediately fitted to receive the ſame. To explain the thing by Examples: In a Stone there is no aptitude to receive the form of an Apple, or of a Dog; and therefore we do not ſay there is the Privation of the form of an Apple or a Dog. So neither is the Soul of a Dog propagated with his Blood, nor the form of an Apple with the pulp or meat thereof, but with the ſeed. And ſeeing the ſeed is not generated in a moment; for examples ſake: The ſeed in an Apple is firſt white, and then it becomes black and ripe, and apt to receive the Soul of an Apple into it, and alſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ſame, being ſeparated from the Tree: in the ſeed already ripe, and which hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in it the ſoul of an Apple, Privation is not ſaid to be becauſe the Soul is already therein; but in that ſame ſeed which is juſt ready to ripen and is immediately fitted to receive the Soul, and to retain it, though it be ſeparated from the Tree, Privation is ſaid to be; and then Privation is that ſame ultimate diſpoſition of the ſeed whereby it is fitted to receive and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate the form of an Apple.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe nevertheleſs in that ſame ripe ſeed the Soul is preſent, at leaſt in its firſt act, and becauſe it wants Organs is not vulgarly called an Apple-tree, as an Egg is not called an Hen for the ſame Reaſon: If any man by reaſon of the abſence of thoſe Organs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to perform the actions of an Apple-tree or an Hen, ſhal cal that diſpoſition which is in the animated ſeed and Egg, to receive the Organs, and exerciſe the actions by a ſecond act, Privation; and hold that in the Eg there is the Privation of an Hen, becauſe there is therein an immediate aptitude to become an Hen, conſiſting of a Soul and perfect Body, I wil not quarrel or contend with that man; provided he grant, that in ſuch a Seed and Egg there is not ſimply a privation of the Soul, ſince it is there not the firſt act, but the Privation of a Soul ſurniſhed with bodily Organs neceſſary to perform its actions.</p>
                  <p>And truly, I ſee the moſt learned Ariſtoteleans when they perceive the Tenet of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> cannot be otherwiſe explained or defended, they can find in their hearts to embrace this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. It is one and the ſame thing they ſay, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> names Privation, and which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he names the Form, whoſe abſence, after its manner, is Privation, viz. In a divers reſpect. <hi>Scaliger, Exercit.</hi> 6. <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. There is in the Seed the forming Soul, going before the Soul for which it prepartes that Houſe; or as <hi>Zabarella,</hi> in his B. <hi>de facult. anim. cap.</hi> 11. ſpeaks, the animated ſeed is a certain Matter cut off by the Animal it ſelf which ingenders, retaining an active power able to generate a like Animal. For the ſeed of a Man hath an implanted force in it, whereby (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaies, 2. <hi>Phyſ.</hi>) the Humane Nature is not as it were a Form, but as an Artificer, or immediate Agent. And therefore (in the former reſpect) it is an internal Principle of the thing to be formed; and although it do not inform that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound which yet is not; yet it informs the Seed ſo as to give it the name of a Mans ſeed, a Dogs ſeed, an Horſes ſeed, &amp;c. And therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> cals Privation the Form as it were 2 <hi>Phyſ. cap.</hi> 1. <hi>t.</hi> 15. in reſpect of the form conſidered after the latter manner, viz. of the Compound. Inaſmuch therefore as it diſpoſes the Matter, and is the Architect of the parts to be formed out of the ſeed, ſo far it is termed Privation. And it is in reality a ſubſtance, and it is only termed a <hi>Non Ers,</hi> or a Non-being, in reſpect of the Form which ſhal animate
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:35070:130"/>the parts generated out of the ſeed. For it hath not yet the Office of a form. So that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Generat. animal. cap.</hi> 1. is to be underſtood with a grain of Salt, where <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> tels us, that the Soul is potentially in the ſeed. For as the parts of the Body are not actually in the ſeed: ſo neither is the Soul in the Seed as a Form, ſo as to give Eſſence to the parts of the compound, which are to be framed out of the Seed. Mean while it is actually in the Seed, as a principle of acting, that the living thing may be generated, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly diſcourſes in the foreſaid place. To which purpoſe alſo <hi>Julius Caeſar Scaliger</hi> in <hi>Exercitat</hi> 6. <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. thus writes. <hi>Concerning this matter we are thus to think: That the Form is in the ſeed of a Dog, in the aptitude whereof it is ſaid to be; becauſe the Seed is able to give that Form which it hath in it ſelf. Now it is reduced out of that remote aptitude which is the firſt act, to a neer aptitude which is the ſecond act,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Form may be in the ſame Matter after ſuch a manner as to need no helps to enjoy its end for which the whol Compound is ordained. It muſt therefore be declared after what manner it is brought forth by preparation; in caſe the Form it ſelf be author of that preparation. For the Form does both alter the whol, and order the parts for its own accommodation. The Form therefore ſhould draw it ſelf forth. Therefore they ſaid not well; That when it ſhal attain the greateſt perfection of preparation, then alſo it ſhal arrive to the ſubſtantial Form. For the Form it ſelf exiſts before that: therefore it does not arrive to it, but to the act thereof, whereby it may afterward enjoy the uſe and benefit thereof.</hi> After which manner i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> any man wil explain Privation, I willingly ſhal allow thereof. Yet this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, That the vulgar Doctrine of Education of Forms cannot ſtand with this Opinion.</p>

                  <p>NOw as the Forms are the firſt Cauſe of al Actions; ſo in regard of their Forms there is a Conſent and Diſſent of al Natural Things,
<note place="margin">There is a Conſent &amp; Diſſent of Natural things.</note> and ſome things have a friendly apperite one to another, and unite themſelves; others are averſe one to another, and fly one from another. <hi>For things like do exceedingly covet <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion. For that which is not one is not at all. So, that which is ſeparated from its like ſeems alſo to defraud the ſame, and that it is defrauded thereby of the compleatneſs (as it were) of its Eſſence; for I do not ſay they are two fires, but one divided:</hi> As <hi>Scaliger</hi> writes, <hi>Exercit.</hi> 310 <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. Seeing therefore every thing requires its own Conſervation; it attains the ſame by ſhunning things contrary, by moving to things like, and by drawing like things unto it ſelf. Hence Fire uni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es to Fire, but flies from Water; and Water unites to Water, but flies Fire. Hence Water ſprinkled in the Air or on duſt gathers it ſelf into round drops like balls to defend it ſelf from the Earth and Air. Hence a ſmal flame is moſt ſwiftly drawn to a greater, or a little flame does move it ſelf to a greater. The ſame is done in the Air. Hence thoſe Bubbles which are made on the Water do move one to another, and ſo much the faſter by how much they are neerer. So (as <hi>Pliny</hi> writes, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 105.) <hi>Naphtha</hi> is of great kin to Fire, and the Fire leaps to it if it come neer the ſame. So they report <hi>Medea</hi> burnt het Rival, her Garland taking Fire as ſhe came to the Altar to Sacrifice. Hence we ſee that if Water be ſprinkled into boyling Oyl or Tallow, or melted Lead or Antimony, the fire flies from the water as an Enemy, raiſes a flame and mounts aloft; ſo that ſomtimes water poured into boyling Oyl or Tallow, hath been the occaſion of ſetting Houſes on fire. And here <hi>Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyinus Fracaſtorius</hi> is of a different mind, who in his Book <hi>de Sympath. &amp; Antipath. cap. 5.</hi> dentes that one thing is moved to another by reaſon of ſimilitude, ſo that it may be united hereto and preſerved; becauſe the part ſeparated can neither by knowledg, nor by Nature, be moved to its like part. And that it knows not, he thinks it a cleer caſe. But without Reaſon.
<note place="margin">A Natural Appetite, &amp; a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg.</note> For as there is a certain Natural Appetite which they commonly cal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Natural: ſo there is a certain natural knowledg diſtinct from ſenſe and underſtanding. For nothing can ſeek after any thing as pleaſing, or ſlie it as diſpleaſing, unleſs it have ſome natural knowledg of the gratefulneſs &amp; fitneſs of the one, and the ungratefulneſs &amp; unfitneſs of the other. For nothing is deſired that is not firſt known. By this kind of knowledg Plants do know ſuch Nutriment as is fit for them, deſire and draw the ſame to them; and what is unconvenient for them they let alone; and that which they have drawn, they turn ſome of it into Bark, other ſome into Fruit, other ſome into other parts. Of which <hi>Hippocrates, de Nat. humana, text.</hi> 31. <hi>Suco things as grow and are ſown, when they come into the Earth, every one draws that which in the Earth is moſt familiar thereto, as there is bitter, ſweet,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:35070:130"/>ſowr, and all kinds.</hi> So in the Criſis of Diſeaſes, by a Natural Knowledg Nature knows and expels a vitious humor, and retains the good and profitable. By this Natural Knowledg Nature many times ſeeks ſtrange and hidden waies to expel humors. And amongſt the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Nature of things <hi>Galen</hi> re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ckons this alſo from <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> 1. <hi>de facult. nat. cap.</hi> 12. That Nature performs al things artificially and juſtly, as being furniſhed with Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties whereby al the ſmal particles do draw convenient juyce to themſelves, and when it is drawn they make it grow and ſtick to every part, and at laſt aſſimilate the ſame; and what in the mean while they have not been able to vanquiſh, and that which wil receive no altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor become any waies like the thing which is to be nouriſhed; that they reject by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faculty, viz. the ſeparative. And in the ſame place, <hi>Lib. 3. cap.</hi> 13. he writes: That al the particles of the whol Body have a power to draw to themſelves that which is agreeable and friendly to them, and to force back that which is burdenſom and biting. And therefore <hi>Fracaſtorius</hi> labors in vain to ſhew how by a certain violence ſuch things as are ſeparated one from another may be again joyned together. Now although this Natural Conſent and Diſſent of things does ſpring primarily from their forms: yet becauſe the Forms do act by Qualities; ſome things alſo conſent or diſſent by manifeſt Qualities, as Water and Fire, and others by occult or ſecret Qualities, of which we ſhall ſpeak here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                  <p>And from this Conſent and Diſſent of things Natural a reaſon may be given of many things which happen in Chymiſtry and Phyſick, and every where in the world.
<note place="margin">Examples of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and Diſſent of things.</note> Salt things are mixed with ſalt, and diſſolved by ſalt things; Oyls mingled with Oyly, Fat, and Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous things. For examples ſake, <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> diſſolves Metals, yet can it not diſſolve Brimſtone: contrarywiſe, Brimſtone is diſſolved in Oyl which cannot diſſolve Metals. So Gums and Sulphureous fatty Tears of Plants are diſſolved by Oyl; but ſuch things as are of a warry ſubſtance are diſſolved by Wine and Water, not by Oyls. 'Tis a common Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice for a man that hath fouled his Hands with Pitch not to waſh them in Water, but in Oyl or Greaſe, which wil diſſolve the Pitch. And every where in the compoſtition of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments ſuch things occur, eſpecially in the making Plaiſters, which if the Apothecary be ignorant of, he wil loſe both his labor and materials.
<note place="margin">Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> Alſo precipitations ſo called do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford a rare document hereof; when Gold, Silver, Corals, Peatls, Crabs-Eyes, and ſuch like, are diſſolved and precipitated. To ſpeak only of Corals and Pearls; for examples ſake (for the ſame reaſon holds in al) theſe Bodies are diſſolved by the Salt of diſtilled Vinegar, or the like ſharp Liquor, whereunto that ſame Body in regard of affinity is ſo joyned and united by the moſt ſubtile Atomes, that it may be ſtrained through a brown paper. To this Liquor (containing in it the Body of Corals and Pearls) if you drop in Oyl of Tartar made by <hi>deliquium,</hi> or Oyl of Vitriol, the Salt of Solvent Liquor unites it ſelf to the Oyl of Tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar or Vitriol by reaſon of affinity, and leaves the diſſolved Body; which being ſo left unto it ſelf, deſcends to the bottom by its Natural heavineſs, which they cal precipitating. Alſo how great the force of Gunpouder is there is no man ignorant; and that proceeds only from the antipathy that is betwixt Brimſtone and Salt-peeter. From the ſame proceed Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, Thunders, and Thunder-bolts. For if in the Globe of the Earth Sulphureous, Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, and watry Vapors are at once raiſed aloft, in the lowermoſt Region (truly) of the Air, where it compaſſes us about, being diſperſed into very ſmal atomes, they fight not together: but when in the Clouds the fiery atomes or particles are joyned with fiery, the ſulphureous with ſulphureous, the watry with watry, at laſt reſuming Courage on both fides they fight furiouſly, and both fly from, and chaſe away their Enemy. Hence the Fire ſhunning the Water Lightens out of the Clouds. From this Fight rumblings and Thunder-cracks are raiſed, and that ſame Fiery and Sulphureous Spirit breaking out of the Clouds melts, burns, or throws down whatever it meets with. Alſo there is a vulgar example hereof in Quick-lime, upon which if Water be poured, the fiery atomes which lay hid therein flying the water as their Enemy do break forth. Whereupon being collected they have raiſed ſo great heat, that they have been known to ſet on fire ſome wood that was at hand. Alſo if you put Spirit of Nitre to Butter of Antimony, or Oyl of Vitriol to the filings of Steel or Iron, there ariſes a boyling and a noiſe, yea, and a flame too. Where nevertheleſs it is to be noted, That it is credible that this ſame boyling is not cauſed only by the fight of Contraries, but alſo by the ſudden motion of like parts to like. Alſo from this Conſent and Diſſent of Natural things many Queſtions in Phyſick may be anſwered,
<note place="margin">The cure of perſons burnt, and ſuch as are frozen with cold.</note> and Controverſies compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. That Burns are cured by burning things, viz. by holding ones burnt hand againſt the fire, or by ſmearing the burned parts with Linſeed Oyl, or an Oyntment made of Onions; and parts nummed with cold, by rubbing them with Snow, or dipping them in cold water;
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:35070:131"/>and that Apples or Eggs being frozen, are cured by putting them in cold Water: all theſe effects happen becauſe hot things draw hot things to themſelves, and cold things draw cold things.

Howbeit the taſt and its aptneſs to burn do ſo manifeſtly convince it to be hot, that I wonder any man can doubt thereof. The on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing which perſwaded others that it was cold, is becauſe it does cool. But this it does, not of it ſelf, but by accident, viz. Whiles it draws the fiery and ſulphureous atomes, out of the Body unto it ſelf, by reaſon of ſimilitude: which the flowers and water of Elder do in the Roſe or fiery Inflammation ſo called, as alſo Oyl mixed with Lye.</p>

With the Peripateticks indeed it is out of queſtion, that there are in this ſublunary World no ſimple Bodies but the Elements; and that of them al others are compounded. Howbeit, many have doubted hereof, and that not without cauſe. <hi>Johan. Franciſc. Picus Mirandulanus,</hi> in his Book of Elements, chap. 3. writes: <hi>If there be any that will not content themſelves with the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Authority of the Philoſophers, and will maintain that there are yet ſome other Elements mixed with thoſe vulgarly known, which by a ſecret power of Nature concur to the conſtitution of ſublunary things, they can hardly be ſubſtantially refuted.</hi> And <hi>Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Schegkius,</hi> in his Book of the Power and Efficacy of Heat, chap. 4. writes, That every Body is either an Element, or compounded of Elements, or hath ſome proportion and ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude with the Bodies Coeleſtial. And that he had out of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who in 2. <hi>de Generat. Animal. cap.</hi> 3. writes, That the heat in living things is neither fire, not hath its Original from fire, but is of analogy to the Heavenly Matter. But what the Body is, and whence it had its Original, cannot be explained without the Creation of the World. But from the Creation of the World all theſe things are clear. For God did not at firſt command the Elements to fight together, to make up mixt Bodies, of which afterwards Plants and living things were to be made; but as he gave to Plants and Animals their Forms and Souls, ſo he gave unto each of them their peculiar Bodies. Which although (for I wil not now diſpute that point) they may be conſtituted of the Elements as to their matter: yet that there ſhould be nothing in them but Elements, and that the forms of theſe Bodies are Elementary, and that the Souls of Living Creatures are received in a Body ſimply conſtituted of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and that ſo the Elements conſidered either as ſimples, or as mixt Bodies, ſhould be the immediate ſubject of Souls, there is no firm demonſtration to prove; not is it yet proved, That that which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaies holds proportion to the Element of the Stars is a meer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound of the four Elements ſo called. For ſince more noble Forms do require a more noble Matter (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> alſo teaches) the Creator gave to every Form a convenient Body, each of which receives its nobility and activity from the Form, which (as <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citat.</hi> 307. <hi>Sect.</hi> 20.) is a fift Nature, far differing from the four Elements. And in very deed, that Spirit which is inbred in Animals and Plants is a wonderful thing, which firſt is in a ſmal quantity of feed, and afterwards by means of the Blood flowing in at the firſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the yong one, and then by the Aliments taken in it is encreaſed to a great bulk, and goes al over the whol body of an huge Animal, and warms and enlivens the ſame ſo long as the Creature lives. And although this Spirit be of its own Nature hot, yes, and heat it ſelf, though the admixture of other things with it makes that it is not diſcerned, yet is it really in them; and it may be ſeparated from them, as appears in Spirits made out of Plants. Where this is alſo to be noted, That as nothing is nouriſhed but what hath life, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> teaches, 2. <hi>de animal cap.</hi> 4. <hi>text.</hi> 46. ſo nothing can properly nouriſh, unleſs is be a part, fruit, or effect of a thing animated or endued with a Soul; and therefore in al aliments there ought to be ſome of that Spirit which they vulgarly cal <hi>Calidum innanem,</hi> or inbred heat; and
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:35070:131"/>their food does not only reſtore the moiſture, but the heat alſo.</p>
                  <p>Nor do other Bodies which ſeem to be only mixed and not animated ariſe from the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual fight of the Elements. It is a point of ſmal diſcretion to beleeve that Wine, Oyl, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, Sugar, do ariſe from the mutual fight of the Elements. The truth is, God did not create thoſe things at the Beginning. For there is no Wine before Vintage, nor Oyl til the Olives are gathered, bruiſed, and preſſed; nor Honey before the Bees make it, nor Milk before living Creatures that bring forth live yong ones become with yong. But God created ſuch things in their Principles, that is to ſay, he gave a power to the Vine to make ſuch a Liquor as Wine out of the nutriment it draws out of the Earth, the Olive tree ſuch a juyce as the Oyl, a Reed to breed ſuch a juyce as we cal Sugar; and to the Bees he gave power to gather juyce out of Flowers, and thereof to make Honey; to the Dugs a faculty to make Milk.</p>
                  <p>And here the Chymiſts bring in their Principles, concerning which I have ſpoken largely in my Treatiſe of the Conſent and Diſſent of the Chymiſts with the Galeniſts and Ariſtote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans. That I may ſay a little of them in this place; firſt of al, thoſe who do not ſimply allow them as Elements, do grant them to be the firſt mixt bodies. About which I wil contend with no man, if I may but obtain thus much, that in ſuch a Sence they may be called Principles, becauſe in the reſolution or ſeparation of mixt bodies Art can hardly proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further, yea, and perhaps Nature goes no further, which when ſhe makes a mixt body does not immediately conſtitute the ſame of the laſt Principles, but rather of theſe firſt mixt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: whereof I ſhal ſpeak more hereafter in my Third Diſcourſe concerning Mixture. And this is moſt of al manifeſt in the Nouriſhment of Living Creatures. For neither is the <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> made immediately of the Elements, but of Bread, Fleſh, Fiſh, &amp;c. Nor is Blood made of the Elements immediately, but of Chyle, as we ſhal ſhew more at large when we come to ſpeak of Mixture.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, this alſo is worthy our Conſideration, Whether thoſe firſt mixt bodies do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of the Elements only? or whether they received from God in the firſt Creation a Form different from the Forms of the Elements, ſince God created not the firſt matter only, but alſo the ſecond, and gave every Form its proper matter and ſubject, by which they preſerve themſelves, and remain entire in the ſundry Viciſſitudes of Generations, and being variouſly mixt do afford matter to other natural things. Truly as the Expoſitors of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> are too long in their Diſputations of <hi>Materia prima</hi> or the firſt matter, ſo are they over-ſparing in the Conſideration of the ſecond Matter, whereas every Form does nevertheleſs require its peculiar matter or ſubject. For neither can every body be the proper matter and ſubject of every form, eſpecially of Souls, but in living Creatures it muſt be ſo diſpoſed of neceſſity as that it have an immediate aptitude to receive a Soul, and to be converted into the ſubſtance of a living body, and to be nouriſhed by the nutritive faculty. Which diſpoſition proceeds from the peculiar Forms. Now that there are in Plants and in living Creatures forms di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the Soul, which belong to the proper Conſtitution of the Subject of Souls, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſufficiently manifeſted by the wonderful operations of dead Plants, and the parts of dead Creatures in Phyſick. For ſince every action flows primarily from the form, and theſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are more noble than that they can proceed from the forms of the Elements,
<note place="margin">There are Forms ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-added to the forms of mixt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</note> either ſimple or mixed; of neceſſity there are other forms beſides the forms of the Elements, from which theſe actions proceed; and I ſee no cauſe why I may not cal them with <hi>Scaliger,</hi> a fift Eſſence, and the Body wherein they are, with <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Schegkius,</hi> a thing anſwering to the Element of the Stars; And ſome of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Interpreters (among whom <hi>Zimara</hi> eſpecially) do hold, That not only Souls are ſuper-added to the Forms of the Elements, but alſo that the form of miſtion is a fift form really diſtinct from the forms of the four Elements, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added to them.</p>
                  <p>Hence, Whereas they ſay, That ſome bodies are ſimple, others compound, and that ſome are more, others leſs compound; that does not come to paſs by reaſon of the firſt matter and Elements, but in reſpect of the Forms. For ſince al mixt Bodies conſiſt of the four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in that reſpect one is not more compound than another. But becauſe ſome forms do preſuppoſe other ſome, and cannot perform their operations ſave in a ſubject after a certain manner diſpoſed by other forms: ſuch Bodies which contain divers forms beſides the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are termed Compounds, ſuch as are the Bodies of al living things. Hence that form is moſt perfect which hath moſt other forms under its Command.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince to Know is to underſtand a thing by its Cauſe, we muſt labor with all our might, that in the things of Nature alſo we may render the true and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Cauſes of all operations and effects. That there are indeed in nature four Elements, and that they work by their firſt qualities (ſo called) which are obvious to the Senſe is a thing out of Queſtion. But there are very many Effects in Nature which can no waies be referred to thoſe Qualities. And therefore the moſt acute <hi>Julius Caeſar Scaliger</hi> in <hi>Exercit.</hi> 218. <hi>ſect.</hi> 8. ingenuouſly and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly writes, that to reduce al Effects in nature to the firſt qualities is extream Impudence. And thoſe who endeavor to do ſo, it happens to them as <hi>Galen</hi> writes of <hi>Epicurus</hi> and <hi>Aſclepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades,</hi> in <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de natural. facultat. cap.</hi> 14. that either they alleadg fooliſh and ridiculous reaſons, or deny thoſe things which are confirmed even by Experience, and as <hi>Thomas E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſtus de occultis medica. proprietat.</hi> writes, they get nothing but to be derided by all that are ſtudious of the truth and knowing in the things of Nature. And therefore <hi>Galen Lib.</hi> 11. <hi>de ſimp. med. facultat.</hi> when he treats of the vertue of the aſhes of River Crabs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the biting of mad Dogs, acknowledges their ſaid faculty proceeds altogether from their whol ſubſtance, and reprehends his Maſter <hi>Pelops</hi> becauſe he boaſted very ambitiouſly, that he knew the Cauſes of all ſuch things; and promiſes that he would at one time or another write a Book concerning ſuch things as act by the propriety of their whol ſubſtance. And if there were nothing elſe to perſwade us how vainly and raſhly many have endeavored to reduce all things to the firſt qualitites, Poyſons at leaſt and their remedies might teach us ſo much, as the ſame <hi>Scaliger</hi> tels us in the place fore-alleadged. I for my part do freely and boldly pronounce, that there is hardly any more pernicious opinion, and which hath more wearied even the beſt wits and worn them out with vain and fruitleſs labor, than that of thoſe men who endeavor to aſſign cauſes of all things which happen in nature from the four Elements and natural Qualities. For whether you conſider them as ſimples, or however mixed and remixed, and however you may ſuppoſe their Qualities to be tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, nothing can proceed from them but what is Elementary. And it is al one whether more or fewer come to ſup without money, for they muſt all faſt. But this error hath been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereto ſufficiently common, nor hath it kept it ſelf within the bounds of natural Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, but hath alſo crept into Phyſick, whiles many men have vainly endeavored to fetch the differences of all Diſeaſes, their Cauſes and Symptoms, with the virtues of medicaments, from the firſt Qualities.</p>
                  <p>But in very deed, certain moſt experienced Phyſitians have long ſince acknowledged this Error and warned others thereof,
<note place="margin">Fernelius <hi>defends occult Qualities.</hi>
                     </note> amongſt the reſt <hi>Johannes Fernelius,</hi> a moſt excellent Phyſitian, who <hi>in two Books de Abditis rerum Cauſis,</hi> hath moſt learnedly demonſtrated, that many things are, and are performed in Phyſick, whoſe cauſes 'tis vain to draw from the temper of the firſt Qualities. For which excellent pains nevertheleſs of his he hath gained nothing from ſome but reproach and back-biting. And no wonder; for the world is gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by opinions: and many think it not very honorable, yea and a foul diſgrace too, to
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:35070:132"/>lay down the Errors they have unwarily drunk in, and to admit and acknowledg the truth, though it dazle their Eyes with its moſt cleer brightneſs; and therefore whatever they are ignorant of they eſteem as new and falſe. Mean while all more learned Philoſophers and Phyſitians have undertook to defend the truth, and have conſtantly taught, that the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of many things in natural Philoſophy and Phyſick do depend upon hidden Qualities, and that we are glad oftentimes to fly to the ſaving Sanctuary (as <hi>Scaliger Exercit.</hi> 218. <hi>ſect.</hi> 8. names it) of an occult Propriety: which whiles it is called ignorance by ſome,
<note place="margin">Whether occult Qualities be the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. The occult qualities cauſe ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> they rather accuſe the weakneſs of our underſtandings to dive into the ſecrets of Nature, then blame theſe hidden Qualities. For if the true Original of theſe qualities be ſought into, (whereof few have taken care) the knowledg thereof wil produce as certain ſcience as that of the firſt Qualities. For the natural Philoſopher knows no more of Heat, but that it Heats, and that it flows from and depends upon the form of Fire: which form is to man as unknown as thoſe forms from whence the hidden qualities ariſe. For as <hi>Scaliger Exercit.</hi> 307. <hi>ſect.</hi> 29. ſaies, The Form is a divine thing, the perfect knowledg whereof is hidden from us, and therefore to ſearch further is the part of an unquiet and over-buſie mind. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe who traduce theſe Qualities, by calling them the Sanctuary of Ignorance are long ſince worthily refuted by <hi>Avicenna, Lib. de virib. Cordis, tract.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. when he thus writes: As he that knows fire warms by reaſon of the heat therein, truly knows and is not Ignorant: ſo he that knows the Load-ſtone draws Iron becauſe it hath a virtue in it whoſe nature is to draw Iron, without doubt is knowing, and not Ignorant. <hi>And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards:</hi> The Ignorance of the Cauſes of this Virtue in the Load-ſtone is no whit ſtranger than the Ignorance of the Cauſes diſpoſing things be to red or yellow, or the Body to the Soul. But admiration ceaſes in things we are uſed to, and our mind neglects to enquire concerning them. But that which happens ſeldom ſtirs us up to admiration, and moves us to enquire and contemplate the cauſes thereof. <hi>And a little after:</hi> If that Fire were a thing hard to come by, and brought from far Countries, People would more admire the properties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of than the properties of other Bodies, and more enquire into the Cauſes of its proprieties than into the Cauſes of other Proprieties, becauſe its proprieties are very wonderful. For the preſence thereof brings the ſight from aptitude to act,
<note place="margin">The won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of Fire.</note> and it will not ſuffer it ſelf to be touched; alſo it mounts upwards, and makes ſuch things as it can maſter to aſcend with it, and of a ſmal quantity thereof in the ſpace of an hour a great quantity is bred; and it corrupts every thing i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> meets with, and changes it into its own ſubſtance; nor is it leſſened though you take ſome from it. And theſe things are in truth more wonderful than the drawing of Iron by the Load-ſtone, or than other Proprieties. But becauſe theſe are uſual, and day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeen, we ceaſe to admire them, nor are careful to enquire into their Cauſes. But the action of the Loadſtone, becauſe it is rare and unuſual, induces to admiration, and provokes men to enquire after its cauſes. And indeed if we enquire into the original of theſe hidden qualities, there may be had of them as certain knowledg as of thoſe that are manifeſt. For in this darkneſs of humane underſtanding the form of the Fire is to us as unknown as that of the Loadſtone, and as the Poet ſings.

                  <p>Now theſe Qualities are called Occult, Hidden, Abſtruſe,
<note place="margin">the names of occult Qualities and what they are.</note> to difference them from the manifeſt qualities which are diſcernable by the external Senſes, eſpecially the Feeling; whereas contrariwiſe theſe are not perceivable by the Senſe, although their operations are. So we ſee the attraction which is made by the Load ſtone; but we perceive not the qualities which cauſeth that motion of the Iron. So we perceive with out ſenſes the evacuation cauſed by purgative medicaments; but we do not perceive that quality by which the purging medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments do work that effect. After the ſame manner, we perceive with our Senſes the ſymptoms which Poyſons do ſtir up in our Bodies; but the qualities whereby they cauſe the ſaid ſymptoms we perceive not by the ſenſe. By our Senſes (for example ſake) we perceive Heat in the Fire, by means whereof it heats: but it is not ſo in thoſe operations which are performed by occult qualities. We perceive the Actions but not the qualities whereby they are affected. Hence theſe qualities are termed hidden and ſpecifical proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, faculties proper to ſubſtance; and ſuch Agents are by <hi>Galen</hi> called things acted by their whol ſubſtance, or by a propriety and familiarity of their whol ſubſtance, 6. <hi>Epidem.

                     <hi>Scaliger,</hi> If nothing elſe could perſwade how vainly and raſhly many endeavor to reduce al effects to the firſt qualities; at leaſt Poyſons and their Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies might convince us. And a thouſand ſuch actions are every where met with in the courſe of Nature. Since therefore ſuch actions are of a quite different kind from the actions of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Qualities, and ſurpaſs their faculties, we do therefore juſtly diſtinguiſh theſe Qualities from thoſe which are manifeſt to the Senſe, and term them occult. <hi>Galen</hi> knew this, who writes in his 6. <hi>Epidemic. Com.</hi> 6. <hi>text.</hi> 5. and 3. <hi>de temperament. cap.</hi> 4. expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that poyſons do not at al act after the ſelf-ſame manner as fire and water, but by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety of their whol Nature.

                  <p>Again,
<note place="margin">Alſo the manner of acting is different.</note> The Elements have a much different manner of acting from that of thoſe things which work by occult Qualities. For the Elements (to exerciſe their Faculties) require a ſufficient bulk of Body, nor can they exerciſe their forces in a very ſmal quantity. For though fire be extreamly hot, and Snow extreamly cold; yet as <hi>Galen</hi> wel writes in his 1. <hi>de Temperamentis, cap.</hi> 4. a very ſmal quantity of either of theſe works no effect in our Bodies; yea, bodies ſo qualified do not kil a man though taken in a good quantity, whether hot of cold; as Snow, Pepper, cold Water. Again, they do not work ſuch ſudden muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Body. But ſome Poyſons kil a man in the ſmalleſt quantity imaginable, or ſtir up moſt grievous Symptomes, and that in a moment. Of which <hi>Galen, Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, cap.</hi> 16. thus writes, <hi>The ſmalleſt portion of a deadly poyſon being entred into a man or other Creature, does change it totally in a moment of time, and qualifie the ſame with a diſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And <hi>Jul. Caeſ.

                  <p>By which Reaſons moſt learned men being moved,
<note place="margin">Occult qualities known &amp; aſſerted by learned Men.</note> have acknowledged and taught, that there are very many Qualities in Nature, beſides the Elementary. <hi>Galen</hi> (as we ſaid before in the beginning of our firſt chapter of this Diſcourſe) in his 11. <hi>de ſimpl med. facult. cap.</hi> 14. where he treats of the vertue of the Aſhes of River Crabs againſt the biting of a mad Dog, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends his Maſter <hi>Pelops</hi> that he vain-gloriouſly boaſted that he knew the cauſes of al ſuch
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:35070:133"/>things: and in his firſt <hi>de nat. facult. cap.</hi> 14. concerning <hi>Epicurus</hi> and <hi>Aſclepiades</hi> he writes, That thoſe who endeavor to bring manifeſt cauſes for al Diſeaſes, it commonly fals out, that either they bring fooliſh and ridiculous reaſons, or deny thoſe things which even experience it ſelf confirms. And in the third B. of the faculties of ſimple Medicaments, chap. 3. he writes; And truly it is by us in other Treatiſes demonſtrated, that there are in all things certain Agreements and Repugnancies of Qualities, and that which is familiar is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily aſſimilated, but that which is contrary kils both Plants and Animals; alſo that theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarities proceed from the propriety of the whol ſubſtance. And in B. 5. <hi>de ſimpl. med. facult. cap.</hi> 2. we have ſhewed (ſaies he) that Medicaments have a faculty to alter, either by one quality, viz. By heating or cooling, moiſtening or drying, or by ſome of the ſaid qualities joyned together, or by their whol ſubſtance; as moſt deadly poyſons, many An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidotes or amulets, and al Purgers. Which alſo he repeats in the ſame Book, chap. 17, 18, 19, 23. The ſame he teaches in the 6. 8. &amp; 9. <hi>de ſimp. med. fac.</hi> the 1. <hi>de compoſ. med. ſecundum genera, cap.</hi> 16. the 8. <hi>de compoſ. med. ſecundum loca, cap.</hi> 8. the 13. <hi>de Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do medendi, cap.</hi> 6. <hi>Alexander Aphrodiſaeus</hi> writes in his Proceme to the Problems, that there are infinite things in Nature, which can be known only by experience, and are therefore by Phyſitians termed Hidden Properties; and he reproves thoſe who endeavor to render the Cauſes of ſuch things from the qualities of the Elements, and that they ſcurvily botch up cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſolutions which are altogether unprofitable and improbable: whom <hi>Meſues</hi> and other Arabians do follow. But in the Age laſt paſt, <hi>Johannes Fernelius</hi> that moſt learned Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian does largely and learnedly maintain theſe Qualities in his 2. Books <hi>de Abditis Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum cauſis;</hi> who in the Preface to his ſecond Book thus writes. Many indeed laugh at the Atomes of <hi>Democritus;</hi> but <hi>Democritus</hi> if he were to riſe from the dead would much more (after his manner) laugh at theſe Elements we talk of, inaſmuch as ſome endeavor to draw the cauſes of al things in Nature from them. The moſt acute <hi>Jul. Caeſar Scaliger,</hi> in his 218. <hi>Exercit. Sect.</hi> 8. writes, That it is a point of extream Impudence to refer al things to manifeſt Qualities; and in <hi>Exercit.</hi> 101. <hi>Sect.</hi> 14. thus he beſpeaks <hi>Cardan:</hi> What evil Alexandrean ſpirit hath ſo befotted thee that thou ſhouldeſt pitifully beleeve it poſſible that the Load-ſtone ſhould draw Iron to it only by the mixture of the Elements? And in his firſt Book of Plants, treating of Taſts, he hath this paſſage: But if any man ſhal ſay, That Taſt is made by a conſpiration of the four firſt Qualities, let him tel me, Whether in any Element as an Element there is any Taſt? There is truly none at al. But as neither life proceeds from the Elements, nor laughter, nor ſenſe, nor underſtanding, nor voluntary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but from other forms beſides the Elementary; even ſo does Taſt alſo. And though there were no other thing to perſwade us that there are other occult Qualities beſides the Elementary; we might be ſatisfied only by the conſideration of Poyſons. The ſame <hi>Scaliger</hi> in <hi>Exercit.</hi> 218. <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. ſaies: Many of them have Proprieties different from the Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Qualities, which are concealed from temperate minds, and delude the curious. And <hi>Thomas Eraſtus</hi> in his 4. chap. of the Hidden properties of Medicaments (which place I alleadged in the firſt Chapter) ſaies, That they who would reduce al effects to manifeſt Qualities do gain nothing, but to be juſtly derided by al that are ſtudious of the Truth, and skilful in the things of Nature. Alſo <hi>Johan. Franciſc. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lmus</hi> hath defended, explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and by many examples proved the ſaid occult Qualities, in <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de occultis in re me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic. proprietat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which <hi>Galen</hi> ſaies happened to them that reduced al things to firſt Qualities, that either they brought fooliſh and ridiculous Reaſons, or denied ſuch things as were evident, that alſo happened to <hi>Sanctorius,</hi> who in his <hi>Lib.</hi> 8. <hi>Methodi Vitand. in Medicin. Error.</hi> endeavors to reduce hidden and occult properties to manifeſt qualities: Whoſe Diſcourſe of that Subject I think ſit briefly to propound and examine.</p>
                  <p>But at firſt, in <hi>cap.</hi> 3. by way of a Ground-work he premiſes that Queſtion,
<note place="margin">Sancto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius his Diſcourſe of Hidden Qualities examined.</note> Whether the Faculties of the Soul do eſſentially differ from the ſubſtance of the Soul? or Whether they are in the ſame predicament therewith, viz. in the Predicament of ſubſtance; and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Fountain of that error concerning occult qualities to be, that thoſe who hold there are qualities of the whol ſubſtance, do conceive that they belong to the predicament of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. For ſuppoſe indeed that ſome there were who conceived the Faculties of the Soul differed not from the Eſſence thereof; yet they held an Error. And herein we willingly aſſent to <hi>Sanctorius</hi> when he holds the powers of the Soul are not ſubſtances; but that they differ from ſubſtances and are qualities. But if ſuch things are ſomtimes by Authors attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to Faculties which are proper to ſubſtances, there is an equivocation in the word <hi>Potentia,</hi> power or Faculty, which ſomtimes (and that properly) is taken for a quality, but
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:35070:134"/>ſomtimes (though improperly) for a ſubſtance, having a power or faculty to act. And ſuch ſubſtances are not only Souls, but alſo other forms, as that of the Load-ſtone. For all forms are ſubſtances which have their powers of exerciſing certain actions, all which they do not perform by manifeſt, but ſome by Hidden Qualities. He labors therefore in vain chap. 6.
<note place="margin">Sancto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius <hi>his arguments examined.</hi>
                     </note> while both by Authorities out of <hi>Galen,</hi> by reaſons and experiments, he endeavors to prove, That hidden Qualities proceed not from the ſubſtance, but from the manifeſt Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. For in the firſt place, that which he brings out of <hi>Galen,</hi> 12. <hi>Method. Medend,</hi> and other places, that occult qualities have their contraries, but ſubſtances have no contrary, is of no moment: for the occult Qualities are not ſubſtances, but qualities flowing from their forms. And if there be any other ſuch arguments, they touch nor our Opinion, but that of <hi>Fernelius,</hi> who holds Diſeaſes of the Form. Moreover, that which he brings out of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, Lib. de Conſtit.

                     </gap>ing unutterable proprieties from ſundry alterations, all that we grant. But if on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the firſt qualities be mixed, no occult qualities can ariſe from thence, but only a tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the firſt qualities; though the degree of the temper or mixture cannot alwaies be ſufficiently explained. So, when he ſaies, that of bitterneſs, ſweetneſs, harſhneſs, and acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony mingled there ariſes a quality, which becauſe it cannot be expreſſed by one name, may be termed ineffable or unucterable, al that we grant; but yet no occult quality, ſuch as is in the Load-ſtone, Poyſons, and ſuch like, does thence ariſe, but only a taſt, being only a manifeſt quality perceivable by the Tongue. Of the ſame moment is that which he allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as an experiment, that our of divers colors mixed peculiar colors ariſe. For whatever colors are mixed, nothing ariſes therefrom but color; but no occult Quality. And although of an hundred other altered qualities the determinate degree cannot be known: yet the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of drawing Iron which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> in the Load-ſtone cannot be made thereof as he falſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives. Out of the firſt Qualities only temperaments of tangible Qualities are made, though the determinate degree is not alwaies known; out of colors colors, out of Taſts Taſts are made. But never out of the firſt qualities, or taſts, or colors, can be made the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of drawing Iron, or of purging, or of ſtupifying like Opium, or ſuch as is in the Venom of the Peſtilence. From al which it is manifeſt that <hi>Sanctorius</hi> hath not rightly formed the ſtate of the Queſtion, but dallied with the equivocation of the words Ineffable and Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Quality, and was ignorant what that Occult Quality meant which is intended in the Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>But whereas in the ſeventh chap. he labors to find out the differences of Occult Qualities,
<note place="margin">Of the differences Occult dities.</note> therein he does wel in that he labors to fetch them from the Subject; ſince the condition of al qualities depends upon the firſt Subjects. But when he endeavors to deduce them from the firſt manifeſt Qualities, and ſecond, as Heat, Cold, Moiſture, Drineſs, Rarity, Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fity, he makes himſelf a laughing ſtock. For whereas in the firſt place he conceives the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſubjects whereby the Qualities may be defined may be taken from a ſubſtance conſidered as corporeal; he is exceedingly out. For from a Subſtance as Corporeal nothing proceeds but quantity and dimenſions. But on Bodies not conſidered as Bodies, but as furniſhed with certain Forms, the occult qualities and all others depend. Moreover, whereas he makes the Principle of al Paſſion to be Denſity and Rarity, and deduces the qualities both firſt and ſecond, hot, cold, moiſt, dry, hard, ſoft, ſtiff, crumbly, tough, ſmooth, thick, thin, from Rarity and Denſity, that therein he is in an error is ſo clear that it needs no proof. And let it be granted (truly) that thoſe Qualities proceed from Denſity and Rarity: yet all theſe qualities are not occult, concerning which our queſtion is, but tangible qualities. And that is yet more abſurd, that he endeavors to bring al from Scituation, and ſaies that Scitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation is the general kind of al: For from the Scituation of the parts of a Body proceeds Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Denſity, and from Rarity and Denſity hot and cold, moiſt and dry, alſo hard and ſoft, with the paſſions, and paſſive qualities.</p>
                  <p>And he becomes perfectly ridiculous when he writes chap. 10.
<note place="margin">Of the Antipathy betwixt a Man and a Cat.</note> That he ſaw in <hi>Hungaria</hi> an Italian Gentleman, who when he was near a Cat (though he ſaw it not) he preſently ſwooned, and unleſs the Cat had been driven away would have been choaked; and he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the cauſe hereof was Compactneſs and ſtraitneſs. For that the Gentleman was narrow cheſted, and apt to a Tiſſick, and in the Cat there were three deſtructive things for thoſe in the Tiſſick, viz. Its Brain, Breath, and Hair. Therefore he conceives it is no marvel if of theſe a new ſtopping quality was bred which might by the exhalation of the Cat be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a man, and by condenſing choak him. But one abſurdity being granted, a thouſand follow. For I my ſelf (and many others) have known ſuch as could not endure the Preſence of a Cat, yet are they not troubled with the Tiſſick. Moreover, if the deſtructive Faculty be
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:35070:134"/>in the Brain, Breath, and Hairs, it is not Denſity. Thirdly, If Cats do this by their thickning breath, why do Cars ſhut up in a Cheſt work the ſame effect? Fourthly, Thoſe that are troubled in this kind do not complain of the <hi>Aſthma</hi> and ſhortneſs of breath, but only of fainting fits.</p>
                  <p>But the beſt thing in this Diſcourſe of his is that which he hath in chap. 10.
<note place="margin">That there are Occult Qualities which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe not from the firſt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments.</note> where being convinced by the Truth it ſelf, he proves by many reaſons and experiments, that there are Hidden qualities which do not ariſe from the firſt qualities, whereof I ſhal ad only ſome, viz. Thoſe which directly prove that occult qualities do not flow from the firſt qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Experiment is of the Load-ſtone, which is notoriouſly known to draw Iron, which Faculty nevertheleſs cannot be reduced to any firſt quality.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If <hi>Doronicum</hi> did kill Dogs by vertue of Heat or Cold, it could not cure Men.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If Scorpions did kil by Heat, the drinking of pure unmixt Wine would not cure their poyſon.</p>
                  <p>If a dram of <hi>Opium</hi> kils by its coldneſs, why wil not an ounce of Ice (which is colder) do as much?</p>
                  <p>But the reſt of the Experiments which he brings do not prove that occult qualities flow not from the firſt; yet againſt thoſe who endeavor to derive al qualities from the firſt, they prove there are qualities which flow not from the firſt. For ſince alteration and the action proceeding from the firſt qualities is not effected in a moment, but gradually and in time; and that there are many mutations of qualities which happen in a moment, thence it appears that there are qualities which are not made by mutation of the firſt qualities. For if a red Glaſs be put before a blue Glaſs there ariſes therefrom in a moment a Violet color; if a blue Glaſs be put upon a yellowiſh Glaſs, there ariſes therefrom a green color; Water wherein Galls have boyled is clear, but if Water be poured thereinto wherein Vitriol hath been boyled, which is alſo clear, there ariſes a black color in a moment; and there are many ſuch mixtures which produce a new quality in a moment.</p>
                  <p>Finally, Whereas in cap. 11. he writes,
<note place="margin">All things are not vain which are reported of Occult Qualities.</note> That the maintainers of occult qualities have been too credulous to beleeve the moſt vain reports; I confeſs indeed that many fabulous and ſuperſtitious tales go up and down; but in the mean time, al things are not fabulous which are ſpoken of the effects of occult qualities. Doubtleſs thoſe reports of the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones Faculty to draw Iron, of the ſtupefactive faculty of Opium, of the Faculties of Poyſons and Antidores, of the Antipathy betwixt ſome people and Cats, are al moſt true, and any one may dayly experiment the ſame. And whereas he accounts for fabulous al that is ſaid of ſundry things hung about the Neck, or tied to the Body, he does it without cauſe; ſince thoſe things which are reported of Peony Root, the Elks Claw, the Nephritick Stone, and ſuch like things, are known by Experience to be really true. So alſo, thoſe things which are written of the Echeneis he can by no other reaſon confute ſave that it cannot produce ſuch an effect by hearing, or cooling, or rarefying, or rendring compact, or the like qualities. Others there are who account the Natration concerning the Echeneis to be fabulous; but <hi>Pliny, Lib.</hi> 32 <hi>cap.</hi> 1. confirms it by Hiſtories, thus writing:
<note place="margin">A Story of the Echeneis, Remora, or Stop fiſh</note> 
                     <hi>The Fiſh Echeneis or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mora, held the Praetorian Ship of</hi> Antony <hi>in the Actian Sea.</hi> And a little after he ſaies: <hi>It ſtopped alſo in our Memory the Ship or Galley of Prince</hi> Caius <hi>as he was ſailing from</hi> Aſtura <hi>to</hi> Antium. <hi>Nor was there long wondring at that ſtay, for preſently the cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing known, when of the whol Fleet that Galley only did not ſtir, ſome leapt out into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſeek the cauſe, and they found the ſaid Fiſh ſticking to the Rudder, and ſhewed it to</hi> Caius, <hi>who ſtormed that ſo ſmal a thing ſhould ſtop his courſe, and fruſtrate the endeavors of four hundred Rowers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore <hi>Franciſcus Valleſius, Controverſ. Med. &amp; Philoſ. Lib.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. ſaies,
<note place="margin">Tis ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to deny a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect becauſ the cauſeis unknown.</note> That it is a ridiculous thing to deny that which is manifeſt by Experience, becauſe we cannot tel the reaſon thereof. As if it were impoſſible any thing might happen in Nature of whoſe cauſe we are ignorant. We are ignorant of moſt things. And therefore they that would in Natural Philoſophy find out the Truth, and not fal into wild and ſophiſtical Opinions, they muſt begin with things known to the Senſe, and ſo proceed to the Cauſes, and having found them rejoyce in the Works of Nature; and not finding them, confeſs their own ignorance; but by no means deny things that are manifeſt. For it is leſs ſhameful having found out the effect to be ignorant of the Cauſe, which is frequently hid from the moſt expert Philoſophers, than together with the cauſe to be ignorant of the effect, which when you deny, the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple wil laugh at you, and prove it by experience.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>NOw to find out the Original of Occult Qualities is a very hard thing, nor are all men of the ſame Opinion concerning their Riſe. For in the firſt place, ſome there are who being moved with the evidence of the thing it ſelf, dare not deny occult Qualities: but when they come to ſearch out their Original, they fal back to the Elements and their Qualities, and endeavor vainly to derive the occult Qualities from their mixture and temperament: and conceive the hidden proprieties of things do proceed from a peculiar temper of the firſt Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, which therefore they term <hi>Idioſyncraſia.</hi> It is not (truly) ſufficiently apparent what <hi>Galen</hi> thought in this point, ſince that Book which in <hi>Lib.</hi> 11. <hi>de ſimp. med. fac.</hi> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to write of things which operate by their whol ſubſtance, and which he cites in the 6. <hi>Epidem. comm.</hi> 6. <hi>text.</hi> 5. is loſt through the injury of time; yet he ſeems to encline to this Opinion, and to reſt much in the firſt Qualities. For in the 1. <hi>de Element. cap.</hi> 7. he writes, That cur Bodies are altered only by being heated, cooled, dried, moiſtened; for that theſe Qualities only do totally change through their whol ſubſtance. And when in <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Temper. cap.</hi> 3. he had ſaid that the four Faculties of the Body, Attractive, Retentive, Concoctive, and Expulſive, were in every Body effects of the whol ſubſtance; he adds, that the ſaid whol ſubſtance conſiſts of Hear, Cold, Moiſt and Dry, mingled together. And in Chap. 4. he teaches us to obſerve for a Principle, that every body hath a certain propriety of Temper, which is convenient to this Nature, diſagreeing to that. And hence he gives the reaſon why ſeveral things are Food or Phyſick for ſeveral Creatures; as for inſtance, Hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock is Food for the Starling, and Hellebore for the Quail, which are Medicaments for men; becauſe the temper of the Starling and Quail can aſſimilate the Hemlock and the Hellebore, which Mans Temper cannot do. Moſt late Writers have been of the ſame Opinion, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to raiſe their Minds beyond the Elements.</p>
                  <p>But in very deed the Occult Qualities which act beyond the power of Elementary Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities cannot proceed from the Elements however mixed,
<note place="margin">The mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the firſt Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the occult Qualities.</note> nor from their Qualities how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever tempered. Nor can a hidden way of Mixture bring in new abilities, but which way ſoever the Elements be mixed and remixed, and however their qualities be tempered, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ariſes therefrom but what is Elementary. And the Proportion of manifeſt Qualities being unknown does not of manifeſt make them occult, but only breeds a temper wherein the proportion of the firſt Qualities is unknown to us. The Elementary Qualities are, and remain even under the unknown meaſure of a Temperament; and as in the Temper the Qualities do not change their Eſſence, ſo neither can they perform an action tranſcending their Vertue and activity. For that is a Rule infallibly true, That nothing acts beyond the powers of its own kind. And that Argument which <hi>Jul. Caeſ. Scaliger, Exercit.</hi> 307. <hi>Sect.</hi> 20. uſes to prove, That the Soul does not ariſe from the Elements, is doubtleſs gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and of uſe here. That (ſaies he) is in the powers of the Soul which was never in the power of any Element. But there is nothing in any thing which was not actually in its Principles. For the Principles are the acts of thoſe things whereof they are Principles. Now in the Soul there is a Faculty to move forward, backward, to the right hand, and to the left, which is not in any Element. There are alſo other more illuſtrious powers of the Soul, which are not in the Elements. For what <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaies of the Faculties of the Soul, the ſame may we ſay of the Faculties of the Load-ſtone, of purging Medicaments, of Poyſons, and other things. For nothing acts beyond the vertue of its own kind; and nothing can work as a Cauſe beyond its own adequate Act; ſince it fils the vertue of the Power. And though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vertues be in a mixture than are to be found in the ſimples ſingly conſidered: yet thoſe Vertues are no other than Elementary, and which the ſeveral Elements joyned together have in them; and they are the firſt Qualities broken and allayed by their Contraries. For as I ſaid before, if four or more come to ſup together without every man his ſhot, they muſt of neceſſity al faſt. For examples ſake, If four colors be mixed, a color indeed different from each of the four ariſes, but nothing elſe ſave a color; not ſuch a faculty as is in Scam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, Opium, and the like. After the ſame manner, if you mix the firſt Qualities, and mix them again, other qualities indeed or temperaments wil ariſe different from ſimple Heat, Cold, Moiſture, Drineſs; but no other Quality wil ariſe from thence, ſave an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Quality or Temperament.</p>
                  <p>Nor let any man think to ſcape by ſaying, That the manifeſt Qualities and their Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament do not indeed of themſelves perform ſuch noble actions, but as they are guided by a
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:35070:135" rendition="simple:additions"/>more noble ſpecifick Form. For no Inſtrument acts beyond the vertue of its kind, though it be directed by a ſuperior Agent. And therefore as an Artiſt uſes ſundry Tools, as the Carver his Compaſs, Saw, Chizel, Scraper, every of which performs its uſe: ſo every Form uſes its Qualities to ſundry actions. And as a Saw when the Carpenter uſes it does ſaw aſunder, but does not hew or pare; even ſo Hotneſs where-ever it is does nothing but heat. Not does the Load-ſtone draw Iron, not Rhubarb purge by heat, but by an hidden Quality, peculiar to themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it credible (ſince the Forms of the Elements have their Qualities) that thoſe more noble Forms are barren, and produce no qualities, ſo as to ſtand in need of borrowing the ſervice of the Elementary Qualities. In a word, as things differ in their Forms, ſo do they in their Operations and Inſtruments.</p>
                  <p>Nor do they bring any thing better or righter, who hold,
<note place="margin">Occult Qualities are not drawn out of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the Matter.</note> That in every Mixture a new Form is drawn forth, and that there are alwaies new ones made, the degrees of the former remaining, and that with theſe there ſpring forth new Qualities, and that Nature firſt brings forth the Univerſal Forms, and by their help the particular ones, until at laſt ſhe come to the forms of Individuals; and that from this contemperation of Qualities ariſing from divers Forms and mixture of Bodies, which ſaving their forms do put on the Nature of matter (as it were) or aptitude, there ariſes (they ſay) an unexpreſſible propriety of temper, which may rightly in ſome ſort be termed an occult Quality. For, to paſs over other Errors touching drawings out of Forms, degrees of Forms, and ſuch like; theſe Men alſo ſavor nothing but Elements, and that which they had before rightly determined, viz. That an occult manner of mixture does introduce no new faculties, they themſelves afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy. For ſuppoſe that many mixtures are made, and that with theſe alwaies new Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ariſe: yet becauſe the firſt mixture is only of Elements, and no other temper ariſes from thence but of the firſt Qualities, though you remix things mixed before an hundred, yea, a thouſand times, nothing but what is Elementary, and no Qualities but Elementary Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties can ariſe therefrom, and therefore nobler actions than thoſe of the firſt Qualities cannot be by them produced. And if Natural things ſhould be generated after this manner, and by the mediation of Forms (their degrees ſtil remaining) a progreſs ſhould be made unto par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Forms, and at laſt to ſuch as are individual; the forms of al things living, as wel living things as Plants, ſhould be drawn out of the Elements. Indeed that ſame Innovator,

But this groſs and moſt abſurd Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion can neither be by any reaſons proved, nor can the invincible reaſons of <hi>Julius Caeſar Scaliger</hi> againſt the ſame be anſwered. Which when he perceived, and that he could not find any probable reaſon for his Opinion, no not to make a flouriſh with, he flies to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures miſ-underſtood, and endeavors to ſet <hi>Moſes</hi> againſt <hi>Scaliger,</hi> as if he had ſaid, That al living and lifeleſs things were ſo produced out of the Elements as to conſiſt of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Materials, both in Matter and Form, and to ariſe therefrom at this day; becauſe God ſaid, Let the Earth bring forth, let the Water bring forth the living Creature; alſo, Encreaſe and multiply. But although God ſaid, let the Earth produce, let the Water pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce; yet by force of thoſe words it no waies follows, That Plants and Bruits were made of the Elements both Body and Soul, and are generated of them at this day; ſince God then created perfect Plants and Animals in the Earth and Water, which as <hi>Fr. Junius</hi> writes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this place, came out of the Earth and Water wherein they were created, as Children out of the Womb. Nor does the Hebrew word <hi>Hotzi</hi> ſignifie to give matter, but to make and ſuffer to go out; as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. ver. 18. <hi>Exod.</hi> 8. ver. 18. chap. 20. ver. 2. <hi>Numb.</hi> 17.8. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 68.8. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 104.14. and very many more places of Scripture, appears. Nor did God ſay to the Earth and Water, Encreaſe and multiply, but to living Creatures made by him, and having their ſeed in themſelves; whereof we ſhal alſo ſpeak hereafter in our Fourth Diſcourſe, Chap. 4. <hi>Julius Caeſar Scaliger</hi> ſaies much better in <hi>Exercit.</hi> 307. <hi>Sect.</hi> 20. <hi>Yea, and I tell them withal, That the form of every perfectly mixt Body, although it be no Soul (as that of the Diamond for inſtance) is a fift Nature, far differing from the four Elements.</hi> And in <hi>Exercit.</hi> 307. <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. <hi>If</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>as theſe Tormentors or Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Souls contend, the Souls were made of the Forms of Elements, the Forms them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves corrupted could do more than they could when they were in their Integrity. But in
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:35070:136"/>caſe they will have them remain entire in the Compound, of neceſſity they muſt be by another power different from themſelves both mixed to certain ends and limited in certain bounds. For of them actually exiſting there cannot be made a thing ſimply one, ſave by a ſuperior power, which</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>calls the Beginning of Living things.</hi> And al the Reaſons which prove it, are moſt firm. For who is it that conſiders how in Plants, the Roots, Trunks, Leaves, Flowers, Boughs, are ſo wonderfully and vatiouſly ſhaped, according to the variety of ſorts, in reſpect of magnitude, figure, Scituation, color, and with ſo much Art and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Symmetry, as that no Geometrician or Painter can expreſs al that Art, wil beleeve that al theſe things are wrought by the Elementary matter? who wil beleeve that the moſt noble Fabrick, not only of Men, but of Bruits, is produced by an Elementary Nature? Who wil derive the Sagacity of Dogs, the Prudence (that I may ſo ſpeak) of Elephants, the Craft of the Fox, the Magnanimity of the Lion, the wonderful works of Bees, Piſmites, and other Creatures, from the Elementary Nature? And therefore from hence (as was ſaid) <hi>Scaliger</hi> frames an invincible argument, <hi>Exercit.</hi> 307. <hi>Sect.</hi> 20. <hi>That is in the power of the Soul which was never in the power of any Element. But nothing is in any thing which was not actually in its Principles. For the Principles are the acts of thoſe things whereof they are Principles.</hi> In the anſwering of which Argument, the foreſaid Innovator takes pains to no purpoſe. For firſt, he doth ſeek to elude that ſame Axiome, That Principles are the Acts of thoſe things where of they are Principles, by ſaying that Matter alſo is a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and yet is not the act of a thing. But who ſees not that <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſpeaks of the formal principle, the Cauſe of actions, and that the form is often termed the Principle by way of Eminence. Nor yet is it abſurd to ſay, that even matter alſo in its way hath an act. Indeed it is not the act of the Compound which the Form affords, yet is it in the mean while a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance by it ſelf; and as <hi>Scaliger</hi> in <hi>Exercit.</hi> 5. ſpeaks, it is that which it is by an Eſſence proper to it ſelf. And <hi>Exercit.</hi> 17. The Matter hath its quiddity whereby it is ſomwhat, and differs from other things.
<note place="margin">Whether there be nothing in a thing which was not in its Principles.</note> And the Matter gives Quantity to al things. But againſt that other Axiome, That there is nothing in any thing which was not actually in its Principles, he can bring no reaſon. Verily that which one hath not he cannot give to another Man, and unleſs the Earth were heavy, the Fire hot, no mixt Body would be heavy or hot. And doubtleſs, no affection can be in a Compound which may not be referred either to the Matter or the Form. Yet he endeavors to evade the ſame by ſome inſtances. And in the firſt place he objects the Heaven, how that it is al things in reſpect of its working power. But (which himſelf confeſſes) the Queſtion is not concerning external efficient cauſes, but eſſential in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Principles; and the enquiry is, Whether there be any thing in the Compound which does not depend upon the internal eſſential Principles. Alſo the Heaven it ſelf is an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, and not a particular Cauſe. Moreover he objects life which is from the Soul, but not in the Soul. But he ought to have obſerved what very many of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Expoſitors do note upon the 2.
<note place="margin">Life, how many wais taken.</note> 
                     <hi>de Anima, cap.</hi> 1. that Life is taken two manner of waies: Firſt for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Life, from which as a Fountain Vital actions proceed, which is in the Soul, which is the Root of al vital Powers and Actions, in which ſence <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf takes Life, 2. <hi>de Anima, text.</hi> 37. when he writes, To live is the Eſſence of living things. Secondly, 'tis taken for the Vital Operation, or at leaſt for the power of exerciſing thoſe vital actions, whereof the foreſaid ſubſtantial Life is the Principle; which being an accident, is by many called <hi>Vita accidentaria,</hi> accidentary Life. And therefore unleſs the Soul had life actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it could not communicate the ſame to living Creatures. Here indeed the Paradox-mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſeeks an evaſion to avoid this diſtinction by attributing this eſſential Life only to the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Soul, and the other accidentary to Bruit Beaſts. But he brings no reaſon of this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. Contrariwiſe, all the Expoſitors of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> do attribute Life in both Sences to al Living things. And after the ſame manner, as there is in Man an Eſſential Life, from whence proceeds an accidental (for a Man hath not one Soul to make him a Man, and another to make him a Living thing) even ſo in Bruits alſo and Plants from the eſſential Life it ſelf proceeds that accidentary Life. Yet there is this difference, That in Man by Death the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Life is aboliſhed, the eſſential remaining; but in Beaſts, both eſſential and accidental Life do periſh. Which things were neceſſary to be ſaid in this place for defence of the Truth.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, If Occult Qualities did flow from the Elements, there ſhould be no other ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple qualities in Nature beſides thoſe firſt of the Elements, but al ſhould be tempers of the firſt, and ſo compounded, which is falſe. For the occult Qualities are perfectly ſimple, and ariſe from their ſimple forms; ſince thoſe laſt forms are not barren and idle, but produce cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain peculiar Qualities. For as from the ſimple form of Fire flows heat; ſo from the form
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:35070:136"/>of the Load-ſtone flows the Faculty of drawing Iron, which is a ſimple Quality; from the Form in Rhubarb flows the Quality and Power of Purging Choler, which is a ſimple qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and the ſame holds in al other Occult qualities. For the moſt good and great God hath not drawn al Forms out of the power of the Matter, but created al things, and gave them their Forms; and thoſe not idle and ineffectual, and void of Forces, but endued with their peculiar Qualities, Proprieties, and Activities.</p>
                  <p>Some alſo there are who conceive theſe Qualities are infuſed from the Heavens.
<note place="margin">Whether the occult Qualities flow from Heaven?</note> But ſince they cannot deny, That al Qualities and Proprieties do flow from their Forms, they are forced to grant that theſe Qualities alſo though they come from Heaven, yet it is not without the aſſiſtance of their Forms. But we have elſwhere proved, that the Forms come not from Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Al which Conceits therefore being falſe, it is moſt rightly determined and held,
<note place="margin">The true Original of Occult qualities. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of of Occult qualities.</note> That as al other Faculties and Proprieties, ſo theſe alſo do flow from their Forms. But what thoſe Forms are we muſt now enquire. Which that we may do more readily and Eaſily, we muſt firſt ſhew the differences of theſe Qualities according to their Subjects, or of the ſubſtances to which they belong, whereby it wil appear that they have not al one Original. Bodies are ſome Living, others Liſeleſs; and of the Liſeleſs ſome have had life, as Rhubarb, Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood; others neither have it, nor ever had. All which if they be diſtributed into their Ranks as they ought, ſix differences there will ariſe of Occult Qualities, in reference to their Original.</p>
                  <p>For in the firſt place there are certain hidden and wonderful Properties,
<note place="margin">Occult qualities in certain ſorts of living things.</note> which alwaies are found in ſome ſorts of living Creatures. An example of theſe we have in the Echeners, Remora or Stop-ſhip, a Fiſh ſo called, whoſe ſtrange force (as others, ſo) <hi>Pliny</hi> admires in <hi>lib.</hi> 32. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Let winds blow</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>and the ſtorms rage, a very little Fiſh maſters their fury, and bridles all their ſtrength, forcing the Ships to ſtand ſtill in the Sea; which no Cables could do, no maſſie Anchors. It curbs the violence, and tames the rage of the wind without any pains to it ſelf, not by holding the Ship, nor by any other way than ſticking to the ſame. This little Creature is ſo powerful againſt all the ſtrength of wind and Tide, as to ſtop the Ships in their way. But Armed Fleets have Towers built upon them that they might fight in the Sea as from a City wall. Alas for the vanity of Man-kind! when a little Fiſh half a foot long can arreſt and hold in bondage their Men of War armed for the Fight with Braſs and Iron.</hi> So far <hi>Pliny.</hi> And this is performed by the ſaid Fiſh only when it is alive. Alſo 'cis wel known what force the Torpedo hath, viz. How it does not only benum thoſe that touch is, but it ſtupefies the hands of Fiſher-men through the Net it ſelf. And ſome relate when it ſwims away alive, if a man ſtir the Water with his hand it nums his hand. And yet being dead the ſaid Fiſh is Food for ſome People. How admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the forces of a live Baſilisk are may be ſeen in our <hi>Epitomy of Natural Philoſophy,</hi> Book 7. Chap. 10. yet being dead it may be handled without danger. Such Qualities are rightly derived from the Forms of Animals, concerning the Original whereof we have ſpoken elſwhere more largely, viz. how at the firſt Creation they were all created with Plants and Animals, and are now multiplied in the generation of Plants and living things, and have their Faculties implanted by the Creator.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There are ſome individual Proprieties in living Creatures.
<note place="margin">Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties.</note> So ſome perſons cannot abide Cheeſe, this or that Fiſh, or other meat or drink; and Authors every where obſerve ſundry ſympathies and Antipathies of ſundry Creatures individual. Theſe Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties (ſince they are not common to the whol kind, but proper to ſome Individuals) do not ariſe from the ſpecifical form, nor do they belong to the Eſſential faculties which flow imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from the Form, and like the Form it ſelf are immutable and incapable of degrees; ſuch as is in Man the Faculty of Reaſoning, Laughing, Seeing, Hearing, &amp;c. But to Natural Powers and Impotencies they are to be referred, which flow from a peculiar diſpoſition of the Body, or its parts. Which diſpoſition ſince it is not eſſential to a Man, but variouſly muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, a Natural Power, and a Natural Impotency, may be changed one into another: for examples ſake, It is the Property of a Man among other things, to deſire, digeſt, and be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to turn meats good for his Body into nouriſhment. But in that ſome cannot away with Cheeſe, others with a Pike-fiſh, others with Wine, that ſprings from a Natural Impotency ariſing from a peculiar diſpoſition of the ſtomach in this or that man: which being not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies perpetual (but ſomtimes in progreſs of years, or for other cauſes it is changed) it many times fals out that he who in his Child-hood could not abide Cheeſe, nor to drink Wine, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards being grown up to mans eſtate he can away with both Wine and Cheeſe. Now whereas to Natural Impotencies do belong al thoſe things which belong to any ſickly conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution;
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:35070:137"/>thoſe occult Qualities depend not upon diſtemper, or any Organink Diſeaſe, or of Solution of Unity, but upon an hidden an unexplicable diſpoſition. Indeed for a Man not to be able to deſire to eat, nor to concoct his meat, may proceed from a manifeſt diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the ſtomach: but that he who can eat and digeſt al other meats, only ſhould not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure Cheeſe, or Bread, or this or that ſort of Fleſh or Fiſh; this comes meerly from an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Quality. Now theſe diſpoſitions are ſomtimes born with the party, and ſomtimes they happen afterwards. Of thoſe which are born with the Party, ſome are Hereditary, which being before in the Parents, are derived into the Child with the Principles themſelves of Generation: but others, though they were not in the Parents, yet are they imprinted on the Child by the imagination of the Mother; whence it comes to paſs that Children cannot endure ſuch meats as either their Mothers loathed when they were with Child, or which they longed for, and could not obtain. After Birth they are ſomtimes cauſed by loathing of ſome meat too often and too plentifully eaten. In which caſe the power of the Imagination commonly bears the greateſt ſway, of which I have treated in my Book of the <hi>Conſent and Diſſent of the Chymiſts and Galeniſts, &amp;c. chap.</hi> 14.</p>
                  <p>The third kind of Occult Qualities is of things which do not live,
<note place="margin">Of the Occult Qualities of Jewels, Stones, &amp; Metals.</note> but have neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs their ſpecifick Forms, differing from the Forms of the Elements. So, by Reaſon of its Specifick Form the Load-ſtone draws Iron. And the ſeveral precious Stones, as alſo Metals and Minerals, have their Occult Properties and Faculties, which flow from their Specifick Forms; which Specifick Forms nevertheleſs (as al others) do be concealed from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Man.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,
<note place="margin">Occult Qualities of dead things.</note> There are Occult Proprieties in Natural things which have formerly lived but now do not live any more. Such as are every where to be ſeen in Plants and Animals, which we uſe inſtead of Phyſick. For we uſe not ordinarily living Plants or Animals, but only ſuch as are dead. So we uſe dried Toads to draw out Poyſon: the aſhes of River-crabs or Cray-fiſh cures the biting of a mad Dog: the Horns and Hoof of an Elk are good againſt the Falling-ſickneſs: Harts-horn and the Bone taken out of an Harts Heart, are uſed againſt Poyſons: Mans Skul cures the Falling-ſickneſs: Rhubarb, Agarick, Mechoacan, white and black Hellebore, and other Plants, have a purging faculty: Peony Roots are good againſt the Falling-ſickneſs: Scordium is good againſt Poyſon: and there are very many more rare Vertues of Plants. And to this Tribe in a word belong the Vertues and Hidden Properties which are ſought for in Plants and Animals after they are dead.</p>
                  <p>Now certain it is,
<note place="margin">Whence they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</note> That theſe Occult Properties do not flow immediately from the Soul and Specifick Form of Animals or Plants; ſince the Soul is no longer in thoſe Medicaments. Nor can they proceed from the Mixture of the Elements ſimply, and the temper of the firſt Qualities; ſince their actions are of a quite different kind from them, and above their activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, nor are they directed by the Soul, as being no longer preſent. And ſince every Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pre-ſuppoſes a Form, theſe Qualities muſt alſo of neceſſity flow from, and depend on ſome Form. Now that can be no other than that which was before the ſubject of the more noble perfect and ſpecifick Form, after its manner, and as far as belonged thereto. I ſay, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter its manner, leſt any ſhould have occaſion to quarrel. For that Form with its matter does not quite make up the ultimate ſubject, which is corrupted with the Form it ſelf, or at leaſt does not conſtitute a perfect Organ; ſince in Animals there is alſo required an influent Heat, and in Plants ſomwhat which holds proportion thereto. For ſeeing the more noble Form requires the more noble Matter, and as Forms differ in nobility or baſeneſs, ſo alſo thoſe matters differ, and are proper to ſeveral ſorts and forms of things: the difference and diverſity of thoſe matters cannot come but from different Forms which conſtitute the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſubject of every Sp<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cifick Form. Which Forms (truly) conſidered by themſelves are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo true Forms, which do inform their Matters; but in reſpect of the Soul and Specifick Form they have the Nature of an immediate matter; and ſo one thing does not ſubſiſt by two ſubſtantial acts, but each hath one ſpecifick Form. Now when the Specifick F<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rm goes away, theſe Forms remain a while after, and perform the Office of Forms, and are the Authors of thoſe Faculties which are found in many things after they are dead, but ſuch as 'tis impoſſible they ſhould proceed from the Qualities or Forms of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>Now what the Original of theſe Forms ſhould be,
<note place="margin">Whence the ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Forms <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>roceed</note> is a Queſtion hard enough, and few have enquired thereinto. And becauſe I have ſpoke largely thereof in my <hi>Inſtitutions of Phyſick, Book</hi> 5. <hi>part</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>ch.</hi> 2. I wil but briefly touch the ſame in this place. The moſt wiſe Creator, as he gave in the firſt Creation to al things their ſpecifick Forms, ſo alſo he gave them different matters, to each a proper one, and in that matter alſo certain Forms
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:35070:137"/>proper to every Species; and that for two intents:
<note place="margin">The end of thoſe Forms.</note> Firſt that the ſpecifick Forms might have ſubjects wherein to be, ſubſiſt, and perform their actions. Secondly, That when the Soul or Specifick Form is gone, they might be uſeful to Man as Food or Phyſick. And as thoſe Specifick Forms are multiplied and propagated; ſo alſo theſe ſubordinate Forms are propagated. Or at leaſt (which I ſee is the Opinion of ſome others) the Souls of living things have an ability to produce ſuch Forms as are neceſſary to conſtitute their ſubject place or Manſion houſe, which alſo may remain when they are gone.</p>
                  <p>And foraſmuch as every Form requires its Subject and adequate Matter with which it is,
<note place="margin">The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of theſe forms.</note> and periſhes therewith, it is worth our Labor to enquite of the Subject of theſe Forms. Now this in Plants and Animals ſeems to be no other than that ſame implanted Spirit and Radical Moiſture which joyntly are called commonly Native Hear, and by late Writers (eſpecially Chymiſts) Natural Balſam. For Experience it ſelf teaches, That Plants and the parts of Animals, ſo long as they retain that Balſamick Subſtance, do preſerve their vertues entire: but as ſoon as they loſe the ſame, and become rotten or putrefied, they loſe alſo their vertues, ſo that the remaining Body becomes unprofitable. Which the Operations of Chymiſts and Apothecaries do ſhew. For if by boyling or ſteeping that part of the ſubſtance be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated and extracted, wherein is the Purgative Faculty, an uſeful Medicament is made; and the remaining Body becomes quite ineffectual.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly,
<note place="margin">Occult qualities in things which are naturally bred in Plants &amp; Animals.</note> There are occult o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> hidden Qualities in ſuch things as are Naturally bred in Plants and Animals; ſuch as are the Poyſon of a Scorpion, an Aſp, an Adder, the Spider <hi>Tarantu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> and other venemous Beaſts; Bezoar ſtone, Musk, Civer, Caſtoreum, and whatever other things there are of like kind Naturally bred in Animals. Hither are to be referred the juy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Plants, their Tears and Gums, as Aloes, Scammony, Elaterium, Euphorbium, <hi>Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bugia,</hi> Opium, juyce of Hemlock, and many more of this kind. All which though they are to Men in place of Medicament or Poyſon, yet are they Natural and kindly to their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Plants and Animals. Now al ſuch Qualities and their effects do not proceed imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from the Soul or Specifick Form of thoſe living things, but from their own proper Form; ſince being ſeparated from the living things, they have nevertheleſs their effects and operations. Now whence theſe Forms proceed, though it is not very eaſie to declare; yet it ſeems moſt ſafe to hold, That thoſe things receive the ſaid Forms from their own Souls, and that thoſe Forms are ſome way included in the Souls, or at leaſt proceed from them. For as the ſoul hath a power to make Chyle, to make bones, and to make skin; even ſo other Juyces are produced in other living things, as Oyl in the Olive Tree, Wine in the Vine; and after the ſame manner thoſe Medicinal and venemous juyces aforeſaid are produced by the Soul proper to their reſpective kind. And as Wine though no longer animated with the Soul of the Vine, yet retains many yeers that ſame form which it received from the Vine as a Body Natural; ſo the juyces lately mentioned do long retain their Forms and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues entire; yea, and they have ſome affinity to, and correſpondence (as it were) with the forms of that kind, and perform motions anſwerable to their motions. Whence it is that Wine in the Hogshead is wont to work when the Vines do bloſſom. For the reaſon of all ſuch things lies concealed in the ſeed; becauſe (as <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> 5. <hi>de Gen. anim. cap.</hi> 7. ſaies) Principles of things though ſmal in Bulk, yet are exceeding great in faculty and power, which is eſpecially true of the ſeed; and what <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaid excellently, <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>quaeſt. nat. cap.</hi> 29. concerning Man, is true of al other living things. In the ſeed (ſaies he) <hi>is contained all the Nature of the future man; the Infant not born hath in it the Principles of a beard, and of Gray Hairs.</hi>
                  </p>

                  </head>
                  <p>NOw Occult Qualities are not of one kind,
<note place="margin">The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of occult qualities.</note> and the firſt difference appears from what hath been ſaid in the foregoing Chapter, by which it is manifeſt that there are ſix kinds of them in reference to their Original, touching which 'tis needleſs to add any more.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place, There is another difference drawn from the manner of inhering. Vulgarly, as alſo it appears from <hi>Scaliger, Exercit.</hi> 71. they ſay ſome Qualities are real,
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:35070:138"/>others intentional. The greenneſs on the Tree they ſay is a real Quality, the greenneſs caſt by the Tree upon a wall, or on a mans cloaths, is an intentional Quality: the color of a Glaſs of Claret is a real Quality, the redneſs thereby cauſed upon the Table-cloath is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentional quality, the light ſhining through the Glaſs of Wine. Where the thing it ſelf is truly declared, but the names are not convenient. For ſince that is properly termed inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional which depends upon the operation of our mind, and is nothing without the ſame: after this manner theſe Occult Qualities cannot be termed intentional, nor are rightly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to real Qualities, ſince they themſelves are alſo real, and are found in Nature when we think not of them, and have real effects. I conceive the color in the Tree, and the Wine in the Glaſs ſhould be more rightly called material qualities, ſeeing they are not ſeparated from the Matter;
<note place="margin">Material Qualities and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, how they differ.</note> but the other Spiritual Species or repreſentations. And there is no ſmal difference betwixt thoſe material qualities, and theſe Spiritual Species. For the former are in their Subject, and are moved with it, and according to its motion, nor are ſeparable therefrom, and are ſucceſſively received in their Subject, nor are they divers differing in number in the ſame Subject, not confuſed but diſtinct. But thoſe Spiritual Species are diffuſed from the Body whence they ariſe round about in a right line like Raies, nor are moved with the air wherein they are; in the ſame Subject they are many in number, not confuſed, as appears by the ſundry ſhadows made by ſeveral Candles; alſo many of them paſs through ſolid Bodies, as appears by ſounds, and the vertue of the Load-ſtone. Nor are they ineffectual, but have in them the vertues of thoſe things from which they flow; as Shine repreſents the Light; the Load-ſtone draws Iron, the ſhadow of the Eugh tree is hurtful. And although theſe Species are commonly reckoned only amongſt Senſible Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; yet doubtleſs there are many more of them than are diſcerned by Humane Senſes. And by means of them many Sympathies and Antipathies of things do happen, and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful actions and operations, which are by ſome termed Magnetical. Which very thing <hi>Jul. Caeſ. Scaliger</hi> acknowledgeth, who in <hi>Exercit.</hi> 344. <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. where he ſpeaks of Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy, at laſt concludes, That ſuch things are done by Species, and that thoſe Species are like a continual Ray promoted, which is propagated through and beyond the Body of the Glaſs.</p>
                  <p>But what theſe Spiritual Species are is not eaſie to ſay.
<note place="margin">What ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are.</note> They are commonly called Qualities; but this term likes not <hi>Fracaſtorius, Lib. de Sympath. &amp; Antip. cap.</hi> 5. who holds that they are Subſtances, and of the ſame nature with thoſe Forms whoſe Species they are, not differing from them ſave in their manner of ſubſiſting. For ſo far he ſaies they are Material, becauſe they are in the matter by a certain groſs exiſtence, and require certain li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits. And ſince it is the innate property of al Forms to propagate themſelves, and theſe material Forms cannot propagate themſelves after their own manner of exiſtence, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a thin and Superficial part or degree of themſelves, which they term <hi>Epipole,</hi> which by reaſon of its tenuity both hath no contrary, and is bred and propagated in a moment, as a kind of Brood. But hardly wil any man ſay, That the Light and Shine of the Sun are of the ſame Eſſence one with another, much leſs that they are of the ſame Nature with the Suns Form; or the color in a thing with that in its Image in a Looking-glaſs. But how (in caſe they are Qualities) they ſhould be generated in a moment and propagated, not moved with the Air through which they are diffuſed, and that divers in number of the ſame ſort ſhould be in the ſame Air unconfounded or jumbled together, there is hardly any man can well tell.</p>
                  <p>For the ſame obſcurity we meet with in the ſenſible Species of Nature, we find alſo in all other her Spiritual Species, which are many more than can be diſcerned by our Senſes, or is commonly believed.</p>
                  <p>According to this Difference of Qualities Occult Qualities alſo differ.
<note place="margin">Occult material Qualities.</note> For firſt there are Occult Qualities which may be termed Material becauſe they are alwaies propagated with the Matter and Subject wherein they are generated, and do not diffuſe themſelves without the ſame. And though they may ſeem to diffuſe themſelves into other bodies, and afar off; yet that is done by Atomes and their ſmalleſt Corporeal Particles, which differ from the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies from whence they flow only in Magnitude, and have the ſame Eſſence, Qualities, and Faculties with them. Such are al thoſe Occult Qualities by which contagious Diſeaſes are conveighed into other perſons, as is ſeen in the Venereal Diſeaſe, the Leprofie, Peſtilential and Contagious Feavers, and the Plague it ſelf. For in al ſuch Diſeaſes certain very ſmal particles flow from the ſick body, which being received by other bodies they raiſe in them the ſame Diſeaſe; as I have ſhewed at large in the <hi>Second of my Inſtitutions, part</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. and my <hi>Fourth Book of Feavers, Chap.</hi> 3. and my <hi>Sixt Book of Practice, p.</hi> 3.
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:35070:138"/>
                     <hi>cap.</hi> 3. For theſe are not Species carried right on as a Ray, but little Particles or ſmal Bodies which are themſelves diſorderly moved by the motion of the Air: nor is any man infected either with the Plague, Venereal Pox, or Leproſie, unleſs he receive into his Body ſome of thoſe foreſaid Particles or ſmal Bodies.</p>
                  <p>Again, There are Occult Qualities which are juſtly termed ſpiritual Species,
<note place="margin">Spiritual Qualities.</note> becauſe they paſs from their Body like a Ray continually thruſt forward, being circularly diffuſed, and have a certain Sphere of their activity, and ſome of them do alſo pierce through other Bodies. So a Load-ſtone draws Iron though a Board be betwixt them: a Cat ſhut up in a cheſt can affect a Man that hath an Antipathy againſt Cats; the Dog through the ſhut door by vertue of theſe Qualities knows his Maſter to be there; the <hi>Torpedo</hi> benums the Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans hand through the ſtaff of an Eel-ſpear. And <hi>Avicenna</hi> and the Conciliator in <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Venen. cap.</hi> 1. ſpeak of a Serpent who intected and killed a Soldier through a Spear, with the end whereof he touched it. So the Baſilisk or Cockatrice kils a Man by looking on him. Which things the foreſaid Qualities adhering in the matter cannot do. Nor can a Man ſick of a contagious Diſeaſe infect another through the door (being ſhut) ſince thoſe ſmal bodies cannot pierce the boards.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">The third difference of Occult qualities.</note> There is yet another Difference of Occult Qualities obſerved as yet by very few, viz. There are ſome Spiritual Qualities which flow from other things, are received in ſome Bodies, and being received in them they have the ſame Faculty as the others. Such a like thing is obſerved in the Load-ſtone. For the Vertue thereof is received by Iron, whereupon the Iron alſo gains the faculty of drawing Iron, and moving to the Poles. Not is this only done by rubbing upon the Load-ſtone, and the communication of certain Atomes; ſeeing Iron ſhut up and covered wil receive vertue from the Load-ſtone, which I my ſelf have obſerved. For having once an Ivory-cover'd Sun-Dial made with a touched Needle, in the ſame caſe or box with a greater Load-ſtone, the Needle of the Sun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>dial quite changed its faculty of turning to the Poles, and was moved with a new kind of motion. So Dogs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Maſters, and they hunt the Beaſts by the track of their feet, ſuch ſpecies being doubtleſs printed upon the Earth and Graſs which they perceive by their ſmelling faculty. For it muſt needs be ſome real thing that works upon their Smel, and yet not a material qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which with its ſmal bodies hath no fixed manſion, but is inordinately moved with the motion of the Air. And I am confirmed in my Opinion by <hi>Nicolas Cabeus,</hi> in <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. of his <hi>Magnetick Philoſophy, cap.</hi> 21. where he informs us, That Iron attains its verticity or a faculty of turning towards the Poles, not only by touching the Load-ſtone, but by being near the ſame alſo. Take (ſaies he) a Needle which hath never touched a Load-ſtone; and hang it up by a thred, then hold it towards the Load-ſtone, but ſo that it may move to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Load-ſtone, but not touch the ſame, nay, that it may be a pretty diſtance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from; I ſay, it will ſo come to paſs, that the Needle ſhal receive vertue from the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone not only by touching it, but alſo by approaching the ſame without touching: yea, it would derive into it ſelf the vertue of the Load-ſtone, although ſome other Body were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed betwixt the Needle and the Load-ſtone, as Wood, Stone, or any other. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears firſt by experience. For if (as I ſaid) the Needle be hung up ſo far off, that it aſpires indeed to touch the Load-ſtone, but cannot do it, either becauſe it is held afar off, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome other Body is interpoſed betwixt it and the Load-ſtone; If afterward you take away the Load-ſtone the hanging Needle wil ſhew al the magnetical Effects moſt clearly, which before it did not ſhew, even as if it had touched the Load-ſtone. For ballanced it will turn to the Poles, its point looking alwaies to the North, according to the magnetick Laws, and it wil draw filed Iron; ſo that try it which way you will, it wil continually moſt clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evidence its magnetick Vertue, which did not appear before it had ſo made its approaches to the Load-ſtone. Therefore the Load-ſtone conveighs its Verticity and Vertue into the Iron not only by touching the ſame, but by its preſence alone if it come but near the ſame. Moreover, this is alſo apparent by Reaſon. For the Loadſtone hath not only in it ſelf a Magnetical Vertue, and conſequently a Faculty in it ſelf to produce the ſame in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies having affinity thereto, but it alſo ſheds forth round about the ſaid Vertue, and forms to it ſelf a Sphere of activity. And many other ſuch like Species there are (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs) which pierce as eaſily through the moſt ſolid Bodies, as through the thinneſt Air. So far <hi>Cabeus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now ſuch Qualities are received in any Body agreeable thereto. So the magnetick Quality is received in the moſt pure Iron. Alſo the ſame <hi>Cabeus</hi> writes, it is received in thoſe Bricks which through vehement burning have gained the color of Iron, and are therefore either from their color or hardneſs called Iron Bricks. <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Philoſoph.
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:35070:139"/>Magnet. Cap.</hi> 8. and if you take a bit of ſuch a Brick, and touch it artificially up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſtrong Load-ſtone, it receives (he ſaies) the Quality of turning to the two Poles of the World.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,
<note place="margin">The fourth Difference.</note> Occult Qualities are alſo diſtinguiſhed in reſpect to their effects, in regard ſome cauſe Sympathy, others Antipathy, examples whereof are every where to be ſeen in Nature, and they are collected by <hi>Fracaſtorius</hi> in his Book <hi>de Sympathia &amp; Antip.</hi> Marcellus Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus, <hi>de Hiſtor. Med. mirabil.</hi> Johan. Franciſc. Ulmus, <hi>de Occult. in art. med. proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat.</hi> Andreus Libavius, <hi>part</hi> 2. <hi>ſingul. tr.</hi> 4. Johannes Schenckius, <hi>Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Obſerv. in ſine.</hi> which I think needleſs to repeat in this place.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly,
<note place="margin">The fiſt difference.</note> There is a certain difference which <hi>Galen</hi> reckons up, 6. <hi>Epidem. com.</hi> 6. <hi>text.</hi> 6. where he divides things which work by Propriety of their whol ſubſtance into four kinds; Aliments,
<note place="margin">Occult quality of Aliments.</note> Medicaments, Poyſons, and Antidotes, wherein are comprehended al things in Nature, Minerals, Stones, Plants, Living things. And as to Aliments or Foods, of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity ſome likeneſs there muſt be and ſympathy between the Food and that which is nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed thereby; which conſiſts not only in the firſt Qualities, and their Temperament, but alſo in the whol ſubſtance and occult qualities; which even hereby appears, in that there is not one Aliment of al living things, but ſundry Aliments. For ſeveral Plants growing in the ſame Field do each draw its own proper Aliment, and as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> writes, <hi>Things that grow and are ſown, when they come into the ground each draws that which it finds in the Earth ſuitable to its Nature. Now that is ſowr, and bitter, and ſweet, and ſalt, and all kinds of Juyces.</hi> And the ſame holds in Animals. For ſuch things as are poyſon to a Man are food to ſome Creatures; as Hellebore to the Quail, Hemlock to the Starling, Frogs, Snakes, Toads to the Storks. Yea, and ſome men delight in ſome kinds of Meats, and abhor other ſome.</p>
                  <p>Now it is a thing not to be doubted that moſt of the Vertues of Medicaments proceed from occult Qualities.
<note place="margin">The qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments.</note> Purgatives exerciſe their Operations by occult Qualities. And ſo do ſpecifical Medicaments, and thoſe which are proper to ſeveral parts of the Body; alſo Amulets, and al things that help or hurt the Body, externally applied. Hitherto pertain Smels, Fumigations, and thoſe hidden ſteams which work upon Man and Beaſt; as it is very wel known how Dogs follow their Maſters and wild beaſts footing by the ſcent; and ſome cannot endure a Cat in the room though they ſee it nor, as was ſaid before: not to ſpeak now of ſuch things as mutually work one upon another by ſeeing and hearing. Of al which <hi>Johannes Franciſc. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lmus</hi> brings many examples in his whol Third Book <hi>de Occult. in arte Medica Proprietat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And touching Poyſons,
<note place="margin">The Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Venoms.</note> it is ſo manifeſt that they act by occult Qualities, that <hi>Julius Caeſar Scaliger</hi> writes wel in <hi>Exercit.</hi> 218. <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. If nothing elſe could perſwade us how vainly and raſhly many endeavor to reduce al things to manifeſt Qualities, at leaſt poyſons and their Remedies might teach us ſo much.</p>
                  <p>And the ſame may be ſaid of Antidotes,
<note place="margin">Of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes.</note> ſeeing they are oppoſed to Poyſons, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as Poyſons are hurtful to our body, nor by manifeſt, but by Hidden Qualities; ſo are theſe alſo contrary to Poyſons, not by manifeſt, but by Hidden Qualities.</p>
                  <p>And whoever ſhal obſerve what hath been here ſaid in general of Occult Qualities, he may with little difficulty underſtand ſuch things as he ſhal meet with in the Writings of Natural Philoſophers and Phyſitians concerning the ſaid Qualities.</p>

And this Opinion was a moſt ancient Opinion, and is now attributed to one <hi>Mochus</hi> a <hi>Phaenician,</hi> who is reputed to have flouriſhed before the deſtruction of <hi>Troy;</hi> yea, and that it was the common Opinion of Philoſophers before <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> is apparent from the beginning of his Second Book <hi>de Generat. &amp; Corrupt.

Yea, the Reaſons brought for this Opinion are not light or fooliſh, but ſtrong and urging, and which can hardly be anſwered, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf confeſſe, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Generat. &amp; Corrupt. cap.</hi> 2. <hi>text.</hi> 6. and which he cannot certainly promiſe to anſwer, but he would try what he could do. And doubtleſs he knew he could not ſollidly refute this Opinion, and therefore he uſed not proper and Phyſical Reaſons as he ought to have done, but Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and extravagant ones.</p>
                  <p>Now I conceive the Doctrine of Atomes may be thus explained.
<note place="margin">The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Atomes explained.</note> In Natural things ſubject to Generation and Corruption, becauſe there is a perpetual Interchange of Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and corrupting, there muſt needs be certain ſimple bodies, each of a nature by itſelf, out of which the Compounds may be generated, and into which Compounds are again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved. For <hi>Democritus</hi> ſeeing that Bodies Natural were neither made of nothing, not made of Points, he was forced to hold they were made of the ſmalleſt Bodikies. Where it is to be noted, That <hi>Democritus</hi> did not enquire, Whether there were an individual Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Magnitude; but whether there were Natural Bodikies of an indiviſible ſmalneſs, out of a multitude of which gathered together a certain ſurt of natural Body does ariſe.

Of them <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Timaeus</hi> thus writes: Touching theſe ſo ſmal Bodikies we are thus to think, That if you take only one ſingle one of a kind, there is none of them can be ſeen by us in regard of its ſmalneſs; but it many are collected together, their bulk and magnitude is diſcernable. For neither are thoſe little Bodikies we ſee floating up and down in the Sun-beams ſuch Atomes as we ſpeak of, but compounded Bodies.

And indeed every where amongſt Philoſophers and Phyſicians both Ancient and Modern, mention is made of theſe little Bodikies or Atomes, that I wonder the Doctrine of Aromes ſhould be traduced as a Novelty. That I may not ſpeak of others beſides thoſe whom I have already praiſed, who may be ſuſpected as Contemoers of the Ancient Philoſophy, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of Novelties; <hi>Franciſcus Aquilonius, Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Opticae deſin.</hi> 5. thus writes: Amongſt
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:35070:140"/>Elementary Qualities, the two which are termed paſſive are exceeding far from the Nature of Light. For neither does Humidity ſignifie a Quality, nor Humectation an alteration. For humidity in the ſubſtance of Water is the ſame thing that fattineſs is in the ſubſtance of Oyl; and as fat makes Greaſie by being ſmeared upon a thing, ſo moiſture moiſtens on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by ſticking to a thing. Again drineſs is only the defect of moiſture, and exſiccation the conſumption of Humor. And among the active Qualities Cold ſends forth no coldneſs out of it ſelf: which though it may to ſome ſeem ſtrange, yet is it agreeable to reaſon, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience manifeſtly demonſtrates the ſame. For the coldeſt body that is (to feel to) as Ice, does ſend forth no ſenſe of coldneſs to ones hand that is neer it; but al cold things are percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be ſo only by handling them. Which (to ſuch as denied the ſame) I have often made appear by a pleaſant experiment: for their eyes being blinded and their hand held forth, I would ask them if they felt the coldneſs of the Ice neer their hand. For ſomtimes they would ſay they felt ſomwhat when there was nothing near them; and otherwhiles they would ſay they felt nothing when the Ice was ſo neer their hand as it did almoſt touch the ſame. And a while after he ſaies; Heat ſeems to diffuſe it ſelf abroad like Light. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, I account it (truly) moſt likely that from the kindled ſewel a kindled vapor does flie abroad, which being ſecretly conveighed through the Air does heat every thing it touches, and alſo burns the ſame if it have any thickneſs. Hence it comes to paſs that things ſet near a blazing fire are burned though they do not touch the viſible fire it ſelf, which is often ſeen in Paper and Tow; but much more apparently in Naphtha, Aſphaltum, Amber, and ſuch like, which draw the flame to them from afar. Hence alſo it comes to paſs that the fire heats more ſtrongly and fiercely aloft than beneath or on the ſides, viz. Becauſe the infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vapor attenuited by Heat endeavors to mount upwards. Which truly does not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly agree to a quality, but to a ſubſtance. Nor can you rightly ſay Heat is Light, but that which is hot. For that being by the force of heat rarefied becomes lighter; as that is heavier which by condenſation of the matter is brought into a narrower compaſs. Hence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the true cauſe may be rendred, why in the Winter flames do blaze more luſtily: for the ſurrounding cold hinders the heat from ſpreading it ſelf abroad in the Air. And in the ſame Book, <hi>Propoſit.</hi> 2. We muſt cal to mind what was ſaid, <hi>definit.</hi> 5. of this Book, how that the Heat of the Fire is not carried along by a continual action, but is ſecretly conveighed through the Air, juſt as ſmels which breath out of odoriferous Bodies, and being received in the th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But being ſet at liberty it wanders more freely through the Air, and is driven any way by the lighteſt motion, and by its ſticking to them things never grow warm, as thoſe which are placed by odotiferous bodies do ſmel ſweet only by exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſticking to them. Soldiers in their Camps find this by experience, when having cut down a great deal of Wood they pile it up and ſet it on fire in the middle of a field, and ſtand round about the ſame. For they that have the wind on their backs do feel hardly any heat although they ſtand cloſe by the fire, the fiery ſpirits being thereby carried unto the oppoſite ſide; which the wind could not do if only a qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>d that there are Atomes.</note> For if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with Experience, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſo commended in <hi>Democritus,</hi> we ſhal find both the Generations and Corruptions of things to be made by Atomes, and that there are every where in Nature examples of the uniting and ſeparating of Atomes. And ſince there is not only one kind of Atomes, but that they are various according to the variety of Bodies, I conceive it wil be beſt to conſider them both in reſpect to the Elements ſo called, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to bodies compound.</p>
                  <p>For in the firſt place, The Elements themſelves are reſolved into ſuch Bodies, and the ſoid Bodies joyning again do make up not only Compounds, but alſo the bulk it ſelf of the Elements. Now theſe Atomes or indiviſible Bodikies of the Elements do ariſe both out of the reſolution and corruption of Compounds, and likewiſe out of the Terrene Globe (where in are al Elements) and are carried up into the Air; whence proceed ſundry mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Air, and Generations and Corruptions, which variouſly affect both Man and Beaſts, and Plants. For it is very true of the firſt Atomes or indiviſible Bodikies, that if we take but one Atome of a kind there are none of them viſible: but if many of them be gathered together their magnitude and bulk is diſcernable, which (as hath been ſaid) <hi>Plato</hi> alſo teaches us in his <hi>Timaus.</hi> Since therefore theſe Bodies are moſt ſmal and ſubtile,
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:35070:141"/>they do both eaſily pierce into other Bodies, and afford matter alſo to others.</p>
                  <p>Torun through al kinds of Natural Bodies,
<note place="margin">Fiery A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes or Bodikies.</note> and firſt as to Elements; Fire inſinuates it ſelf into Iron and Water. The ſame being inſenſibly in the Summer mixt with the Air makes ſoultry hot weather; yea, and (as Experience ſhews) hath burnt up Woods ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times. It is variouſly mingled alſo with other things, and according to its vatious commix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture makes ſundry ſorts of things. Fire indeed of it ſelf (as <hi>Jul. Caeſ. Scal.</hi> teaches) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhines nor burns; but that it ſhines and burns it comes to paſs by the admixtute of another Body, and the propinquity of the parts, by whoſe co-action in a ſmaller ſpace the ſubſtance is greater, and therefore the force is greater. But being rarefied it burns not, nor does it ſhine. That ſmoak which aſcends hath much fire in it. Nor yet hath it any burning Faculty, nor ſhines it at al with any light: and ſuch things as are roaſted on Spits are not touched by that fire which we ſee; yet are they ſo touched by fire, as that they are ſomtimes burnt to a Coal. Yet is not that fire viſible which burns them. And the ſame <hi>Scaliger, Exercit.</hi> 325. <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. Fire is much more tranſparent than the Air, becauſe it is thinner. The Fire which we uſe is yellow becauſe of mixture. For there is fire in a vapor, in ſmoak, in burning coals, in a flame; and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> cals a flame burning ſmoak, and that not amiſs. For the flame ſeems to be no other thing than the meeting together and union of the particles of fire, the heterogeneal ſubſtances being ſeparated. For whereas by reaſon of diſtance and commixture of Contraries the ſmal bodies of fire could not joyn together, the obſtacle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken away they begin to be united. Hence it happens that if the chamber where fire is kept be cloſe ſhut the fire wil not flame, but as ſoon as the Air is let in, and thoſe heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal bodies are diſcuſſed, the flame breaks forth. Nor yet is flame abſolutely pure, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in it ſelf ſome heterogeneal Matter, which the color alone does ſhew. But that fire which is above the flame is purer; and therefore is not ſeen. For by reaſon of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent concourſe of the Atomes divers bodies ſeem to ariſe which yet are of one Nature. The Fire is but one thing, yet undergoes divers names, according to the different concourſe of its ſmal bodikies. The Concourſe of many homogeneal bodikies of fire is requiſite to make fire in ſuch a condition as to ſhine and burn; which two things though fire does not, yet is it fire ſtil.</p>
                  <p>Now Air is in al bodies almoſt.
<note place="margin">Aerial Atomes.</note> For ſince moſt Natural Bodies are porous, Air fils thoſe empty ſpaces naturally. Not to ſpeak of other things, ſome Metals are ſounding, others not. And thoſe which ſound have Air in their pores, which is the ſubject of ſound. So Woods are apt to admit ſound, which happens only by means of the Air contained in them. And this is moſt frequent in dried Woods; becauſe the watty moiſture being conſumed, which was unfit to receive ſounds, Air comes into its place by its quality more fit to receive and advance ſounds. And if a man touch a ſtick at one end, and put the other end to his ear, be ſhal hear a ſound. Which comes to paſs by means of the Air which is contained in them, ſeem they never ſo ſolid. And Soldiers are wont to try whether their Enemies are coming by clapping their Ears cloſe to the Earth.</p>
                  <p>Water or moiſt Air (which is nothing but Air ful of the vapors of water) does ſo inſinuate it ſelf into wooden things that they wil even be thereby ſwollen in bulk.

And tubs that leak being laid in water come to hold again, becauſe the boards which were contracted and made chinks, are by the water diſtended.</p>
                  <p>Finally,
<note place="margin">Earthy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes or Bodikies.</note> The Earth though it be thick, yet it inſinuates it ſelf by its ſmal bodikies into other things, and is mixed with them. So we ſee in Baths, Iceſickles, and ſtoney ſubſtances grow to the Channels, ſo that a man might wel wonder how ſuch a body could lie ſo long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed in clear and tranſparent Water. If therefore Air and Water can ſo inſinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into ſolid Bodies, and Earth can be ſo mingled in tranſparent Water as not to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by the ſight, why therefore may not fire do the fame which is much more ſubtile? So that there is now no need to diſpute how red hot Iron burns, ſince really it contains in it the Atomes or ſmal bodies of fire, which vaniſhing away it returns to its Natural actual coldneſs. For the ſame cauſe alſo Metals are melted, and afterwards growing cold become hard again. Of which we ſhal ſpeak anon.</p>
                  <p>Which if a man diligently conſider,
<note place="margin">Alteration what it is. What hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is.</note> he ſhal obſerve, That alterations commonly ſo called are not mutations only in Qualities, but the participation of another Body: that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of water is it a participation of fiery Atomes, by means of which alſo it hath the power to burn, which vaniſhing the water returns to its ancient coldneſs. Which alſo may be known even by Experience; for hot water ſhut up in Peuter Pots wil retain its heat ten hours and longer in the Winter time; by which means Beds are warmed in the Winter, and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:35070:141"/>travelling by Coach defend their feet from the Winters cold. For if the water had contracted only heat from the fire, that imprinted quality in a cold place, in a Veſſel made of Metal, and in the cold air, could not continue ſo long a time. There are therefore (doubtleſs) fiery particles, which being ſhut up in a thick Metalline Veſſel do for ſome time abide there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, before they can al leiſurely creep out through the pores of a compact Body. So in the Summer time we are taught by this following Experiment, That Wine and Beer do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contract an hot quality in the heated Air, but that they alſo receive into themſelves fiery particles, viz. If two Veſſels be filled at the ſame time with Wine or Beer, and both be plunged a good way into cold water, and then one be ſtopped, the other open, that Wine or Beer in the open mouthed Veſſel is ſooner cooled than that in the ſtopt veſſel; which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore happens becauſe the fiery Atomes which did heat the Liquor being compelled by the force of contrary coldneſs do ſooner exhale when they have a free paſſage than when by ſtopping the veſſels mouth they are reſtrained. Yea, and it is not abſurd to ſay the Air in our ſtoves is not only altered, but receives into it ſome of the ſubſtance of the fire. Nor is it impoſſible that the fire ſhould pierce through the furnace, ſince air (not ſo ſubtile as fire) pierces both into Iron and ſtone Jugs. Yea, and the thing it ſelf reſtifies thus much; for we ſee paper, cloaths, and other combuſtible things being held near the hot ſtove do oftentimes take flame. And if thoſe ſuppoſed alterations are meerly ſuch, how can heat and cold be in the ſame part of the water; and ſeeing no accident operates but by vertue of its form whence it flows, how can that heat ſpringing from the fire act both upon the cold and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other Bodies, the fire whence it came being now abſent and quenched. Now whether is more abſurd to hold that in water there is alſo fire, from whence as its proper ſubject heat flows? or to hold heat to be both in its own proper, and in a ſtrange ſubject? And that this is true many moſt learned men have acknowledged, and amongſt the reſt <hi>Averrhoes,</hi> who in his B. <hi>de Anima, text.</hi> 115. writes: We muſt not think that water is heated remaining pure and meet water, nor that Air is cooled remaining meer and pure Air; but this happens by reaſon o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For the cold Atomes mixt with the air and ſticking to the Plants do more hurt than when they are ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. <hi>Julius Caeſar Scaliger</hi> grants as much, when in <hi>Exercit.</hi> 12. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. he ſaies that Braſs becomes hot by the parts of the fire entring into the pores thereof. The ſame <hi>Scaliger, Exercitat.</hi> 14. teaches us, That boyling water is fiery, or hath in it fire and drineſs; and he writes that the fire exhales out of hot water: <hi>There is</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>fire and drineſs in hot Water, which in the ſteam aſcending we perceive by our underſtanding, and by our ſenſe alſo; for it burns. The heat which is in water is fire mingled with its contrary.</hi> Yea, and <hi>Galen</hi> taught this long ago, who in his 1. Book <hi>de Element. cap.</hi> 6. ſaies, <hi>I ſay that be who in the time of froſt is warmed with the fire, does receive fire into his Body.</hi> And that the ſubſtance of fire and air does penetrate into other bodies, this alſo argues that the digeſtions which are performed in dung or hot water can never be exactly accompliſhed in the Embers, whatever degree of heat you ſhal uſe; and becauſe in an hot and dry ſubject a thing is eaſily burned, but not in an hot and moiſt. Alſo the Cure of burns, and of parts nummed with cold, as alſo other things congealed with cold do ſhew, that alterations hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſo eſteemed are not meer alterations, but the mixture of a certain kind of Atomes. For if a man ſhal put frozen Eggs or Apples into hot water (which ſhould be done were it a meer alteration) they wil be ſpoiled: but if he plunge them in extream cold Water, the froſt is drawn, and ſticks like Ice upon the out ſide, and they are preſerved. So thoſe that travel in the Winter, as is wel known to the Inhabitants of <hi>Norway</hi> and other Northern Countries (nor is it altogether unknown to our people) and have their Members frozen as it were; if they come preſently to the fire or into an hot room, they are very much hurt and exceedingly pained, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But if their Members are firſt rubbed with Snow, or are plunged into cold water, the water or Snow do draw unto themſelves by reaſon of ſimilitude thoſe atomes and petty cold bodies which had gotten into the part. Contrariwiſe, when any Member is any waies burnt, if it be plunged into cold water (which the Law of alteration requires) it is moſt certainly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered. Contrarily 'twil be cured if it be put, not into cold but hot water, which may by ſimilitude draw to it ſelf thoſe hot bodikies: and if the burning be not great, the Member may be held to the fire, or hot embers may be applied thereto. Of which <hi>Fernelius,</hi> 6. <hi>de Method. Medendi, cap.</hi> 20. As the fire, if a part which is burned be held neer the ſame, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a cure of the evil it ſelf cauſed, and by drawing back the fire eaſes it of its pain; ſo
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:35070:142"/>ſome things externally applied do by their hear draw out the heat of the fire, and ſo by cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Inflammation they cure burnings. For fire and hot things do by ſimilitude draw out the fiery Atomes. And for this very cauſe (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> writes in the 13. Probleme of the 24. Section) hot things are faſter cooled in the Sun than in the ſhade, becauſe the beams of the Sun draw out the fiery Atomes.</p>
                  <p>But that ſame Opinion of <hi>Thomas Fienus</hi> is altogether abſurd,
<note place="margin">The Fire is no Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</note> who in his Apology a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Sanctacruz,</hi> Page 50. ſaies, that this Fire of ours which we uſe (he cals it artificial and earthly, unfitly; ſince it is moſt natural and of the ſame ſubſtance with that Fire which is in other parts of the world, although it be in a thicker matter) is an Accident; and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives that thoſe things which are ſaid to be Fired, or thoſe ſubſtances which men are wont to call Fire, as Iron, Coals, Flame, are indeed Subſtances: but that which is in them more than their own ſubſtance, by reaſon of which they are called Fire, or are ſaid to burn, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to be a ſubſtance, and thinks that the flerineſs adds nothing to the burning Iron, Wood, or Furnace, but an Accident, viz. a moſt intenſe Heat, and that he endeavors thus to prove.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He ſaies, a ſubſtance is not capable of more onleſs. That ſame firineſs in the Iron, Wood, Furnace, admits of more and leſs. <hi>Ergo</hi> it is no ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When the Iron is red hot or the ſmoak flames, the whol Iron is fired, and the fire is in all the parts thereof. If therefore the fire were a ſubſtance, in all the parts of the burning Iron there would be another ſubſtance, and conſequently one ſubſtance ſhould be in another, and ſo there would be a penetration of dimenſions; which is abſurd.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He ſaies: When the Iron becomes red hot, either the ſubſtance of the fire comes into the Iron from without, or it is generated in the pores thereof. he conceives neither of theſe can be: Not the firſt, becauſe neither the Coal of the fire becauſe it is thick, and ſtics not, but lies ſtil, nor the flame of the fire, becauſe of its extream thinneſs and lightneſs, can enter into the hard ſubſtance of the Iron. Moreover, if the fire entred into the Subſtance of the Iron, when the Iron cools, the flame that went in ſhould come out again: but no man (he ſaies) did ever ſee fire fly or go out of a cooling Iron. Alſo (he ſaies) the latter is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe the ſubſtance of the Iron ſhould be turned into the ſubſtance of the Fire; which is falſe, becauſe the Iron remains Iron ſtil.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If the Iron became fire, it ſhould loſe its Heavineſs, Hardneſs, and Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtency.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, A Subſtance is a Beeing ſubſiſting by it ſelf, not exiſting in another thing, nor inhering in any thing as its ſubject. But the fire by it ſelf no where ſubſiſts, but is alwaies in ſome other thing, as in its ſubject, after the manner of accidents; and its ſubject taken away wherein it ſticks, there is no ſuch thing as Fire. <hi>Ergo</hi> it is an Accident.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly. Every Body of it ſelf hath Quantity: for Quantity ſprings from matter, and the determination thereof from the form: But Fire hath neither it ſelf any Quantity, nor hath it any determinate figure, but it hath only the Figure and Quantity of the ſubject wherein it inheres, as other accidents. Therefore it is no Body.</p>
                  <p>But this Error <hi>Julius Caeſar Scaliger</hi> long ſince obſerved and reſuted in <hi>Cardan, Exercit.</hi> 10. For nothing is accidentally in any thing, which is not eſſentially, primarily, and of it ſelf in ſome other; ſince every accident flows from a certain ſubſtance. And therefore ſince Heat is accidentally in the Iron, of neceſſity there muſt be a ſubſtance wherein it is primarily, and by which the Iron becomes hot: But ſuch there can be none but the Fire. And if fire be a Quality, its firſt and proper ſubject muſt be ſome ſubſtance. But thoſe reaſons where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Fienus</hi> was brought into that opinion are ſo ſlight, that I wonder ſo learned a man ſhould thereby be moved ſo to hold.</p>
                  <p>For, in the firſt place, we deny that the firineſs in the Wood, Iron, Furnace, Smoak, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives more and leſs. But that the fire ſomtimes burnes more, ſomtimes leſs, happens by reaſon of the application thereof to the Patient. For Virtue united is ſtronger, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Fire in a compact ſubſtance, as Iron, burnes more than in a thin ſubſtance, as Stubble or Straw.</p>
                  <p>To the ſecond I anſwer: That Smiths can tell that Iron is porous; and therefore the fire can eaſily inſinuate it ſelf thereinto. And whereas <hi>Fienus</hi> denies the Iron to have pores; that is contrary to ſenſe: for Smiths know how to diſtinguiſh the ſorts of Iron, and diſcern Iron from Steel by the variety of the pores. Nor is that of any moment which he further ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that if the fire were only in the pores of the Iron, the ſolid parts thereof ſhould not burn, nor would the Iron be light all over, many parts thereof would be dark. For indeed
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:35070:142"/>
                     <hi>Fienus</hi> was ignorant of the nature of the ſmall individual Bodikies or Atomes, nor did he conſider what dayly happens in Nature. For if Water can ſo penetrate into all the ſmalleſt parts of Wood, that there ſhall be no part thereof which is not moiſtened; Why may not the moiſt ſubtile fire much more pierce the Iron? And therefore to his third Argument we Anſwer, That the ſubſtance of the Fire doth certainly enter the Iron from without. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Coal it ſelf ſtir not, and enter not into the Iron; yet the fire which is in the coal exhales in ſmal Atomes, and inſinuates it ſelf into the Iron. And the thinneſs of the flame does not hinder the ſame, but rather help it to enter the hard ſubſtance of the Iron. And when the Iron cools again, then the fire exhales out of it; which though it be not diſcerned by our bodily eyes (for who can ſee the pure Elements of Fire and Air?) yet Philoſophers diſcern it ſufficiently by the effect.</p>
                  <p>To the fourth I anſwer, the Iron is not made Fire, but it receives the ſame. Which while it does, it loſes indeed its hardneſs and conſiſtency, ſo that it may be bent and beaten by the Hammer, yea, and it may be melted.</p>
                  <p>To the fift I ſay; It is falſe that Fire no where exiſts by it ſelf, but is alwaies in ſome other thing as a ſubject; which the ſenſe teaches.

                  <p>Moſt Meteors (truly) are no other than a maſs of Elementary Atomes variouſly congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated. For Exhalations and Vapors are not continued bodies, as is commonly thought,
<note place="margin">The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors are made of Atomes.</note> but crowds of infinite Atomes; which is manifeſt from the vapors ariſing from water which heats over the fire. For theſe though far off they ſeem to be a continued body, yet he which is neer at hand, or who walks on a Mountain top when the Air is miſty, may even diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern with his eyes that theſe vapors are not continued Bodies, but a throng of Atomes. A Cloud is nothing elſe but an infinite multitude of Atomes.
<note place="margin">A <hi>Cloud.</hi>
                     </note> For as when we ſee a ſmoak aſcend from burning Pitch or any other thing, we think afar off that it is a continued united body; but if we come neeter and diligently look upon the ſmoak, we ſee that it is no conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, no nor contiguous body neither; and ſo it is with Clouds, which until the ſmal bodies are again joyned together (which happens in Rain and Snow) they are no continued bodies, but many millions of millions of petty Atomes or ſmalleſt bodies. And Clouds as they are of divers kinds, ſo when they grow together again divers things are bred of them, as Rain, Snow, Hail, Winds, Lightnings, and other Meteors ſo called. Somtimes nevertheleſs the Atomes of Bodies perfectly mixed are mingled amongſt the Meteors.</p>
                  <p>For there are (in the ſecond place) Atomes of another kind beſides the Elementary (which if any man wil term firſt mixt bodies,
<note place="margin">The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond kind of Atomes.</note> he may do as he pleaſe) into which as ſimilar parts other compound bodies are reſolved. And indeed in the mixture of Natural things, or that which happens in lifeleſs things, theſe bodies of which the mixt things conſiſt are ſo broken and divided into ſmal particles, as that none of them can be diſcerned and known by it ſelf. Alſo in al fermentations and digeſtions and coctions, which are made by Nature or Art, nothing is done but to reduce things into their ſmalleſt parts, and unite them as neerly as may be. Contrariwiſe, the Reſolution of Natural Bodies, both that which is done by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that performed by Art, is nothing but the reſolving of them into their ſmalleſt parts or Atomes.</p>
                  <pb n="452" facs="tcp:35070:143"/>
                  <p> But Chymical Reſolutions do in a ſpecial manner diſcover that there are Atomes,
<note place="margin">Chymical Operations prove A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes.</note> and teach ſufficiently what little bodies there are. So Spirit of Wine pierces through writing paper four times double into the Alembick; and in Diſtillations and Sublimations ſuch Atomes are raiſed from Plants and Minerals into the Alembick or Recipient, many miſſions whereof nevertheleſs when they joyn together again do ſomtimes hardly make one drop or ſenſible quantity of Liquor. Nor let any man here perſwade himſelf when he ſets a vapor riſe out of water or Spirit of wine, or a Smoak ariſe out of Pitch, Sulphur, or burning wood, that theſe bodies are changed into Air; but the water, ſpirit of wine, and other bodies, are reſolved into the ſmalleſt Atomes, which when they joyn together again, they turn to water, ſpirit of wine, or ſome other body again; which the Alembicks of Chymiſts and their Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pients do teach. Alſo whiles ſpirit of Vitriol and other Spirits are diſtilled, the Recipient Veſſel is often ful of ſuch ſmal, but not yet ſmalleſt bodies for two or three daies together, and every moment ſome millions of ſuch bodies are preſent and follow one another. Yet a ſmal quantity of Liquor comes of them when they meet and are condenſed; ſo that thoſe Atomes which are preſent at the ſame moment, of which nevertheleſs there are ſome millions, do hardly conſtitute one drop. We ſee the ſame in other Reſolutions. If a man ſet on ſire a little bit of Pitch, and ſuppreſs the flame, an huge ſpace of Air is filled with the ſmoak thereof, which is no one continued body, but a multitude of little Atomes or ſmal bodies. And what difference there is betwixt a body compact and reſolved into Atomes, we may learn only by the putting out of a Candle. For if one blow out a burning Candle, the ſmoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Snuf, which is hardly ſo big as a Peaſe, does preſently ſend forth ſo great a quantity of Atomes that a great part of the Air is filled therewith. So flower of Brimſtone melts into Brimſtone; Mercury precipitate, or ſublimate, or however reſolved, does return again to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and running Quick-ſilver. So the water wherein Metal is diſſolved, although it ſeem cleer water, and is ſo exactly mixed that it wil paſs through a paper: yet the Metal preſerves its own nature therein entire, and is eaſily precipitated to the bottom in form of a moſt very fine pouder, which is afterwards melted into a Metal again. So alſo if one Maſs be made of Gold and Silver melted together, and they be ſo mingled in their ſmalleſt Atomes that no man would think them but one ſimple body; yet in the mean while in thoſe ſmalleſt Atomes each Metal preſerves its form and nature, and may be ſeparated by <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and reduced into its former Nature. Hence the cauſe of many Chymical Operations and things done in Chymiſtry may be rendred. If to Lead any way calcined you pour diſtilled Vinegar, the Lead is indeed diſſolved in the Vinegar, but the ſalt of the Vinegar unites its ſelf to the Lead, ſo that if it be drawn off by diſtilling, it comes away quite without taſt, the ſalt of the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar remaining with the Lead, whence comes that ſame ſweet mixt body which they cal <hi>Sac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charum Saturni,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> or Sugar of Lead. So if Crabs-eyes, Corals, Pearls, be diſſolved by Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar or other acid Liquors, and be reduced to pouder, ſo that they may be alſo ſtrained through a paper, and the ſalt of thoſe acid Liquors by reaſon of the ſimilitude joyns it ſelf with the bodies diſſolved (ſo that if it be diſtilled it cannot be ſeparated without much ado) yet if into the ſolution you drop Oyl of Tattar made by <hi>Deliquium,</hi> the ſalt of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar does by ſimilitude unite it ſelf to the ſalt of Vinegar, and the diſſolved Pearl or Coral is precipitated to the Bottom. So if to Quick-ſilver you pour Oyl of Vitriol or Sulphur, the Quick-ſilver is diſſolved in them, but the ſalt which is in thoſe Spirits is united to the Quick-ſilver, whence ariſes Mercury precipitate, which hath therefore ſuch a corroſive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. Of Quick-ſilver, Vitriol, Salt, is made <hi>Mercurius ſublimatus.</hi> Of Mercury and Sulphur ſublimed together, is made <hi>Cinnabaris.</hi> Thus Metals are reduced into pouder when being diſſolved in corroſive Liquors they are precipitated to the bottom. Yet they return and are reduced into their former Nature, that Body or Salt being taken away which they borrowed from the Solvent,
<note place="margin">Reduction.</note> which Operation is called Reduction. Which may be performed divers waies. Mercury precipitate if it be rubbed in a Mortar with Oyl of Tartar or Salt of Tartar diſſolved <hi>per deliquium,</hi> the Salt which cleaves to the Mercury is united to the Salt of Tartar, and forſakes the Mercury, whereupon it turns to Quick ſilver again. So, if Mercury ſublimate be mixed with Quicklime, and put into a Retort, the Salt of Vitriol, and the common Salt which is in the ſublimate, ſticks to the live or unſlak'd Lime, and ſo the Mercury returns to its former Nature, and becomes Quick-ſilver again. The Calces or Pouders of Metals are turned into molten Metals when the Salt mixed therewith is diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a ſtrong fire, yet it is done ſooner if ſome of thoſe Pouders they cal melting Pouders be mixed therewith. For the Salts of which thoſe meking Pouders are made do draw to them the Salt which adheres to the calcined Metal; from which when they are freed, the Aromes of the Metal by reaſon of ſimilitude unite themſelves, and ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="453" facs="tcp:35070:143"/>Body and ſhape. And indeed, how many external forms Bodies natural being mixed with others may put on (their ſubſtantial form remaining ſafe and ſound) even Mercury alone may teach us, which puts on ſo many external forms,
<note place="margin">Many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhap'd Mercury.</note> that it may be wel called Many-ſhap'd Mercury. 'Tis changed into a clear water, into a Liquor like Butter; 'tis ſublimated, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated, reduced into pouder, into Glaſs, the likeneſs of Lead, Gold, Silver, ſo that it may be wrought into Plates, and I know not how many forms beſides; al which nevertheleſs it laies down, if that which is mingled with it be therefrom ſeparated.</p>
                  <p>This Doctrine alſo of Atomes is manifeſtly confirmed by anointings with Mercury and Fumigations made thereof; wherein the Quick-ſilver being reduced into ſmal Atomes pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates the whol Body to the very jaws and mouth where it may be received by pieces of Gold held in the ſame. Yea, and it hath been found that after nointings with Mercury, Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver hath been collected in the Cavities of the Veins and Bones.</p>
                  <p>Yea, There are Atomes not only of inanimate Bodies, but alſo of ſome animate bodies:
<note place="margin">Atomes of Animate Bodies.</note> and the Soul it ſelf may ſomtimes luik and preſerve it ſelf in ſuch ſmal bodies; as we ſhal hereafter ſhew when we treat of the Spontaneous Original of living things; and upon this Doctrine of Atorues the moſt learned <hi>Fortunius Licetus</hi> hath built in a manner al his Treatiſe of the Spontaneous Original of live things. Of which we ſhal ſpeak in its place.</p>
                  <p>Plants (truly) do manifeſtly declare that there are Atomes.
<note place="margin">The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes of Plants.</note> For who would beleeve that in cleer and tranſparent Wine there were a ſtony ſubſtance, unleſs it appeared by ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whiles the Tartar ſeparated from the Wine ſticks to the ſides of the Veſſels? And matter unfit to nouriſh the body being thruſt into the joynts ſtirs up arthritick pains, and there at length it grows into a kind of ſtoney ſubſtance. The Generation alſo of other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes ſhews the ſame: For ſeeing many ſuperfluous things unfit to nouriſh are taken in with our meat, they though they are bitter, and ſowr, and ſalt, and otherwiſe pomaint, ſtrong and different; yet (as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaies, <hi>de Priſca Medicina</hi>) being mixed and mutually tempered together they are neither perceived, nor do they hurt a man: but when any of them is ſeparated and by it ſelf, then it becomes apparent, and troubles a Man.</p>
                  <p>Alſo the Atomes of Purging Medicaments do make the Milk purging,
<note place="margin">The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes of purgatives</note> as alſo <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaies in 6. <hi>Epidem. com.</hi> 5. <hi>text.</hi> 33. If a woman or a ſhe Goat eat Elaterium or the wild Cucumer, their yong ones are purged. For although as we have alſo ſaid in our <hi>tr. de Diſſenſ. chymicor. cum Ariſtotelic. &amp; Galen.</hi> a purging Plant eaten by a ſhee Goat is digeſted in her ſtomach, and mingled with the Chyle, that Chyle is turned to Blood, that Blood in the Goats Dugs becomes Milk, this Milk is drunk by the Nurſe, and there are ſo many muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: yet in all theſe the Atomes of the purging Plants remain intire, and keep their Vertues.</p>
                  <p>Milk alſo it ſelf, though it ſeem but one body, yet the Whey, Butter, and Cheeſe do ſhew being ſeparated, that there were divers ſmal Bodies mingled together therein. So the Blood of Animals, although it ſeems to be one homogeneal Body, there are nevertheleſs therein not only divers parts which afford nouriſhment to different Members; but alſo if it be diſtilled, Volatile Salt which before did not ſhew it ſelf ſticks in great quantity to the Receiver. Which alſo happens if the Horns and Bones of Animals be diſtilled.</p>
                  <p>Yea, and the conſideration of whol entire Animals may bring us to the knowledg of Atomes. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the 5. <hi>Hiſtor. Animal. cap.</hi> 3. writes that in old Wax and in Wood a certain Animal is bred (which is the leaſt of al living things) called <hi>Acari.</hi> There are alſo a ſort of Lice called <hi>Sirones,</hi> ſo ſmal that they cannot be ſeen but by a ſharp ſight, and in an augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Glaſs. Yet theſe are Animals, <hi>ergo</hi> they have an animal, motive, nutritive, and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive faculty in an Organical Body made up of very many Organs. They draw, concoct, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilate their nouriſhment, and are moved. They have therefore animal Spirits, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, which are themſelves alſo bodies; they have Organs wherein they are generated, and wherein they are contained. And al theſe again if we divide them into their firſt and ſmalleſt Atomes or bodies, how many thouſand parts wil they make? and if the little Creature Acari, or a ſmal Louſe, be divided into ſo many thouſand parts, how very exceeding little muſt thoſe parts be?</p>
                  <p>And although thoſe Atomes be ſo exceeding ſmal;
<note place="margin">Atomes retain the forms of things.</note> yet the eſſential forms of things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in them entire, as was lately ſaid, and experience it ſelf does witneſs. For if Gold and Silver be melted together, the Atomes of the Gold and Silver are ſo mingled in their ſmalleſt parts, that no ſenſe can diſcern the one from the other. Yet both of them do retain their forms entire. Which appears hereby in that if you put <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> upon the ſaid
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:35070:144"/>Maſs, the Silver melts and turns into the Liquor, but the Gold remains in form of a Pouder. If the diſſolved Silver be precipitate it ſettles to the bottom in form of a moſt delicate fine Pouder. Each of theſe Pouders molten by themſelves do return into their former ſhapes of Gold and Silver. So if Quick-ſilver be ſublimed, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated, turned to water, and undergo other changes, according to the various mixture of the Atomes whereinto it is reſolved with other things; yet it alwaies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains its own eſſential form, is eaſily ſeparated from the Bodies wherewith it is mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and returns into its old ſhape of running Quick-ſilver. Nor does this betide in Metals only, but alſo in Vegetables or Plants. For when diſtilled Waters and Spirits are made by Chymiſts, inſenſible Atomes ariſe out of the Plants, ſo that in the <hi>Cucurbita</hi> they cannot any waies be diſcerned; but when they joyn together in the Alembick, and turn to Liquor, they again ſhew themſelves in their likeneſs, whiles one is Spirit of Wine, another of Juniper, &amp;c. And if a Goat be nouriſhed with certain purgative Herbs, and a Nurſe drink the Milk of the Goat, it wil purge the Infant which ſucks that Nurſes Milk; as was ſaid before out of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> 6. <hi>Epidem. com.</hi> 5. <hi>text.</hi> 33.</p>
                  <p>That moſt learned Peripatetick <hi>Jacobus Schegkius</hi> acknowledged the truth of this thing, when in <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Occult. Medic. facult. cap.</hi> 1. he thus wrote, <hi>The beating of a thing into a moſt fine pouder does not neceſſarily corrupt the ſubſtance thereof, ſeeing it is an accident of an accident for that which is continual to be divided into very ſmal bodies.</hi> And a little after; <hi>It does not follow that the ſubſtance is aboliſhed, if a man ſhall ſay that Medicaments beaten into pouder are effectual in our bodies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Howbeit,
<note place="margin">Atomes are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate.</note> Atomes have their Laws from Nature, and doubtleſs the Atomes of Fire are more ſubtile than thoſe of Earth, although we cannot difcern ſo much. For ſo the caſe ſtands with Natural things that the forms conſiſt not ſave in a certain quantity; and as they diffuſe not themſelves beyond their Natural bounds; ſo they cannot be conſerved ſave in a certain quantity. This alſo <hi>Franciſcus Agui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius</hi> obſerved, who in the 5. B. of his Opticks, Propoſit. 8. declared this thing in the example of Light, when he wrote; Though there is not a ſmalleſt in quantity, yet Light hath a ſmalleſt in Nature,
<note place="margin">Things ſmalleſt in Nature.</note> that is to ſay, ſo ſmal a Light that it cannot be ſmaller without periſhing. After which manner there are alſo the ſmalleſt among Natural Bodies; which if they be any more divided they loſe their form and eſſence. For as Bodies towards their natural ſubſiſtency do require ſome bulk of quantity, which is nothing but the meaſure of corporeal ſubſtance; even ſo Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties alſo (unleſs they be in ſome degree of excellency) they periſh of their own accord. And in Propoſ. 15. We affirm that Light cannot of its own ſtrength and by it ſelf exiſt ſolitarily in any degree whatſoever, but that there is a certain limit of ſmalneſs, beyond which we cannot proceed by dividing without the deſtruction thereof, which therefore we may not unfitly cal the <hi>minimum naturale</hi> of Light: but if it be joyned to a greater Light, although it be ſmal, nothing hinders but by help thereof it may be ſuſtained, provided both together do at leaſt attain to the <hi>minimum naturale,</hi> or ſmalleſt natural quantity of Light. Moreover, this imbecilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſubſiſting is not proper to theſe Qualities alone, which admit the diverſity of greater and leſſer, but alſo common to al Bodies which vary their magnitude. For as theſe without ſome bulk, ſo they without ſome degree of excellency cannot free themſelves from deſtruction. For being attenuated beyond their ſtrength they fal to nothing and periſh, no contrary thing deſtroying them, but only through defect of that meaſure, which being an indiſpenſable Law of Nature, is requiſite to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per maintenance of each one. But what he ſaies of Qualities may be ſaid much more of Forms from which the Qualities flow.</p>
                  <p>Now thoſe diſputes againſt Atomes concerning the infinite diviſion of that which is continued of indiviſible Lines, are diſputed not from Natural but Mathematical Principles. For the Queſtion is not here (as was ſaid before) Whether a thing continued be perpetually diviſible Mathematically? but, Whether or no Nature in her Generation and reſolution of Bodies does not ſtop at ſome ſmalleſt Bodies, than which there are not, nor can be any ſmaller.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>SInce the Doctrine of Mixture is exceeding neceſſary rightly to underſtand the Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of al Natural Things, and the Foundation wel-neer of al Natural Philoſophy; it is worth our Labor duly to explain the ſame. Which that we may the better do, we are to know in the firſt place that the term <hi>Mixture</hi> hath ſundry acceptations.
<note place="margin">Mixture what it ſignifies.</note> For (as <hi>Thomas Eraſtus, Diſput.</hi> 2. <hi>Contra Paracelſ. part</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 195. writes) ſomtimes it ſignifies an Heap and Maſs of things blended together, as of Rye, Wheat, and other ſuch like things which keep their ſurface and Integrity. Somtimes it ſignifies the compoſition of two or three, or more Bodies, ſo confuſed together, that though each retain its own Nature, and they may be ſeparated again, yet one Body is made up of al. Such is <hi>Crama,</hi> which is made of Wine and Water mixed; which is not one in Form, but in continuation only. For although nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Wine nor the Water be ſeparable by their bounds, yet they are both ſo contained under their Natural Form as Gold is in Silver, which may be ſeparated by <hi>Aqua fortis.</hi> Such a Body is Honey and Wine, Honey and Water, and infinite others compounded by Art. Thirdly, it is taken for a Body compounded of divers things, ſo that of all one thing is made, of a different Nature from al the Ingredients, and having a form quite different from their forms. And things ſo mixed are truly ſaid to be mixt bodies. The firſt mannet (ſince there in no real mixture is made, but dry things are only blended together, which makes no difficulty in our minds) <hi>Julius Caeſar Scaliger</hi> omits, and propounds other three, <hi>Exercitat.</hi> 101. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. There are (ſaith he) three Manners, Degrees, or Sorts of Mixture. The firſt is of thoſe things which after they are blended may again be ſeparated; as a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of water and wine. For <hi>Pliny</hi> reports they are ſeparated with Veſſels of Ivy as he had it from <hi>Cato;</hi> and we do it with a cloth. The other manner is as it happens in thoſe bodies natural which we cal imperfectly mixed, of which there are two degrees: The other more weak, as of a Cloud, Rain, Wind, Hail, Snow, Dew, Hoar-froaſt, and ſuch like. For they are exhalations mixt of divers Elements which may eaſily be diſſolved. But they hang together more cloſely than thoſe of the firſt ſort. The other degree is of a firmer union; as in clods of Earth and ſtones. For the parts of theſe are not eaſily ſeparated one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Yet they cal them rather mixt Bodies than by any other nobler Appellation, becauſe they ſeem to them to be things only begun. The third Mixture is of ſuch things as ſome are pleaſed after a peculiar manner to term Mixt Bodies. Such are Vegetable and Senſitive things.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning theſe three Manners, the Queſtion is, Whether they are in al mixt bodies made after one and the ſame manner.
<note place="margin">What mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it.</note> Which that we may rightly unfold we muſt know in the firſt place what Mixture is. Now <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> defines it to be the Union of things mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able after they are altered. And <hi>Scaliger</hi> in the place fore-alleadged; That it is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Atomes or ſmalleſt Particles of Bodies to a mutual Contact, ſo as they may become one. And he further explains his meaning, and that rightly, how that every thing that is, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> one, not only by continuation and privation of pure contiguity, but by act alſo, by vertue whereof it comes to paſs that thoſe parts become one body. Now by Act he means the Form, by which it comes to paſs that thoſe parts which by their own nature and aptitude might come together to an Union, are become actually one. And he concludes rightly, That thoſe things which are not one Beeing formally, but by accident only (as an Heap of Beans and Oats blended is one) are not properly mixtbodies, nor ought ſo to be called, but things jumbled, as Wine and Water, Silver and Gold; ſince ſuch things are not formally one, but ſo many things as there are parts within and without, and only one by accident; which though it be leſs manifeſt to the ſenſes, yet is it not hid to the underſtanding of wiſe Men; ſeeing they may eaſily be ſeparated, as Wine and Water by Ivy Veſſels, and by cloaths; and Silver and Gold by <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> ſo called.</p>
                  <p>But by al that hath been ſaid the difficulty is not quite removed, nor the Nature of Mixture ſufficiently explained; but two knots do remain as yet to be untied, which being rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded they bring great Light to Natural Philoſophy and Phyſick. For although we muſt needs grant, that nothing is truly mixed but what is formally one; yet the queſtion ſtill remains: Firſt, Whether it be neceſſary that the mixable bodies which are united by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of oue Form, and grow together into one mixed Body, ſhould loſe their own Forms? or, Whether in the mixed body they may al under another form retain their own forms ſtil? Secondly, Whether the Elements only are mixable, and every reſolution into the ſmalleſt
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:35070:145"/>particles made in reference to Mixture does alwaies proceed ſo far as to the Elements? or whether other bodies more noble than the Elements may properly be ſaid to be mixed? Both which Queſtions muſt be explained.</p>

                        </gap>ms?</note> That the ſame may be rightly explained, we wil only enquire concerning the Elements. For concerning them there is no doubt but that they are rightly mixed; but as touching other Bodies the matter is queſtionable. But whatſoever ſhal be ſaid of the Elements, that hath alſo undoubtedly place in al other mixable bodies. Now there are chiefly two Opinions concerning Mixture; the one held by well-nigh al the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents before <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> as <hi>Empedocles, Democritus, Anaxagoras, Hippocrates,</hi> yea, and by very many Philoſophers ſince <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who al held that Generation and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are made by the Conjunction and Separation of Atomes, and that the Bodies mixed do retain their forms entire in the thing made up of them. Which manifeſtly appears out of <hi>Hippocrates, Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Victus ratione,</hi> where he writes: <hi>What I mean by Generation and Corruption I muſt explain for the ſakes of many, viz. To be mixed and ſeparated. Now thus the matter ſtands: To be generated, and to be mingled are all one, and to be ſeparated and corrupted are all one.</hi> According to whoſe mind, as I ſaid before, <hi>Jul. Caeſar Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Exercit.</hi> 101. defines Mixtion; That it is the motion of Atomes to the mutual contact one of another, that they may be united. The other is the Definition of <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> For he only ſeparated from the Ancients in this point. For thus in the 1. <hi>de Gener. &amp; cor. cap.</hi> 10. he writes againſt <hi>Empedocles: We muſt not ſay, That ſuch things as are mixed are mingled by their ſmal parts, which ſtill retain their own nature. For that would be a compoſition, but not a temperature or mixture, nor would the part be of the ſame nature with the whol. We ſay, That if a thing be mixt the parts thereof are one like another, even as every part of water is water. But if mixture be a compoſition according to the ſmal parts, none of theſe things does happen, but that is only a mixture ſo appearing to the ſenſe, and that which a dim-ſighted man will account mixed, a quick ſighted man will diſcern not to be mixed.</hi> He teaches the ſame in the 2. <hi>de generat. &amp; corrupt. cap.</hi> 7. <hi>pag.</hi> 47. the ſenſe of which place <hi>Toletus</hi> thus propounds: <hi>He reproves this manner of mixture</hi> (which <hi>Empedocles</hi> ſuppoſed) <hi>becauſe one inconvenience follows,</hi> viz. <hi>That out of every part of the mixt body the four Elements could not be extracted, and ſo every part of the mixt body is not mixed: the Conſequence is cleared, becauſe as out of every part of a wall cannot be taken ſtones and bricks, becauſe where the one is, the other is not: ſo truly it will be in a mixt body, which is made after the ſame manner of the Elements.</hi> And thus indeed <hi>Ariſiotle</hi> oppoſes the Opinion of the Ancients; but he ſo propounded his own Opinion that hitherto for ſo many Ages there hath been Civil War amongſt his Expoſitors, what his Opinion was, or how it is to be explained; whiles ſome (as <hi>Averrhoes</hi>) do hold that as wel the ſubſtantial Forms as the Qualities of the Elements do remain actually in the body mixed, only broken, allaied, and reduced to a mediocrity. Others (as <hi>Scotus</hi>) do teach that the forms and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Elements do quite periſh in the mixture, and that a new form of the mixt body is generated, and a new quality, which is the temperature of the mixt body. Others (as moſt of the Latins) do conceive, That the forms of the Elements are no waies preſerved in the mixt body, neither entire nor broken, yet they hold the Qualities remain in the mixt body, but broken and reduced to a mediocrity. Whoſe contentions to ſet down in this place is no part of my buſineſs. They may be read in <hi>Zabarella</hi> his Book of Mixture, in <hi>Tolet.

And eſpecially <hi>Avicenna</hi> comes up directly to the mind of the Ancients, and holds, That the Elements in mixt Bodies do retain their Forms perfect and entire, howbeit divided and cut into very ſmal parts, ſo that their particles compoſed and knit together in a certain order do mutually cohere one with another. <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> follows <hi>Avicenna,</hi> who <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Phyſiolog. cap.</hi> 6. cals the Opinion of thoſe that hold the contrary, a childiſh and vain, nay, a monſtrous Opinion; and he judges that thoſe who ſo think have contemned the Philoſophy of the Ancients. And they do indeed al of them wel, in that they adhere firmly to the Opinion of the Ancients, being moved thereto by moſt firm Reaſons: but herein they take pains to no purpoſe, whiles they would make
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:35070:145"/>this to have been the Opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> ſince <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in expreſs words relinquiſhes the Ancients in their Opinion, as appears in that place lately alleadged. Yea, and very many others who differ from the Ancients ſaw this Truth, and nothing but the Authority of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hindred them from imbracing the ſame; and if the Authority of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> be ſet aſide, and the point debated only by reaſon, and no vain labor beſtowed how to reconcile this Doctrine with <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s words, that is, Truth with Falſhood, the caſe is very plain. Yea, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf comes to this Opinion againſt his wil, whiles at the end of his 1. Book <hi>de Ortu &amp; Interitu,</hi> he defines Mixture to be the Union of things mixable, being alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. For when he ſaies the Union of things altered, he intimates that the things mixed do not periſh, but remain in the body mixed. For if they are altered and mixed they do not perith. Nor does the word Union oppoſe this Opinion, as <hi>Zabarella</hi> conceits in <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>de Miſt.</hi> but rather confirms the ſame. For Union is the Copulation of ſuch things as have a real Being, but not of things that periſh. And although of many things one be made: yet neither is it neceſſary that thoſe ſimples ſhould periſh, nor is it a meer aggregation or blen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but the ſimples by a ſuperior form are reduced into one body. And this Doctrine of the Ancients, viz. That the Elements and ſimple Bodies do keep their natures entire in the Compounds, is the key (in a manner) to al Natural Philoſophy, and the greateſt part of Chymiſtry and Phyſick.</p>
                  <p>Contrariwiſe, That only Opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> That the Simples do not retain their Natures in mixt Bodies, hath caſt the Expoſitors of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> into Labyrinths and inextrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Controverſies, and hath been brought into Natural Philoſophy to the great dammage of Phyſick; which being rejected all things become plain and eaſie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Arguments for this Opinion.</note> The ancient Philoſophers, and late Authors which follow them, have been induced to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace this Opinion by very ſtrong reaſons. For firſt of al, the Nature of Mixture ſhews as much, ſince <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ings that periſh cannot be ſaid to be mixed: which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf in the end of <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Ortu &amp; Interitu</hi> acknowledges. Nor could he do otherwiſe. For ſince (as in <hi>Metaph. Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>text.</hi> 3.) he declares, That Elements are that of which exiſting things conſiſt; it muſt needs be that theſe Elements (if they were Elements) muſt abide and exiſt in the mixt Body.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, Since Action preſuppoſes Act, and in mixt bodies the actions of the Elements are apparent; of neceſſity they muſt be actually in them. Not to ſpeak of others, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hunſelf, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Caelo,</hi> writes, That a mixt Body is moved according to the ſway of the prevailing Element.</p>
                  <p>Finally, The Reſolution of mixt Bodies into their Elements ſhews the ſame. For mixt bodies are reſolved into the Elements; and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf in 1. <hi>de generat. &amp; corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text.</hi> 84. ſaies, That the things mixable may be ſeparated again from the mixt body. And if ſo, then were they actually in the mixed body.</p>
                  <p>The force of which Argument is ſuch, That thoſe who have labored to anſwer the ſame, have ſhamefully foiled themſelves. For the Conimbricenſian Collegiates, while they deny that while Woods are burnt they are reſolved into the four Elements, and deny that the water which drops out of the ſaid wood, and diſtilled waters, are true water, they reſiſt not only <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf, and other Peripateticks, but alſo their very Senſes. For ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that Liquor which drops out of burning Wood, or from an Alembick, is not pure wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: yet our Senſes, and the ſeparation which is eaſily made, do witneſs that the greateſt part thereof is water. And after this reckoning there ſhould be no Element of Water in the whol World; ſince it is no where ſound pure. But others leſt they ſhould go againſt their own Senſes, do indeed grant that mixt bodies are reſolved into the Elements, but they foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly hold, that not the ſame Elements in number, but only the ſame ſort of Elements come out of the mixt body; which is founded upon no reaſon, but is only hatched to palliate an abſurd Opinion, yea, and it is repugnant to Reaſon and Experience. For when they hold that Elements return out of the mixt body by reaſon of the action of a like Element, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they recover what they loſt in the mixture; how I pray you, in diſtillations and burnings can Water and Earth be excracted out of the Compound? ſince Fire by acting upon the mixt body introduces nothing that is watry or earthy, yea, the action of fire is adverſe to water and earth, ſo far is it from augmenting or perfecting the ſame. The only agent in combuſtions is fire: and the force thereof equally affects al the parts of the mixt body, and yet nevertheleſs it brings out ſome bot, others cold, others moiſt, others dry, others bitter, others ſweet, others other waies differing: which ſince they cannot proceed from one only action of fire, verily we muſt believe they were before in the mixt body.</p>
                  <pb n="458" facs="tcp:35070:146"/>
                  <p> And which way ſoever they turn themſelves who hold the contrary Opinion, yet they can no waies diſ-intangle themſelves. For either the Form remains in the mixt body, or it does not remain. If it remain, it remains either entire, or broken.</p>
                  <p>He who holds they remain intire, conſents with the Ancients. But <hi>Averrhoes</hi> and <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barella</hi> hold they remain broken. But what they bring concerning the Refraction or breaking of the Forms, is a meer figment; and their Opinion who hold the forms of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are capable of more or leſs are ſufficiently refuted from the Latins diſputing againſt the Opinion of <hi>Averrhoes;</hi> nor have they ever brought any ſo much as a probable reaſon for their Opinion, but have only ſimply and barely affirmed, that Forms have certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, ſome of which may be taken away, and the reſt remain. For the whol Nature of the Form conſiſts in that which cannot be divided, nor does any Form receive more or leſs, but where ever it is, either it is totally there, or not at al.</p>
                  <p>But they which hold the Forms do not remain in the Body mixed, and that nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains but the matter, are very abſurd and almoſt ridiculous. For what mixture is there where nothing remains? For ſince the Elements have no other matter than the firſt, and the firſt matter is common to al the Elements, I cannot ſay that one mixt body hath more fire than air. For whatſoever is, is by its form. And therefore if the Elements are not in the mixt body by their form, they are not there at al. And thus a mixt Body in reſpect of the Elements ſhould be as ſimple as the Elements themſelves; becauſe although the matter be from the four Elements; yet becauſe the Matter of Fire, Air, Water, Earth, does not differ, and the Form (according to their Opinion) of Fire, Air, Water, Earth, ſhould be no longer preſent, the mixt body ſo called muſt needs be ſimple.</p>
                  <p>And that we may alſo conſider what is wont to be objected to the contrary; if any ſhal ask, What were the Motives which cauſed <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> to forſake the Opinion of the Ancients commonly held in his time, we cannot find any of moment, ſave that which he chiefly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds, in 1. <hi>de Generat. &amp; Corrupt. cap.</hi> 7. and that is this: That he conceives from the Opinion of the Ancients this abſurdity follows, That every part of a mixt body ſhould not be mixed, and that out of every part of a mixt body the four Elements could not be extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. But the Ancients wil anſwer, That this ought not to be done, and that this is <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi>'s Hypotheſis, and that he laies that as a Foundation which is the matter in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie. For this Aſſertion ſeems contrary to the nature of mixture. For if there be a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, thoſe things which are mingled muſt needs be ſimples. Nor is it neceſſary that thoſe Simples ſhould be mixed, but at laſt in the reſolution we muſt of neceſſity come to Simples.</p>
                  <p>Others alſo do ad other Reaſons. <hi>Scaliger, Exercit.</hi> 16. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. The Forms remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (ſaies he) mixture (according to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) ſhould be but an heap; as it is in dry bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. For the Natural Quantity of every ſmal part follows the exiſtence thereof, but not continuation, for ſo ſhould they be really the Atomes of <hi>Democritus.</hi> But <hi>Scaliger</hi> whiles he regards ſomtimes truth, other whiles Authority, contradicts himſelf, and anſwers this Argument, <hi>Exercit.</hi> 101. while he writes; That theſe parts retain their forms, but loſe the preſcription of their bounds, and ſo they are not a meer heap, but do make a mixt body. For that is falſe which ſome object, That things of different ſorts cannot be continued. For whiles the Elements are united under the Dominion of one Form, they are really continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Nor is it abſurd (as the ſame <hi>Scaliger</hi> writes in the ſame place) to hold that there are many forms in one continued body. For theſe forms are every one the act of its own Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Which matters becauſe they are by Nature ordained to a more labored compoſition, ſhe hath provided that their forms as wel as themſelves ſhould be mixed. But the ultimate and moſt excellent forms, as of a man, ſince they are not ordained for any further work, they only are not mixed.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, Neither is this of any great moment which ſome object; If the Elements ſhould remain perfect under the dominion of another Form, it would follow that the Form of the mixt Body ſhould be an accident; ſince what is added to a perfect Being actually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted is an accident. For the anſwer is manifeſt from what hath been anſwered to the former Objection. For as <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaies there, thoſe leſs noble Elements and Mixables are made for the ſake of the more noble, and therefore ſubmit themſelves to the Rule of the more noble form, which ſuparvening obtains the Office, not of an accident, but of a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Form. But thoſe things only which are added to thoſe more noble bodies, which are not ordained for any further compoſition, are accidents.</p>
                  <p>Now that many have not been able to attain the truth in this point,
<note place="margin">The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal cauſe of mixture</note> and have erred in a matter plain enough, the chief cauſe is, That they knew not the true and principal Cauſe of
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:35070:146"/>mixture, and thought that al ſorts of Natural Bodies did proceed only from the mutual fight of the Elements, and their mutual action one upon another; and to uſe the words of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> himſelf, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Generat. &amp; Corrupt. Cap.</hi> 9. <hi>text.</hi> 54. they attributed powers and vertues to Bodies (by which they generate moſt inſtrumentally) neglecting the cauſe taken from the Form. But the fole concourſe of Elements makes very few ſorts of natural things, and none of thoſe more perfect Bodies: and contrary to the mind of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> the Expoſitors father upon him, that he brings the Generation of Natural Bodies only from the Elements. For he expreſly holds (as was ſaid before, 2. <hi>de generat. &amp; corrupt. text.</hi> 40.53. <hi>&amp; ſequent.</hi>) that the Qualities of the Elements are only Inſtruments, and the principal Cauſe is the ſpecifick form of every thing. The ſame thing <hi>Scaliger</hi> teaches, <hi>Exercit.</hi> 307. <hi>Sect.</hi> 20. Unleſs (ſaies he) the four Elements have a Governor, they wil vainly toſs and be toſſed. For what is it that ſhal mix ſo much Earth with the reſt? And there ought to be in every motion one firſt Mover. For they cannot move themſelves to any work, but in Compounds they are moved to mutual connexion by a more excellent Form, in bodies im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly mixed by an external principle. <hi>Eraſtus</hi> was forced to acknowledg the ſame,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of</hi> Eraſtus <hi>touching the Cauſe of Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
                     </note> who although in his Diſputations againſt <hi>Paracelſus</hi> he writes, <hi>Parte altera, pag.</hi> 196. that there are no qualities in the whol world which can change whol Bodies applied to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides heat and cold, moiſture and drineſs (and that therefore theſe Qualities muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be held the Principle of Mixtures) yet compelled by the evidence of the thing it ſelf he ads by and by: we do not ſay that they are principles in ſuch a ſenſe, as if we held them to be the principal Cauſes, but we ſay they are Inſtruments without which no form can make a mixture. But being further demanded, What that form is which is the worker of mixtures? he anſwers, It is the Divine Command whereby in the Creation God commanded the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that they ſhould orderly meet together for the Generation of things; and that the Motion of the Heavens gives no ſmal aſſiſtance thereto. But this anſwer is partly from the purpoſe, partly falſe. For the Queſtion is not about the firſt Cauſe of things, but the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Cauſe. Nor is it yet proved that God gave this Command to the Elements, but it is the Office of the Form to marſhal the Elements in a mixt body. And although God created al things, and theſe lower Bodies are ſubject to the motions and influx of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens; yet God hath given Nature, by which al things are generated, which is the form of every thing, and the Soul of things animate. It ſhapes it ſelf its own body,
<note place="margin">Mixture how it is made.</note> and for the making thereof draws Elements and other Bodies, diſpoſes, unites and governs them; whence it follows that they are now formally one, and being united under that which is actually one they become themſelves actually one which before were many. And therefore the Elements do not concur of themſelves, but are drawn by the Forms. Whereof <hi>Scaliger</hi> writes excellently in 1. <hi>de Plantis: The Soul</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>is Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to a living thing. She ſhapes for her ſelf Hoofs, Teeth, Horns to defend life:
<note place="margin">Nature the Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid of God.</note> and therefore ſhe uſes them, and knows how to uſe them, without any object or any phantaſie. He that made the Soul gave certain precepts thereto, partly general, partly ſpecial. Thoſe are ſuch as pertain to her preſerving her union with the Body: of which there was to be no outward Author. Careful therefore hereof ſhe moves the Heart, concocts in the Stomach, concocts again in the Liver, perfects the nouriſhment in the Veins, digeſts in the Members, changes it into the ſubſtance of the Body, bears it, unites it, reſtores it, repairs it.</hi> Yea, he ſpeaks Divinely in his 2. <hi>de Plantis: That</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>which is heavy, alſo aſcends: For that work is performed by the diſtributing faculty, which alſo lifts the Earth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and drives or draws the air downwards; being Lady of the Fire and Air, by the firſt Command of its Creator. For I doubt not but you hold that there was not one Spirit-maker of all things, and another the Preſerver of them when made; nor that be which made all things of himſelf, and cannot be abſent from himſelf, can be abſent from the things he hath made. God, God, my good friends, neither idle, nor buſied,
<note place="margin">All things from God.</note> neither in work nor out of work; but without work, the Head, Beginning, Middle, End, and all of the Work, and that I may in one word diſpatch, compaſs in, and ſurmount all, He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who by his moſt ſimple and indiviſible <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding of himſelf made the World; wherely all have attained their End and Order.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Zabarella</hi> alſo ſaw the ſame Truth in part; but he could not reach the whol,
<note place="margin">The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of a living and life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs mixt Body does differ.</note> being hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by a pre-conceived Opinion, whiles in his 1. <hi>de miſt. Generat. &amp; Interitu, cap.</hi> 2. he diſtinguiſhes betwixt the generation of a mixt animated body and an inanimate, and ſaies rightly, That a living Creature is not generated by the Elementary Vertue, but by Vital Heat implanted in the ſeed, ſo that in the generation of a living thing al the Qualities of the Elements are inſtead of matter, and the immediate Agent is the Vital Heat implanted in the Seed, being proportionable to the Element of the Stars.</p>
                  <pb n="460" facs="tcp:35070:147"/>
                  <p> But whereas he ſaies that a mixt Body as ſuch is generated by Elementary heat tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by cold as the prime Worker, working upon the two paſſive Qualities as Matter; that is liable to many difficulties. I ſay rather, hardly any perfectly mixt body is generated af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that manner as <hi>Zabarella</hi> ſuppoſes, and that there is no ſuch mixt thing in Nature. For what (as was lately alleadged out of <hi>Scaliger, Exercitat.</hi> 307. <hi>Sect.</hi> 20.) ſhould thus col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect certain portions of Elements, and what ſhould mingle ſo much Earth with ſo much Water? Nor is there any reaſon to fly to the fire in this caſe, whereof <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſpeaks in his ſecond <hi>de Plantis:</hi> If the Fire unites the three other Elements as parts, what ſhal unite it to the three? But moſt likely it is, that al perfectly mixt things are either parts of an animated Body, or ſorts of Natural bodies made in the firſt Creation, which either yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſuch in the Individuals, or are continued by a new Generation; whereof <hi>Scaliger</hi> moſt rightly in the ſame Exercitet. ſaies, That every Form of every perfectly mixt body, although it be not a Soul, as that of an Adamant, is a ſift Eſſence far different from the four Elements. For this form in Gold, Silver, and other Metals, in Jewels and Stones, aptly diſpoſes the Elements and ſuch matter as is ſit for it ſelf. From which it eaſily appears, that what is by <hi>Zabarella</hi> objected, <hi>de Miſtione, cap.</hi> 9. is of no moment; where he writes, If in Mixture there were made a reſolution into the ſmalleſt parts natural, there muſt alwaies be equal portions of the mixable Ingredients, or they muſt hold the ſame proportion one to another. For this is no waies neceſſary; but the Elements concur in an unequal and moſt divers proportion, according as the Conſtitution of the mixt body requires, or as the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is directed by the ſuperior Form. For a Gourd and a Cowcumber draw more Water and leſs Fire; and a Pitch-Tree, a Pine-Tree, and a Fir, draw more Fire and leſs Water.</p>
                  <p>Moreover,
<note place="margin">Whether a fight of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is requiſite in Mixture?</note> This alſo was no ſmal Cauſe (which yet agrees almoſt with the former) why many erred from the Truth, becauſe they ſuppoſed that the Elements did no otherwiſe concur to Mixture than by their ſighting one with another. For ſeeing mixt bodies conſiſt of contraries, and contraries do mutually fly one another; that they may concur and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agree to make up a mixt body, ſome have thought that this friendſhip and agreement could not be procured unleſs by ſight foregoing they were reduced to a mediocrity. Which agreement of the Elements how it ſhould be made they are at variance amongſt themſelves, whiles ſome hold that it is ſufficient that their firſt qualities be abated, though the forms re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main intire; others conceiving that both the forms and the qualities were remitted and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. But there is ſimply no need of this fight; it is ſufficient if they be reduced into Atomes. For then it is that things contrary do fight together and ſhun one another, when notable magnitudes and portions of them do concur. But when they are reduced into their ſmalleſt Particles or Atomes, there is either none at al, or no conſiderable Skirmiſh. Which thing is apparent by many experiments. When water is poured upon burning coals, a noiſe intailed by the fight of thoſe Contraries; but not when the fiery Atomes are mingled with the Water, while the Water heats and is turned into vapors; where by the confeſſion of al men the Atomes both of Water and Fire are contained in the Vapors, and keep the peace. So alſo, if water be gently heated, it receives the fiery Atomes without any fighting: but if the water grow exceeding hot, and the fiery Atomes come thronging into the Water, or particles of fire bigger than atomes, there is fighting, and great bubbling and boyling. But when the water is reſolved into vapors and ſmalleſt atomes, although it be joyned with atomes of fire, yet no fight is obſerved. Oyl admits no Water, nor is mixed therewith, by reaſon of the contrariety of its Nature. Yet if Oyl be reduced into Atomes it wil admit Water. For examples ſake, diſtilled Oyls do ſwim upon Wine and diſtilled Waters, and mix not therewith; but if thoſe Oyls be firſt mixed with Sugar, and the Sugar afterwards diſſolved in Wine or Water, the Water receives the Oyl being reduced into ſmal atomes, and thereby a Medicinal Wine or Water is made, having the ſmel, taſt, and vertues of the ſaid Oyl. After the ſame manner in the diſſolving of Pearls, Corals, Metals, firſt there ariſes a bubbling and a noiſe, the bubbles aſcend; but when the Connexion of theſe Bodies is looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and they are divided into Atomes, al is quiet, nor do they act any more one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, although each of theſe bodies remains under its own form, as Precipitation and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction teaches. So alſo in the preparation of <hi>Tartarum Vitriolatum,</hi> if Spirit of Vitriol be mingled with Oyl or Salt of Tartar, there ariſes a mighty battle, a noiſe, heat, and boyling. But when theſe two Fighters are duly mixed in their ſmalleſt parts, al the Quartel ceaſes, nor is there any more noiſe or boyling. Nor let any man object, That thoſe ſmalleſt Atomes therefore fight not, becauſe they are by their mutual action one upon another tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered and reduced to moderation. For ſeparation and reduction do ſhew the contrary,
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:35070:147"/>which teach us, that thoſe ſmalleſt Atomes do remain and ſubſiſt under their own proper Form, and are eaſily (being joyned together) reduced into their ancient body again. So the Spirit of Vitriol and Salt of Tartar do in their very mixture retain their Forms entire; which even diſtillation ſhews, by means whereof the Spirit of Vitriol is again ſeparated from the Salt of Tartar, and being ſeparated it ſubſiſts of it ſelf with al its forces entire. Which if it be again poured upon the Salt of Tartar it raiſes a new combate, until theſe Combatants (being mingled in their ſmalleſt parts) come to a Friendly Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>From al which it appears,
<note place="margin">Whether in mixture the Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients muſt needs be reduced into A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes?</note> That although contrary Principles do concur in the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Nutrition of mixed Bodies; yet for their uniting there is no prime neceſſity of a fight, but it ſuffices that they concur in their ſmalleſt Atomes. And this is that which <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> writes in <hi>Lib. de Priſca Medicina:</hi> In a Man there are bitter, and ſalt, and ſweet, and ſowr, and harſh, and taſtleſs parts, and an hundred other ſorts, which being mingled and mutually tempered together are neither diſcerned, nor do they trouble a man; that is to ſay, when they are reduced to their ſmalleſt Atomes, and ſo mingled together. But when they exiſt apart, that is, when many Atomes of the ſame kind being ſeparated from the reſt are joyned together, ſo that they become a conſpicuous coagulated Body, then they exerciſe their Activity. And hereunto tend all the Digeſtions and Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Chymiſts, viz. That Bodies which in a greater bulk were contraries may be reduced into their ſmalleſt Atomes, and afterward agree friendly together and be united.</p>
                  <p>Finally, It hath been alſo no ſmal Cauſe of Error in many,
<note place="margin">The Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Forms is rejected.</note> that ſame vain Fiction of the Eduction of Forms, which we have elſewhere rejected. For although herein (as was ſaid before) <hi>Zabarella</hi> is in the right, when he holds that the Vital Heat is the Agent in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of living things (though it be not the primary Agent which is the form, but its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument) yet ever and anon he fals back into the common Opinion, and endeavors to reduce the Generation of living things alſo unto the Concourſe and ſimple mixture of the Elements. For ſo (<hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Miſti Generat. &amp; Interitu, cap.</hi> 3.) he writes, When five degrees of Heat, and ſix of Moiſture concur, it is a convenient proportion for to educe the form of Oyl. Whereas ſure it is, That Oyl is not generated by a ſimple concourſe of Elements, but is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the Olive Tree. Now Olives are the Fruit of the Olive Tree, which the ſaid Tree produces by its inbred Heat; out of them is preſſed the Oyl after the ſame manner as out of Almonds, Nutmegs, Lin-ſeed, Poppy-ſeed, and Wine out of Grapes.</p>
                  <p>As to that other Queſtion, Whether the Elements alone are mixed?
<note place="margin">Whether the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments only are mixed.</note> or whether there are other ſmal Bodies or Atomes which may truly be mixed? The moſt (truly) of <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>'s Expoſitors do conclude alſo from that ſuppoſition of theirs whereby they hold, That al things are made by the mutual action of the Elements one upon another; that only the Elements alſo are mixed, and that there is no mixture in which there is not a reſolution as far as to the Elements. But he that ſhal diligently conſider what is dayly done in Nature, will obſerve that this is not alwaies neceſſary. The caſe (truly) is plain in thoſe leſs perfect Mixtures; ſince Natural Bodies do retain their perfect Forms in them, as is cleer in Metals diſſolved in <hi>Aqua fortis.</hi> Nor yet is it neceſſary in perfect Miſtion. And I conceive that it is manifeſt in Plants and Animals. For neither are they nouriſhed with pure Elements, but with other mixt bodies created for their ſakes. A man is nouriſhed with blood, and in that Nutrition which is a true Mixture and ſubſtantial mutation blood is not firſt turned into Elements, that of them fleſh may be made, bones, &amp;c. Blood is made of Chyle, Chyle of the meats we eat. In which mutations there is no reſolution into Elements, but as the next matter of a Bone, Fleſh, &amp;c. is blood: ſo the matter of Blood is Chyle; the matter of Chyle is Bread, &amp;c. And there are many Documents of this matter. For if in the ſtomach meat and drink were reſolved into the Elements, no Form or Quality of things which are uſed in meat would remain; whereas nevertheleſs meats which have a purging faculty may turn to blood, and ſo to Milk having the like purging Faculty, which qualities could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the ſimple Elements, if meats were reſolved into them. And many Diſeaſes ariſing from the uſe of naughty meats do more than ſufficiently declare that there is no reſolution as far as to the Elements in the corruption of Meat and generation of Nutriment. For al the more ignoble mixt bodies are matter for the more noble. Thus <hi>Hippocrates</hi> writes of Plants: Such things as grow out of the Earth and are ſown in the Earth, when they come into the ground every one draws that which in the Earth is moſt ſuitable to its own nature. Now there is in the Earth both tart, and bitter, and ſweet, and ſalt, and ſuch like. Firſt therefore it draws much thereout which is accommodate to its nature, and then alſo it draws other parts.</p>
                  <pb n="462" facs="tcp:35070:148"/>
                  <p> Moſt renowned Philoſophers and Phyſitians conſent with <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> Not to ſpeak now of others, <hi>Thomas Eraſtus</hi> in <hi>defenſ. theſ. de ſaporibus</hi> writes; Al Medicaments in a manner do not conſiſt primarily of the Elements, but are compounded of things formerly mixed, and that many times. <hi>Galen</hi> ſhews that the body of Man is compounded, not of the four Elements, but of the four Humors, as the immediate matter of its Generation. Now it is again apparent that theſe Humors are made of the Meat and Drink, which are alſo them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves evidently made of the Juyces of the Earth. For Animals are nouriſhed by Plants, Plants draw out of the Earth juyce familiar to them, as bitter, ſweet, ſowr, becauſe of them the Nature of each properly exiſts. The Seeds (truly) ſown in the ground while they draw to themſelves profitable and convenient Nutriment they draw only ſuch juyce as is compounded of the Elements.</p>
                  <p>And therefore thoſe bodies alſo of which theſe are made, although they are termed the ſmalleſt bodies, yet are they not abſolutely ſuch, but the ſmalleſt of their kind, that is, ſuch as to which thoſe bodies when they are reſolved do return, and conſequently not into Elements, but into thoſe things of which they immediately conſiſt. Milk turns into Butter, Whey, and Cheeſe. So the ſame heat acting upon the homogeneal meat changes it into divers humors, according as it is diſpoſed, nor does it of any Particle form every thing. Wine I conceive is rightly held to be not a thing blended and jumbled, but a perfectly mixt Body infuſed. But if it be put in a Stil and ſtilled, little Spirit that wil burn is drawn forth, much Water remains and a little Earth; becauſe there is more Water than either Fire or Earth in Wine; which yet would not ſo come to paſs if out of every ſmalleſt Particle, Fire, Air and Water might be drawn.</p>
                  <p>For indeed,
<note place="margin">Into what mixt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are reſolved.</note> as hardly any mixt body is compoſed immediately of the Elements; ſo alſo mixt bodies are rarely reſolved into the Elements. Which is apparent by the corruption and reſolution of things, both violent by fire and burning, and natural. That Plants and Animals when they are dead and putrifie are not reſolved quite into the Elements, that ſmel and ſtink does ſufficiently evince which belongs to no Element but is proper to mixt bodies. And as of things living ſome have one ſmel, and ſome another: ſo alſo is it with Plants and dead Carkaſſes. Yea, and the peſtilence hath been frequently obſerved to ariſe from the putrefying Carkaſſes of dead Animals. The ſame happens in violent Reſolutions which are made by Chymical Diſtillations and Sublimations. <hi>Zabarella</hi> indeed <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Miſtor. Generat. &amp; Interitu, cap.</hi> 2. writes, That Cumbuſtion is the mutation of a mixt body into one Element only, namely Fire, ſome part of Earth excepted. Alſo many others do imagine, that if they ſee a ſume or vapor aſcend out of any thing, that the ſaid thing is reſolved into the Elements. But the matter goes far otherwiſe; for the fire retains its own, and gives to others that which is theirs. Fire is uſed in Chymical Diſtillations and Sublimations, ſomtimes gentler, other whiles ſtronger; yet neither of them reſolves things into the Elements. For although ſumes and vapors aſcend; yet if they be received in Alembicks and Receivers, it is apparent that the reſolution is made only into Atomes of a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar kind; and ſome flowers are gathered of Mercury, others of Sulphur, others of Sal Ammoniack. So in Diſtillations although one kind of vapor ſeem to ariſe; yet if it be collected in an Alembick, it appears to be Spirit of Wine, or Cherries, or Juniper, <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> or ſome other Compound. Yea, although they may aſcend inſenſibly, ſo as not to be diſcerned by the eyes, ſo as to paſs through a thick paper four times doubled: yet are they not changed into Air, but into a ſpirit of its own kind. Yea, if Sulphur, or Pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, or Pitch be ſet on fire, they turn not into Elements, but their proper Oyls are gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therefrom.</p>
                  <p>And from what hath been hitherto ſaid, it is apparent that the primary efficient Cauſe of that mixture in Plants and Animals, yea, and al perfectly mixt bodies, as Stones, Jewels, Minerals, and Metals, to conſtitute their Bodies, is that ſame ſpecifick form of a natural body, which draws matter fit for it ſelf, and diſpoſes the ſame after a certain manner.</p>
                  <p>But al other Mixtures which are not directed by a ſuperior form,
<note place="margin">Some Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions are made by conſent &amp; diſſent of Atomes.</note> by what names ſoever called, proceed from the Conſent and Diſſent of Atomes, by means of which like are moved to like, and like are aſſimilated to like. For although this likeneſs and unlikeneſs of Bodies of a kind does not a little help towards the more convenient mixture which is made in Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, and is governed by a more noble Form (as we ſee like meats are more eaſily digeſted than unlike) yet this mixture hath place chiefly in fermentations, either natural or artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, and in the preparations of Medicaments, as alſo in thoſe which are called fortuitous. And this ſimilitude of the ſmalleſt Atomes of a kind as it is the foundation of many mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſo is it of al Solutions. After this manner the fermentation of Wine, Beer, and al
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:35070:148"/>Juyces is made, viz. whiles ſuch as are of the ſame Nature are united, and expel things different from them, and drive them out as dregs; which is chiefly effected by help of that ſame inbred ſpirit which penetrates into al parts; which alſo we ſee betide in the fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or leavening of Bread.</p>
                  <p>What we ſhould think of white and red Wine mingled of Honey and Wine,
<note place="margin">Whether Wines, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments, Treacle, Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date, and diſtilled waters, are bodies really mixed.</note> of Medicinal Wines, Treacle, Mithridate, diſtilled and compounded Waters, and ſuch like, whether they are true mixtures, or only things blended together, is a queſtion amongſt Authors. Some hold they are but things jumbled together. So <hi>Thomas Eraſtus, Disput.</hi> 2. <hi>contra Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celſ. page</hi> 212. ſaies, white and red Wine mingled is but a jumbled thing, and adds this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Becauſe our Taſt tels us, that the taſt of either of them ſtil remains, and that neither Wine hath loſt its own nature, and it cannot be the redneſs ſhould poſſeſs any but its own proper ſubject. And concerning Treacle <hi>Zabarella</hi> writes, <hi>de Miſt. cap.</hi> 13. That Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle hath no true mixture, or if it hath, that it is the mixture of the Elements, and not of the Ingredients of the Treacle. But theſe Opinions are founded upon a ſuppoſition not yet granted, viz. That nothing is mixed but the Elements, which we have before proved to be falſe. And therefore if otherwiſe it is ſufficient to the Conſtitution of Natural Bodies that ſmalleſt Atomes of ſeveral kinds ſhould meet and be united; of which becauſe ſomtimes theſe, otherwhiles thoſe are in greateſt quantity, therefore the taſt, ſmel, color, and other qualities ſomtimes of theſe, otherwhiles of thoſe do abound, as otherwiſe in the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Elements, the Qualities of the predominant Element do excel the reſt: verily I ſhal not deny, when ſuch bodies are firſt blended, they may be termed things jumbled, but when after Fermentation, or frequently repeated diſtillations, they are united in their ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt Particles, I ſee no cauſe why they may not be called bodies truly mixed. And if that cauſe were ſufficient which <hi>Eraſtus</hi> brings to prove that white and red Wine blended are no truly mixt Body, moſt Wines ſhould not be true mixtures; ſince moſt Wines are made of ſeveral ſorts of Grapes, and therefore ſomtimes they taſt like one ſort of Wine, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles like another.</p>

<note place="margin">The eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial parts of living things.</note> and in doubt alſo concerning this matter. Now al living things conſiſt of Soul and Body. Whence they have their Body is cleer enough; but whence they have their Souls is not ſo evident. We are therefore now reſolved to make that our Enquiry. Which whiles we do, we ſhal conſider the matter it ſelf, and not contend only with Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, nor ſhal we bring our ſelves into a Labyrinth and Maze, wherein many wander about and can never get our, whiles one while they follow Reaſon, another while Authority, and make it their buſineſs, alwaies to ſave the Authority of great Authors, and ſo vainly labor (oftentimes) to reconcile Truth and a Lye together.</p>
                  <p>And although there are divers ſorts of Living things; yet ſince al of them have life from the Soul, we ſhal ſpeak in general whence living things receive their Souls, and whence Souls have their Original.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, Some do here briefly quit themſelves, and deny that forms (ſuch as the Soul is) are made. For thus ſaies <hi>Toletus, Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Phyſ. cap.</hi> 9. <hi>qu.</hi> 19. <hi>We wholly deny with</hi> Ariſtotle, <hi>that Forms are made or produced; but Compounds are made, not out of nothing, but of matter; but the Forms are conſequently made and comproduced: whence they are not created, becauſe Creation is an action whereby a thing is firſt made; but the Forms are not firſt made. And this is the power granted to Natural Agents, that they might produce a Compound, and alſo mediately the Forms withal, which is not to create, nor have we any other Philoſophy from</hi> Ariſtotle, <hi>and it is an excellent one, and worthy to be noted.</hi> The ſame Author in the ſame place ſaies thus: <hi>The Form is not produced by it ſelf, but it is comproduced upon the production of the Compound, that is to ſay, the action is determinated primarily upon the Compound it ſelf, and conſequently, and as it were by accident upon the Form.</hi> The Conimbricenſian Collegiates in <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Phyſ. cap.</hi> 9. <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 12. <hi>artic.</hi> 6. thus write: <hi>We anſwer, by ſaying in the firſt place, that no Form except a Mans is properly made; becauſe making is not incident ſave to a thing ſubſiſting of it ſelf.</hi> And <hi>Ruvio Rodenſis, Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Phyſ. cap.</hi> 5. <hi>in queſt.</hi> writes thus: <hi>We deny that the form is made of the matter, or of Privation. For according to the propriety of Nature the Form is neither generated nor made, but the Compound, as</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>expreſsly teacher, Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Phyſ. text.</hi> 64. <hi>in theſe words:</hi> wherefore it is manifeſt from what hath been ſaid, That whatever is made, is ſtil the Compound. And <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> in their Expoſition. <hi>And this Reaſon proves: The making of a thing tends to the Beeing thereof. Therefore it belongs to that only to be made, which hath being: but the Form is not; but it is only ſaid to be the cauſe of being to the Compound, which is properly ſaid to be. Therefore the
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:35070:149"/>form is not made, but the Compound. Which if it be not made;</hi> ergo <hi>it is not made of the Matter, nor of Privation, but the Compound is ſaid to be made of both, by means of the Form from which it hath its being, and whoſe Principles are Matter, Form, and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Now to be drawn out of the Power of the Matter is not to be made of it ſelf, but to go into act, as the cauſe of the Compounds Being, which of it ſelf is generated and made.</hi> So far <hi>Ruvio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Others contrariwiſe do oppoſe this foreſaid Opinion as falſe and abſurd. For ſeeing to the Conſtitution of every Body, Matter, and eſpecially Form which gives the ſpecifical be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is requiſite, and dayly ſome Individuals periſh, and others are generated; of neceſſity the matter and form which before were not, muſt be made. But according to their reaſon which they propound without proof (viz. That neither the Matter not the Form is made, but the Compound) nothing ſhould be made; ſince of the Matter and Form the Compound conſiſts, and the Compound is nothing but the Matter and Form. Nor to the making of any thing is a compleat Being requiſite, but any Being is ſufficient; and that which now is what before it was not, is juſtly ſaid to be made, whether it be an incompleat Being, or a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and Compound. And thoſe are words and founds without Senſe, that Forms are not produced, but comproduced, and that they are not primarily made, but by accident as it were produced upon the production of the Compound. The Compound (truly) is prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily intended in the whol Generation, but it cannot be accompliſhed unleſs al things are made which are required to its Eſſence and Conſtitution. Yea, they themſelves who deny that Forms are made, forgetting themſelves they ſay they are made, when they teach that ſuch things as are drawn out of the power of the Matter do depend upon the matter in their being, making, and operation. Nor do they remove this doubt; but they are forced to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain whence Souls proceed; and at laſt they are forced to hold, That they are drawn out of the power of the Matter.</p>
                  <p>And therefore it cannot be ſimply denied, That Souls after their manner (for whether it be a proper manner of ſpeaking, when Souls are ſaid to be made, even the moſt learned <hi>Caſpar Hofmannus,</hi> in <hi>tr. de formarum origine,</hi> at the beginning doubts) are made.
<note place="margin">Souls are rather multiplied than made</note> Yet if we would ſpeak more properly, they may rather be ſaid to be multiplied than made, according to that vulgar Saying; Every Form hath a power to multiply it ſelf. For thoſe things are properly ſaid to be made which are not at al before they be made. But that is ſaid to be multiplied which whereas before it was one in one Individual, it now becomes manifold, and many in number. Of which I ſhal ſpeak in Chap. 6.</p>

                     <hi>AVicenna</hi> held, That the Souls of living things did not proceed from their Parents,

But ſuch things as are ſaid of thoſe Intelligences in Natural Philoſophy, ſince they are ſaid without any reaſon, they are worthily rejected by Philoſophets. And if there are any Heavenly, Cauſes at al, which make towards the Generation of things, they are remote cauſes, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, as ſhal by and by be ſaid concerning the Opinion of <hi>Fernelius.</hi> And if by that firſt Intelligence they mean the moſt good and great God, this Opinion is alſo falſe.
<note place="margin">How God concurs with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to the generation of things.</note> For the Queſtion is not here concerning the Creation, but the Generation of things.

And if the ſecond Cauſes did nothing, why ſhould there be ſo various a Fabrick in things created, and why are ſo many Vertues and activities beſtowed upon them? and why cannot lifeleſs things perform the ſame Operation as living things? And therefore ſince in the generation of other things we do not look ſimply to God, but joyn alſo the ſecond Cauſes; why ſhould we reject them in the Generation of living things? And if Souls ſhould proceed from God alone and immediately, like could no waies be ſaid to generate its like, nor could that from whence the ſeed of a Plant or Animal is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken be termed the Parent of the new Plant or Animal, but God. And if they ſhould ſay that God uſes the ſeed as an Inſtrument: yet as an Inſtrument, viz. a Chizel cannot be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Efficient Cauſe of an Image, nor the Image be ſaid to be the effect of the Chizel: ſo neither can a living Creature be ſaid to be the Off-ſpring or child of the ſeed. In a word, if any ſuperior Cauſe whatſoever, by <hi>Plato</hi> and the Platoniſts, or by <hi>Avicenna,</hi> ſhal be held the Efficient Cauſe of Souls, there wil be after this reckoning no univocal Generation; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as nevertheleſs moſt certain it is, nor needs it any proof, That like begets its like, an Oak tree an Oak, a Horſe an Horſe, a Man a Man.</p>
                  <p>And what the Platoniſts ſay touching the inferior gods, if they are to be underſtood as the words intimate, any one may eaſily ſee that they are not only ſaid without al reaſon, but void of Truth.</p>

                     <hi>Fernelius</hi> differs not much from them,
<note place="margin">Whether Souls come from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?</note> who <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de abdit. rerum cauſis,</hi> in many places eagerly defends that every Soul comes from the Heaven, &amp; that the Heaven ſends every Soul into matter prepared and fitted. For thus (in chap. 5. towards the end) he writes; <hi>In the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of living Creatures the ſeed conceived is by the Vertue and benign warmth of the Womb ſtirred up to action,

The Seed does only neatly and decently prepare the Matter, the Heaven ſends the form into it when it is prepared, and the chief perfection, and ſtirs up life in all.</hi> And at laſt he concludes: <hi>Whatſoever things God made of old in Heaven or in Earth, he alone defends and governs them all, the Heavenly things indeed by himſelf immediately; but living things and Plants, and other mortal Creatures, by help and aſſiſtance of the Heavens on whom be hath impoſed the Procreative and Conſervative Laws of Nature. And therefore the only form of Heaven does potentially contain the forms of Live Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Plants, Stones, Metals, all that ever have been or can be; and it being big as it were with innumerable forms, engenders and pours all things out of it ſelf: the only power and faculty thereof contains in it all the faculties of mortal things which ever have been, or ſhall be hereafter. And theſe Vertues the Soul of the World ſhed into the whol <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe from Heaven beſtows upon all things, as alſo their form, and native, and vital beat, fit to generate and to conſerve them. It contains all things, and cheriſhes al things with heat and life, ſo that there is not any where any thing not repleniſhed with the fulneſs hereof. By the vertue and means hereof both all lifeleſs things are by themſelves, and al animated things have ſuch a Soul as belongs to their kind, ſome a nouriſhing, others a ſenſitive, and others a rational. So ſhe accommodates her ſelf to things, ſo ſubſervient ſhe is to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of each one, that ſhe gives as much as the Nature and condition of every one deſires, and as much as the preparation it ſelf of the ſubject can bear.

<pb n="467" facs="tcp:35070:150"/>it beſtows only a Beeing, to others alſo a Soul, and that either nouriſhing, ſenſitive, or rational: for it is not received after one manner of all. But of this alſo I would laſtly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh the Reader, That the ſaid Coeleſtial Vertue it ſelf is not alwaies alike, nor does bear it ſelf alwaies alike to ſublunary things, but differently at different times, according to the manifold poſture of the Stars, whoſe commixtion and complexion does for the moſt part vary, although the Subſtance of the Soul of the World (or carrying ſpirit) is unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably one. It cannot therefore come to paſs (as one man ſaies) that the Soul of the World ſo imparts life and ſtate to all things as that it needs not the leaſt help of the Stars. If this were ſo, why I pray you ſhould it not alwaies generate like things, and after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſeeing it is alwaies alike preſent to things.</hi> So far <hi>Fernelius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the chief Arguments whereby he endeavors to prove his Opinion are theſe: The firſt is, That of putrefying matter many Animals are bred, which ſince they come of no Seed, and from no Patent, he concludes their Soul comes from Heaven; and therefore ſince thoſe more ignoble Animals receive their Souls from Heaven, he thinks the more nobler Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as a Man and a Lyon, ſhould much rather receive their Souls from Heaven. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſeeing <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> writ, That a Man and the Sun beget a Man, he conceives they do not both concur after the ſame manner to the generation of a Man, nor that the ſame thing is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by both of them; but ſince two things are required, the Matter and the Form, that by Man as the more imperfect nature the Matter is prepared, and the Soul ſent in from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Thirdly, He diſputes at large againſt the Eduction of Forms out of the power of the matter. Fourthly, He produces many things touching the nobility of the Heaven, and its action upon theſe lower bodies. Finally, Since the Soul is united to the Body by help of an Heavenly kind of heat and ſpirit, he holds the Soul it ſelf muſt much rather be of a Coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Original.</p>
                  <p>But in good deed this Opinion is far from the truth.
<note place="margin">Fernelius <hi>his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Original of Souls confuted.</hi>
                     </note> For ſeeing that living things which are generated are of the ſame ſort with thoſe by which they are generated, how can this be true if the Generator do only diſpoſe the matter to receive the Form, and do not impart the Form it ſelf? and al living things ſhould rather be termed the Off-ſpring of Heaven, than of thoſe things by which they are generated. And though there be a conſent of the upper and lower bodies, and the Heaven as an univerſal Cauſe does further the Original of things;
<note place="margin">His Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</note> yet it does not follow, That the Heaven gives Forms to ſo many ſeveral ſorts of things. And what need is there to derive the Souls of things from Heaven, ſince God the Creator in the firſt Creation gave to al living things the power to multiply themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Nor are thoſe Reaſons which moved him to maintain this Opinion of any ſtrength. For in the firſt place, That living things Generated of themſelves have their cauſe here below ſhal be ſhewed hereafter. Nor if there be any thing noble here below muſt that needs be deduced from Heaven, but living things themſelves have their degree of dignity; and man the moſt noble of al is nobler than the Heaven. Secondly, though <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> wrote that the Sun and Man generates a Man; yet is not that to be otherwiſe underſtood than that the Heaven as a remote and general Cauſe, and Man as the immediate Cauſe generates a Man. Nor (as was ſaid) is Man more ignoble than the Heaven, ſo that he only ſhould prepare the Matter, and the Heaven give the Form. Thirdly, He does rightly oppoſe the Eduction of Forms out of Matter, and we ſhal do the ſame hereafter: but it does not follow, If Forms are not educed out of the Matter, that therefore they are procreated by the Heavens. For we ſhal hereafter demonſtrate another manner of their Original. And as in the fourth place we grant the Nobility of the Heaven, and its action upon theſe lower bodies; yet it no waies follows therefrom that it is the Author of al Forms. Finally, although it were granted that the innate heat and ſpirit, which the forms of living things uſe as their immediate Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and which may therefore be called the band of the Soul and Body, may after a ſort be termed Coeleſtial; yet that only does thence follow, that the Souls themſelves are more noble than that ſpirit and inbred heat, but not that they proceed from Heaven. In a word, as <hi>Thomas Eraſtus, de Occult. med. propriet. Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 17. does wel write: They that dare affirm the Forms of the ſorts of things are infuſed by the Stars wil be laught at by Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers; and by Chriſtians alſo rightly judged execrable. The Forms have received their Original not from Heaven, but from the Creator, if they wil rather beleeve the Hiſtory of the Creation than lying Fables. God commanded that every Species or ſort of things ſhould propagate it ſelf by multiplication of Individuals endued with the ſame Faculties; he di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>SInce therefore the Soul proceeds not from the Heaven and ſuperior Cauſes, many grant that like begets its like. Which yet moſt do underſtand only of univocal Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<note place="margin">A twofold Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Living things.</note> For they hold a twofold Generation; one univocal, whereby like begets its like; the other Equivocal, where the Ingenderer is of a different nature from the thing ingendred; which they ſay happens in ſuch things as are bred of themſelves, and without Seed. But whether there be any ſuch Equivocal Generation, and what the Nature of the Spontaneous Original of living things is, we ſhal ſhew hereafter in its place. It ſuffices in this place that in Univocal Generation ſo called, it is granted by moſt, and by al that do not draw the forms from Heaven or a ſuperior Cauſe,

Yet in good deed, although al agree herein; yet they differ much as touching the manner, and there are many and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Opinions of Authors hereabouts, al which may nevertheleſs be (I conceive) reduced to four Tribes. For firſt ſome hold the Seed to be inanimate; who are again divided into two companies; whiles ſome hold the Seed communicated by the Generator to be only inſtead of matter, out of the aptitude whereof the Soul is educed by an external Agent: ſome ſay there is a formative Vertue communicated to the Seed by the Generator, and they hold that it is the ſhaper of the Body of the living thing; or they conceive the Generator uſes the Seed as an Inſtrument to beget its like. But others hold that the Seed is animated; yet they are of two opinions; for ſome hold there is in al Seed (even that of a Man) its proper Soul; but ſome conceive the Soul of Man (by reaſon of a ſingular prerogative) is to be exempted, and that it comes into the Body after it is formed from without; though they themſelves differ about the time when the Soul comes: Touching al which Opinions we are now to ſpeak ſeverally.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit the Reader muſt firſt be warned of a vulgar Error.

In which thing nevertheleſs I ſee many offend, who deliver what ſhould be ſaid of the original of the Soul, and formation of the Body of a living thing in general, concerning a Man only, and ſo they offend againſt the Law of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, endeavoring to demonſtrate the affections belonging to the whol kind of one ſort only. I conceive it therefore more convenient to propound in general whatſoever may be ſaid of the Original of living things, and of Souls in general; and afterwards to apply them particularly to Plants, Animals, and Man-kind; and what theſe ſorts of living Creatures have peculiar, to ſet that down by it ſelf.</p>

                  <p>IN the firſt place therefore,
<note place="margin">Whether Souls are drawn out of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the matter</note> amongſt thoſe who hold the ſeed to be inanimate, it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion, that all forms and conſequently all Souls, except the rational ſoul of a man are drawn out of the aptitude of the matter. But who was the firſt Author of this Opinion, is not ſo certain. Moſt do indeed father it upon <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> but I doubt whether it can be demonſtrated from his works. Some, and amongſt them <hi>Franciſcus Bonamicus,</hi> do at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to <hi>Averroes</hi> this Opinion;
<note place="margin">Who was the Author of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of drawing of form out of th aptitude of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> and ſome ſuch words are found in his Books; but it many times happens, that Expoſitors patch many things of their own upon Authors. But whether he held what is vulgarly taught is a great queſtion. For it is apparent, as from other places, ſo from 7. <hi>Metaphyſ. text.</hi> 31. That he held the Cauſe of the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of living things, or rather of the formation of a living Body, to be the form lurking in the Seed. For ſeeing there <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> compares Artificial things with Natural, and tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Seed which is the Efficient, he ſaies, It makes, <hi>Averrhoes</hi> adds; the Seed gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates by a power it hath like to an Artificer; becauſe the form of the thing generated is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And a little after: In the matter of things generated the is an aptitude that out of it may be bred a like thing by the power which is in the See.</p>
                  <pb n="469" facs="tcp:35070:151"/>
                  <p> But moſt of the Schoolmen and their followers have fiercely maintained this Opinion of the education of Souls out of the aptitude of the matter, and have handed it over to poſterity without any cleer ſence, which a mind deſirous of truth might conceive; ſo that moſt of them ſeem rather to have tranſcribed the words of their Maſters, than to have underſtood the thing it ſelf. And how indeed could they underſtand where there was nothing to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood?</p>
                  <p>But whoever was the Author of this Opinion, and whatever Patrons it hath; it muſt by al means be weighed and conſidered, ſince many contend for it as if their life lay at the ſtake, and uſe it as an infallible Principle to decide many Controverſies. Now, two things theſe Authors do: Firſt, they ſet down the reaſons moving them thus to think, or rather they oppoſe the Opinions of others: and in the next place they endeavor to explain and declare their ſaid Opinion.</p>
                  <p>And in the firſt place (truly) as appears out of <hi>Fonſeca, Comment. in</hi> 5. <hi>Met. cap.</hi> 2. <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 4. Suarez, 12. <hi>Metaphyſ. diſput. Sect.</hi> 1, 2. Bonamicus, Ruvius, <hi>in</hi> 1. <hi>Phyſ. tract.</hi> 2. <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 1. and others, they bring hardly any evident reaſons for their own Opinion, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeavor to bring thoſe that think otherwiſe into ſome abſurdity; which is a very ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious way of dealing. For it is the part of a good and Ingenuous Diſputer firſt to prove his own Opinion with firm Reaſons, afterwards to oppoſe the contrary. And nothing can be ſaid ſo true and manifeſt which by contentious wits may not be called in queſtion. I count it not worth the while to tranſcribe the places of Authors entire; ſeeing they are in the hands of al, and moſt of them bring nothing new, but repeat the ſame thing over and over again. But if any reaſons may be gathered out of them, they are theſe:</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Reaſons for the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of forms out of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the matter.</note> In the firſt place therefore, They would prove that Forms are drawn out of the power of the Matter, becauſe they depend upon the Matter in their making, their being, and operation. But this is to beg the Queſtion, and there is no connexion of the major. For we grant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that thoſe inſeparable Forms cannot be made (or rather propagated) without the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that they are, and work in, and with the matter: but it does not hence follow, that the Form is drawn out of the power of the Matter, and depends in its eſſence upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is meerly paſſive. But the Queſtion ſtil remains, Whence thoſe Forms which can neither be made, nor be, nor operate without the matter, or out of the matter, have their Original.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Unleſs we hold that Forms are drawn out of the aptitude of the matter, they conceive al Generation is taken away. Which argument whether it be a direct proof, or a deduction to an abſurdity, I leave to others to judg. For either (ſay they) the Forms are ſomthing before Generation, or they are nothing. If they were before Generation, there can be no Generation; if they are nothing there wil be a Creation, and ſo Generation is again taken away. But this Dilemma is of no weight, nor is there any ſtrength in either of its horns. For ſince they were al for the moſt part Divines who thus wrote, they ought to have conſidered what that text of Scripture imports, <hi>Encreaſe and multiply;</hi> yea, and how that axiome of Philoſophers is to be underſtood, That every Form can multiply it ſelf. For if they had underſtood that Souls can multiply themſelves,
<note place="margin">How living things are generated.</note> they had underſtood withal that when any particular thing generates, a ſoul is not created anew, but multiplied; and that the Souls of the firſt Individuals of every ſort, created by God at the beginning of the World, did and do ſuffice to propagate al the Souls of al the Individuals that ever have been, or ever ſhal be; and they had underſtood withal that when Souls which were before are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied, generation is not taken away, but rather eſtabliſhed. For though the Soul were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and only one in number; yet when it multiplies it ſelf, and diffuſes it ſelf into more Individuals, Generation is rightly ſaid to be made.
<note place="margin">when ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of living things is truly made</note> Where notwithſtanding we muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently obſerve when Generation is truly made. They indeed hold, when of a grain of Wheat there ſprings up a Wheat ſtalk and ear, or when a Chick comes out of an Eg, then generation is made. And it may indeed be granted, that after a ſort Generation is then made. But if we would ſpeak properly, ſince Generation is (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> teaches, <hi>de reſpiratione, cap.</hi> 18.) <hi>The firſt communication of the nutritive Soul together with the inbred Heat;</hi> that communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is then performed when Seed is bred and ſeparated from the Generator: and then Plants, then Animals breed, when they communicate their Soul together with their native heat unto the Seed, and caſt the ſame forth of themſelves, but not when a Plant or Animal is produced of the Seed. Which is hereby apparent, in that when Plants ſpring up out of the ſeed the Plant that bred the ſeed may be deſtroyed, and when the Chick is hatched out of the Egg, the Cock and Hen whence that Egg came may be both dead, and ſo can neither communicate the Native Heat, nor the Soul. And therefore <hi>Julius Caeſar Scaliger, Exercit.</hi> 6. <hi>Sect.</hi> 10.
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:35070:152"/>The Tree ingenders (ſaies he) when it produces Seed; but a Tree is not generated when it ſhoots up from the Seed; but then that which was generated and imperfect is perfected. So a Dog does not engender when the Whelps are brought forth, but when the Seed is bred.</p>
                  <p>But when they that hold Forms are drawn out of the power or aptitude of the Matter would explain their Opinion,
<note place="margin">whether that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the eduction of forms out of the power of matter can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</note> they variouſly and miſerably vex themſelves and trouble their Brains to no purpoſe; as is uſual when there is nothing at the bottom; and while they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to explain the matter, they rather obſcure and perplex the ſame, as may be ſeen out of the Authors fore-alleadged, alſo from <hi>Tolet.</hi> 1. <hi>Phyſic. cap.</hi> 9. <hi>qu.</hi> 19. and 1. <hi>de gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. &amp; corrupt. cap.</hi> 3. <hi>qu.</hi> 2.

And <hi>Benedictus Pererius, Lib.</hi> 14. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. at the end, where he treats of the Original of Forms, and endeavors to anſwer ſome doubts, at laſt he concludes: <hi>Whether theſe Anſwers are true, and whether they quite take away the difficulties propoſed, I leave to the judgment and conſideration of learned men: they do not (truly) quite take away my ſcruple, nor perfectly ſatisfie my mind. For they involve certain things which ſeem either abſolutely falſe, or more doubtful than that whereof we now doubt; ſuch as is, that there is an</hi> ultimum <hi>or laſt of Quality, which may be brought in in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which follow the Opinion of drawing the Forms out of the aptitude of the matter</note> And indeed they can no waies anſwer the doubts that are brought againſt their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. For if you ask them, what it is to be brought out of the power of the matter? or what that power is? they anſwer, That it is the diſpoſition of the matter to a certain form, that when the ordinary power of the Agent or efficient is added, a form grows and reſults therefrom. But when they themſelves grant, that this diſpoſition belongs to the ſecond mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (not to the firſt, for that is indifferent to receive al forms, nor more determined to one than another. And if the firſt matter ſhould contain al forms in its boſom, and the forms did owe their Original to the firſt matter, that matter were a more noble principle than the form) ſince one diſpoſition is required to the form of an Oak, another to the form of a Chick, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to draw out the form of a Horſe; and the ſame Expounders of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> determine, that the Matter wherein ſuch ſpecifick forms hang, is the Elements variouſly mixed and diſpoſed: it is demanded (ſince they hold the form is made actually, which was there before potential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) Whether it be made of nothing? or whether that ſame diſpoſition and Qualities of the Matter, which are nothing but a certain temper of a mixed body, or the very form it ſelf of the mixt Body or Elements, is changed into the form of an Oak, an Hen, or an Horſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> None of which can be ſaid without abſurdity; ſince neither an accident can be changed into a ſubſtance, nor one form into another; nor can the forms of living things be compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the Elements. And which way ſoever that diſpoſition to the form can be explained (ſince it is made ſucceſſively by parts, and the laſt degree is of the ſame kind and perfection with the former) it cannot make up the act of a thing, nor give Eſſence to a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, Neither can they produce any thing of certainty concerning the immediate and principal Efficient of that Form which they ſay is drawn out of the power of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The matter it ſelf being a paſſive principle cannot be the Efficient cauſe; nor the Sun, or other Stars (ſince they are only remote and ſpecifical, not univerſal cauſes, as was ſaid before, Chap. 2.) Nor the external Heat of the Air, Womb, Hen-ſitting, Furnace, or any external thing whatſoever. For ſo a ſubſtance ſhould be produced by an accident. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, there could not be aſſigned a ſpecifical Cauſe of a ſpecial Effect; but the ſame ſpecial Effect ſhould be produced by divers Cauſes: as we ſee Plants ſprout out of the Seed both by the heat of the Sun and of a Stove, and the Chickens of one Bird hatched by another Bird not of the ſame, but a different kind; yea, and the ſeeds of Silkworms are hatched in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of a Damſel, as <hi>Vida</hi> relates in his <hi>Poeme of the Silkworm.</hi> Moreover by the action of
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:35070:152"/>one Agent moſt different Forms ſhould be produced. For ſince in the ſame Garden moſt different Plants do grow, they cannot al proceed from the ſame Agent, viz. The external Heat. Moreover, according to this Opinion the things generated ſhould not have their form from the Generator, but only a diſpoſition to the form, which afterwards of its own accord upon the action of an external Agent (as Heat for example) ſhould ſpring out of the power of the matter, the Agent communicating nothing thereunto. And ſo according to this Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it cannot be ſaid that a living thing begets its like, not that every form does multiply it ſelf: which yet al ſound Philoſophers do grant. For if the Generator ſhould transfer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of its own Eſſence into the thing Generated, but ſhould only determine the matter to ſuch a like form, and afterward the Efficient (which is not of the ſame kind) ſhould make it actually to break forth; how I pray you can the form be ſaid to multiply it ſelf? Verily, if ſome Plant in the <hi>Indies</hi> when it produces Seed gives nothing but the matter with a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate aptitude to receive a like form, out of which after a yeer, two, or three, the Plant it ſelf being now burnt or putrefied, the form ſhould break out by vertue of heat, not only of the Sun, but of the fire in a ſtove, as the Agent: that Plant cannot be ſaid to have bred its like, nor that form to have multiplied it ſelf. Nor is it enough to cauſe an univocal Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the true production of a like Eſſence, to afford a matter with ſome proclivity and propenſion to receive the form. And after this reckoning the Agent heat (and that an accident) ſhould confer more towards the Generation than the Generator it ſelf, ſince it makes the form actually to ariſe which the Generator cauſed to be there only potentially. And thus it remains yet unexplained, whence the ſubſtantial and ſpecifick form of a thing, or that more excellent, more divine and chief part of a thing hath its Original. Mean while we grant that the diſpoſition of the matter is neceſſary to the Generation of living things, ſince every mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not fit to receive every form, but a determinate matter a determinate form: but not that the form or ſoul ſhould be made out of it; but that it may be propagated thereinto, and afterwards dwel therein, as ſhal be ſaid hereafter.</p>

                        <hi>The Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of</hi> Fortunius Licetus <hi>concerning the Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Forms out of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the Matter.</hi>
                     </note> endeavors to explain the Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of forms out of the power of the matter, after this manner: We ſay (quoth he) that the Eduction of the form out of the boſom of the matter is not the drawing out of that which lies hid into the open view, but the converſion of aptitude into act. For the form which is produced by the Agent only by the tranſmutation of the matter did potentially pre-exiſt therein, out of which it is brought into act. Moreover, we deny that the Form is made of nothing, and abſolutely created, if it be granted that it is not made of the matter as a principle, nor out of that in which it did actually pre-exiſt. For in the firſt place, whatſoever things are truly created they are made ſimply of nothing, and of no ſubject at al; but al forms under the Soul of Man are made of nothing of their own, but not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of nothing, as thoſe things which are created; ſince forms are made by the agent, by a tranſmutation made in ſuch a determinate ſubject, on which therefore the forms depend in their Being, and by which added to their Eſſence they are defined according to <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> Again, if it were not ſo accidents alſo ſhould be made of nothing, and moſt properly crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: for no heat did pre-exiſt in the water which is made hot. But verily forms are not truly created, nor are they out of nothing of their own, but properly out of the boſom of the Matter they are drawn, and out of the aptitude thereof, becauſe they are truly generated of ſome rudiment of themſelves pre-exiſting in the matter, which rudiment of the form is perfected by the action of the Agent, and turns to a perfect Form. So far <hi>Licetus.</hi> But this is a vain put-off. For let <hi>Licetus</hi> teach us what that Rudiment of a Form is. Whether the ſubſtance of the matter it ſelf, or ſome accident thereof. If the former, (to which he ſeems to incline when he writes that the forms are made by the agent, by a tranſmutation made in ſuch a ſubject ſo determined) then the matter ſhould be changed into Form: if the latter, an accident muſt be changed into a ſubſtance. Let him ſhew us alſo, that there is any rudiment and beginning of a form, ſince forms are indiviſible, and have their Eſſence like numbers; and therefore where they are they are totally, or not at al. Nor does the ſame <hi>Fortunius Licetus</hi> explain this matter more happily, <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de ſpont. vivent. ortu, cap.</hi> 15. where he defines the Beginning of Forms, and holds that in the matter there is pre-exiſting a rudiment of the future form, that the generical nature of that form remains under the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite privation, to which the efficient cauſe joyning the ſpecifical difference of the form is ſaid both to conſtitute the form, and to further the Generation, and at once to generate a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance compounded of matter and form. But that ſame pre-conceived Opinion touching the eduction of forms out of the power of the matter ſeduced that man, otherwiſe a moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent ſearcher into Nature. For no form is capable of more or leſs, but conſiſts in an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:35070:153"/>point, nor can it be remitted, ſince remiſſion is made by mixture of a contrary, nor is it poſſible that the form ſhould firſt have a generical Nature, and receive the ſpecifical diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence from the Efficient. And whereas <hi>Licetus</hi> denies thoſe axiomes owned by al Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and ſaies they hold true only in compound ſubſtances, but not in ſimple; this he does without Reaſon. For ſince compound ſubſtances become ſuch by reaſon of the ſimple of which they conſiſt, if the ſimple ſubſtances, matter, and form, may be remitted, alſo the compound might be remitted; and ſince the form gives being to the thing by reaſon of the form the compound alſo ſhould be more or leſs ſuch. Nor does <hi>Licetus</hi> agree with himſelf in this point, ſince in the ſame Book, chap. 2. he writes, That thoſe things which are ſaid to breed of themſelves are not made by an external Agent, but by an Agent which lies hid in the matter of the thing to be made, which does not generate a new form different from it ſelf, but exhibits it ſelf thereto for a new form, that is to ſay, communicates it ſelf. Nor is there in the Soul (which is a moſt ſimple Eſſence) any compoſition of ſundry Eſſential parts, and in ſuch a manner, that like a Genus it might be preſent without a ſpecifical difference. The Soul is one moſt ſimple Eſſence, only furniſhed with ſundry faculties. Nor can he ſhew how that remiſſion is made. For whereas <hi>Licetus</hi> ſaies, that only an accidental remiſſion or abatement is made by the mixture of a contrary, but not an eſſential, ſuch as he holds to be in forms, is aſſerted without any reaſon; and it lies him in hand to prove, That (as he feigns) an eſſential remiſſion may be made without admixture of a contrary. And which way ſoever he turns himſelf he fals into abſurdities, and contradicts himſelf. For when he ſaies that that ſame rudiment of a form is no true form, but the generical Nature thereof, and that the kinds have an Eſſence really diſtinct from their ſorts, he confounds Logical Conceptions with the Nature it ſelf of things,
<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of a Logical &amp; a Natural kind.</note> or the Logical kind with the Natural. For the Logical kind is in the mind, and is by the mind abſtracted from the ſorts; but the Phyſical Genus ſignifies a common nature, which conſiſts in the things themſelves out of the Mind. And the Logical kind indeed may by the mind be ſeparated from the ſorts; but the Phyſical kind does not exiſt in Nature, ſave in its ſorts, nor does the Animal exiſt any where ſave in a Man, a Lyon, a Horſe, &amp;c. And therefore it is a vain figment to ſay that the Generical Nature is the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment of the Form, and as it were half the Form. And from this very Opinion it would follow, that like does not engender its like. For ſince the ſpecifical Form gives to every thing its Nature, but not the Generical; if the Generator ſhould only afford the matter wherein the Generical form is, or a rudiment of the Form, or an half form, as <hi>Licetus</hi> ſpeaks; but the external agent as Heat ſhould introduce the ſpecifick difference; not the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor which might die in the mean time before the external agent come ſhould be the Parent and Author of the thing generated, but the external Agent; and that not univocal, but equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal. Alſo I wonder a man ſo exceeding learned ſhould defend this Doctrine of the Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Forms, ſince he hath no need thereof to explain his Opinion, as holding in 1. <hi>de ſponte vivent. ortu, cap.</hi> 125. That the ſeed is animated, and <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 32. that it is an imperfect Animal: and he holds that ſuch things as are ſaid to be generated of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord do not proceed from an external Agent, but from an Agent that lies hid within the matter, as was lately ſaid.</p>
                  <p>But which way ſoever they turn themſelves, the matter comes to the ſame paſs, that they are fain to confeſs, that beſides the diſpoſition of the matter there is ſomwhat formal in the Seed, the cauſe of action, and that beſides the diſpoſition of the matter there needs ſomwhat elſe by which the thing may be brought into its perfect act. And that power of which they ſpeak they are forced at laſt to explain to be meant not of a paſſive power, but an active, which makes that that which is in the firſt act come to be in the ſecond act, or in an act ſimply; ſo that that Soul which was deſtitute of Inſtruments to operate by is now furniſhed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, ſo that it is able to operate. Which very thing alſo <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> taught; when in 7. <hi>Metaphyſ. cap.</hi> 9. <hi>tit.</hi> 31. he writes: <hi>The Seed hath the Form potentially in it ſelf, which after a ſort hath the ſame name with that from whence it came.</hi> And 2. <hi>de Generat. cap.</hi> 1. <hi>It is all one whether you name the Seed, or that from whence it came.</hi> For the Sum of the buſineſs is, That that Power which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaks of is formal, as later Writers phraze it,
<note place="margin">Whether the Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Form out of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the Matter he founded on the holy Scriptures</note> and differs not from the firſt act.</p>
                  <p>A certain late Writer (whoſe Underſtanding is capable of nothing but what is Elementary) when he ſaw he could not defend the Eduction of Forms out of the power of the Matter by any Philoſophical reaſon, at laſt he flies to the Authority of the Holy Scriptures. But he endeavors to introduce his own mind and pre-conceived Opinion into the holy Scriptures, whiles he holds, that <hi>Moſes, Gen.</hi> 1. when he brings in <hi>God</hi> ſaying; <hi>Let the Earth bring forth, let the Water bring forth the living Creature,</hi> does aſſert that the Souls of Plants
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:35070:153"/>and Beaſts were then by God produced, and do at this day ariſe from the Elementary mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And thus therefore he explains it, that the ſpecifical Forms are not made of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, inaſmuch as they are the matter of the mixtion, and the conven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For ſince the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments contain no matter but the firſt, he muſt needs by that univerſal matter underſtand the firſt matter. But who I pray you, either Philoſopher or Divine, did over ſo teach concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the firſt Matter, eſpecially being conſidered without the Forms of the Elements? Did <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (whoſe Opinion he conceives this of the Eduction of Forms to be) know any thing of that Divine Benediction given at the firſt Creation? And where do we read (I pray you) in the Scriptures that God ſo bleſſed that Univerſal Matter? This indeed we read in the firſt of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> That God once commanded that the Earth and Waters ſhould bring forth Animals created by him; and when they being created by God were come out of the Earth and Water like a Child out of the Womb, as <hi>Franciſcus Junius</hi> ſpeaks in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, we do not read that God again commanded that the Earth and Water ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Plants and Animals, and that he bleſſed them to that intent; but thus we read, That the Earth brought forth the green Herb bearing Seed, and the Tree bearing Fruit, and each thing having ſeed according to its kind; and that God bleſſed the Fiſhes and Birds being created, ſaying; Encreaſe and multiply, and fil the Waters of the Sea, and let Birds multiply upon the Earth.</p>

<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of</hi> Jacobus Schegkius.</note> and teaches, That he thereby underſtands a ſubſtantial Form, which could be perceived by no ſenſe, but by the mind and underſtanding. Howbeit, he holds that the Seed and this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Form are not principal but inſtrumental Agents, and form the animated Bodies like the Hand of an Artificer. He ſaies, That it is a ſubſtantial Act, ſeparable from the ſubſtance of the firſt Act, which hath for its proper ſubject the Spermatical Humor. And again, that the Seed is an Inſtrumental Cauſe, and a certain efficient Principle, but not an efficient Material, making or generating the animated Body, and not being it ſelf animated, but a Medium in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed betwixt that which is animated and that which is to be animated, without the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of any matter able to effect as a certain ſecond act or energie. But unleſs the Opinion of <hi>Schegkius</hi> be ſo explained, that this Formative Principle is the Soul it ſelf by which the Seed is animated, and the Seed of ſuch or ſuch a Creature; and that the Formative Power is a proper adjunct of the Soul, which it hath when it is in the Seed, and exerciſes the ſame when an Animal is generated; but inaſmuch as there is not in the Seed actually an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical Body which the Soul may inform, in that reſpect the Form may be ſaid to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent:
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:35070:154"/>then it cannot be admitted. For to hold a Formative Principle which is not the Soul, is raſhly to multiply things more than needs.

Avicennae, &amp; de Hippoc. Philoſophia,</hi> as he is cited by <hi>Fienus</hi> in his Apology. For he holds the Seed to be only an Inſtrument. But when he eaſily perceived many abſurdities would follow if the Seed ſhould be counted ſimply as an Inſtrument, he diſtinguiſhes betwixt an Inſtrument conjoyned and ſeparate. And he conceives that the neceſſity of this diſtinction is taken from the diverſity of the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Agents, and the Nature of the Order of things. For ſome operate with a Medium and without a Medium as living things; others of an inferior Rank have not ſo great perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and they work by themſelves. He tels us therefore that ſeparate Inſtruments do work by a permanent Vertue which they have received from the Agent; but the conjoyned Inſtruments do ſucceſſively receive the Vertue of the Agent, and therefore operate with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon the firſt principal Agent. He explains the Nature of a ſeparate Inſtrument by an Example political. For a King or ſome Potentate operates in far diſtant places as if he were preſent, by power derived from himſelf, which he confers upon the Laws and Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: but private men that live only for themſelves muſt operate by themſelves. He brings afterward another example whereby he would prove his Opinion, viz. Of Watches, Clocks, and Engines wherein many Wheels are orderly moved in the abſence of the Workman, yet by a vertue imprinted upon them by the firſt direction of the Artiſt. The Nature of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned Inſtruments he explains by the ſimilitude of a Saw, which lying ſtil hath ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that it may receive motion in order to cutting; yet is it not an acting Inſtrument til it receive guidance to motion and cutting from the Sawyer. That there is a ſeparate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument he alſo proves by the motion of hurling. For a ſtone hurled wil fly, though the thrower ſhould preſently fal down dead. And ſo he holds it is in the matter or Seed, how that Animals Generate their Seed being caſt out of them, a derivative vertue continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining therein, that it can work, and does actually work without any actual Influx from the Generator.</p>
                  <p>But this Opinion however explained and palliated is falſe and far from truth.
<note place="margin">This Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> For <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf, 7. <hi>Metaphyſ. c.</hi> 9. <hi>t.</hi> 31. reckons the Seed amongſt univocal Agents. But al univocal Agents are not inſtrumental but principal Cauſes. Again, al Inſtruments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called are joyned with the principal Agent, and as <hi>Schegkius</hi> himſelf ſpeaks, an Inſtrument of it ſelf hath no Efficacy, but only by the Uſe of the Principal Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>And thoſe things which are brought by <hi>Antonius Ponce</hi> concerning a ſeparate Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (unleſs rightly explained) are falſe and feigned without reaſon,
<note place="margin">There is no ſeparate Inſtrument which acts by it ſelf.</note> and therefore are not to be accounted a Metaphyſical Principle, as he gives them out to be. Indeed the Seed might be called a ſeparate Inſtrument, viz. Inaſmuch as the Seed is not neceſſarily joyned with the Generator, but is ſubordinate thereunto, and hath received from the Generator the ſame power, yea, and the ſame Soul which the Generator it ſelf hath. But while he denies the Soul to be in the Seed, he labors in vain when he cals the Seed a ſeparate Inſtrument. For although while an Inſtrument is not imployed it may be really ſeparated from the principal Agent, as a Pencil from a Painter, an Ax from a Carpenter, a Pen from a Writer: yet no Inſtrument can be named which in the action it ſelf operates by a power within it ſelf (for ſo it ſhould be a principal Agent, not an Inſtrumental) but every Inſtrument in its operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath no power of it ſelf, but it depends upon, and is directed in its action by the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Agent, and when it is ſeparated it can no longer work by it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>We muſt therefore diſtinguiſh betwixt the firſt and ſecond act of an Inſtrument.
<note place="margin">The firſt &amp; ſecond Act of an Inſtrument</note> That any thing may be an Inſtrument in the firſt act, it is ſufficient that it be ſhaped and fitted as an Inſtrument for ſome particular action. An Iron Hammer in regard of its hardneſs, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs, and ſhape, is an Inſtrument fit to beat Gold and other Metals, and to figure and form them into ſome certain ſhape; but this is only in the firſt act. For an Hammer thus ſhaped
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:35070:154"/>wil never of it ſelf beat out any metal, but the preſence and motion of the Artificer is neceſſary to dilate the ſame, and then the Hammer is an Inſtrument <hi>actu ſecundo,</hi> by the ſecond act. So native heat is an Inſtrument whereby Nature digeſts Chyle, and forms Blood, Fleſh, and Bones. But the heat cannot perform this, unleſs the ſoul which is the principal Inſtrument concur. And it is the nature of an Inſtrument to act above its own abilities,
<note place="margin">An Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the principal Cauſe Acts beyond its own Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</note> and to produce an effect more noble than it ſelf, viz. inaſmuch as it is directed and moved by the principal Cauſe: which while it ſo directs and moves does not imprint any virtue upon the Inſtrument, by which it may perform that Action which belongs to the principal Agent. For neither does the Artiſt neceſſarily make his Inſtruments, but he receives them made to his hand, either by Nature or Art, and he makes uſe of them being by Nature or Art fitted to his turn, as may be ſeen in the Saw uſed by the Joyner, which he had of the Smith, and in the Cole or Chalk which the Painter uſes. And therefore that political example of a King working a great way off by Laws and Judges, as a moral Inſtance, does not ſquare with things natural. And the ſubordinate Judges are rather Miniſters than Inſtruments of the ſupream Judg, nor do they act by any Phyſical Virtue communicated. For neither do In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments properly ſo called perform the work of the principal cauſe as its Vicars or Subſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, ſo as to perform the ſame action with the principal Cauſe, though after a manner deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and communicated from the ſaid principal Cauſe; but they are only Con-cauſes and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workers, and unleſs the Artiſt did work they ſhould do nothing; and when the motion of the principal Agent ceaſes, they alſo ceaſe from their action.</p>
                  <p>As to the example about the motion and impulſe of things hurled,
<note place="margin">The Cauſe of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</note> it does not ſufficiently prove the force impreſſed upon Inſtruments. For after what manner that motion of things hurled is cauſed, is not ſufficiently manifeſt, and much controverted amongſt Philoſophers. It is moſt likely that this motion is made by the Air, or through means of the Air, and by the force of the throw. For no man could yet ever tel what that virtue is impreſſed by the Thrower, &amp; how it can be imprinted by the local motion of the Arm, ſomtimes immediately, otherwhiles mediately as by a Sling where it ſticks; how again it is ſo ſuddainly loſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. And there are doubtleſs more abſurdities which follow this Opinion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot be allowed to confirm the received Virtue of a ſeparated Inſtrument.</p>
                  <p>And as to thoſe examples of artificial Engines, as Clocks, Watches, Water-works; theſe things are artificial, in which the motive faculty it ſelf, which is wholly natural, is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by Art to thoſe Engines, as appears by the weights hung on by the ſpring: but that motion is directed by Wheels artificially made. But it is far otherwiſe with natural Agents.</p>
                  <p>Some do yet endeavor to declare the nature of a ſeparate Inſtrument by the Example of a red hot Iron, which ſets Tow on fire. For they ſay, the Heat of the Iron doth produce fire Inſtrumentally, by virtue of that fire which heated the Iron, and it acts now as its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, no longer conjoyned, but ſeparate therefrom. For that fire which heated the Iron may now be extinguiſhed and put out. But in good truth the hot Iron does not ſet the Tow on fire by a power communicated from the abſent fire, but by the fire which is in the hot Iron having by its ſmal Atomes inſinuated it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>And therefore theſe are words under which no truth is contained,
<note place="margin">Wherein the nature of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument conſiſts.</note> that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Agent tranſmits its action by a virtue derived from it ſelf: but the whol nature of an Inſtrument conſiſts herein, as hath been ſaid, that it produces an effect more noble than it ſelf, and that not like it ſelf, but the Artificer. And this is the common Condition of every Inſtrument. And therefore an Inſtrument cannot be divided into a conjoyned Inſtrument, which acts and operates by ſomthing participated in a ſucceſſive being; and a ſeparate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument which acts by ſomwhat participated inherent therein. For it is the nature of every Inſtrument to operate by ſomwhat participated from the principal Agent in a ſucceſſive being. And as ſoon as that ſucceſſive Influx of the principal cauſe ceaſes, that whol inſtrumental action ceaſes alſo: but that which acts and operates by ſome participated vertue inherent in it ſelf is not an Inſtrument, but operates now as a principal Agent; nor does it act above its own ability, which is eſſential for an Inſtrument to do. In a word, that Agent whoſe Effect anſwers and is equal to a virtue formally inherent in it ſelf, is a principal, not an Inſtrumental Agent; nor is there any Agent in Nature which receives virtue from another thing perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently inherent in it ſelf after the manner of an Inſtrument, or which acts by a vertue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated thereto, and permanently inherent in it ſelf as an Agent <hi>wherewith;</hi> but every thing that ſo acts, acts as the Agent <hi>which,</hi> as the moſt learned <hi>Fienus</hi> rightly ſpeaks to this point. And therefore the Seed alſo ſent forth by a Plant or Animal, becauſe by an implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Vertue though it be no longer governed by another thing it can ſhape the body of a
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:35070:155"/>Plant or Animal, is no Inſtrumental Agent, becauſe it acts not as an Inſtrument; but a principal Agent, becauſe it acts as a principal Cauſe. Now that this Vertue cannot flow from any thing but the Soul implanted in the Seed ſhal be proved hereafter.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>And although (as was ſaid before, Chap. 3.) Authors are here of two Opinions, whiles ſome ſay the Souls of al Living things are communicated by the Generators in the Seed, and others except the Humane Soul: yet it wil be ſufficient if it can be proved in general of Plants and Animals; but whether or no the ſame Reaſons hold good in the generation of Man, and whether the Generation of Man have any thing peculiar, we ſhal conſider in the laſt place.</p>
                  <p>And for out better proceeding we muſt firſt ſay ſomthing of the Nature of Seed,
<note place="margin">What is the Nature of the ſeed</note> and that not as the common faſhion is, of the Seed of Man, but in general of al Seed, inaſmuch as Plants and Animals are propagated thereby. Touching the Nature indeed of Seed there are divers Opinions of Authors, and moſt hold that it is an Excrement. For they ſay that Seed being a thing according to Nature, is either a part of the Body, or an Aliment, or an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement of an Aliment. That it is no part properly ſo called, nor an Aliment of the Body, it is ſo manifeſt that there needs no enquity thereabouts. Therefore they conceive it remains that it muſt be an Excrement. And therefore they ſay that the Seed is the remainder of that Blood which is diſtributed into al the parts of the Body, and can nouriſh al parts; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is voided forth they ſay it is an Excrement. But this reaſoning offends againſt the Laws of Demonſtration; ſince Seed is bred not only in Animals of Blood, but in Plants without Blood; and though the Seed which in Animals is voided forth may in ſome ſort be called an Excrement, yet this does not betide al Seed, viz. the Seed of Plants. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the Seed of Animals is not only the ſuperfluity of Blood, which therefore becauſe it is ſuperfluous (as the Menſtruous Blood is an Excrement) it ought to be expelled, but by a primary Intention of Nature, as a thing moſt neceſſary it is made of the beſt Blood by the Sperm-making Faculty. And therefore in the foregoing Argument there is an inſufficient Enumeration, and beſides the Part, the Aliment, the Excrement, there is a fourth, viz. the Fruit. For the Seed is the Fruit of a living Creature brought forth to that end that its like may thereby be engendred. And therefore <hi>Epicurus</hi> (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> hath it, <hi>de Placitis Philoſophor.</hi>) called it an abſtract of the Body and Soul, and as the Author of Medicinal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions relates, <hi>Zeno Citions</hi> defined the Seed after this manner. The Seed is the Abſtract of a Man, and a Mixture of the Nature of his Progenitors, which a man tranſmits with the moiſt part of his Soul; being ſuch a thing as that from whence it was voided. Yea, and the holy Scriptures teach, That the Earth by the Divine Benediction brought forth the Herb-ſeeding Seed, the Fruit-tree bearing Fruit, and every thing having its ſeed in it ſelf,
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:35070:155"/>according to its kind; where the Fruit and the Seed are one and the ſame thing. And if any man eſteem more of the Authority of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in this point than of the holy Scriptures, let him conſult with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who in 1. <hi>de Generat. Animal. cap.</hi> 18. writes, That the Fruit is either the Seed, or that which contains the Seed in it. And ſince it is manifeſt in Plants, as alſo in Fiſhes and Birds, that the Seed is not ſimply an Excrement, but ſomwhat produced by the Generator, which hath its own peculiar Quantity, Figure, and Conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; why ſhould be Seed be counted an Excrement in other Animals, although it be voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in a liquid and fluid Form; ſince the ſame proceeds from it which proceeds from the Seed of Plants, Fiſhes, and Birds.</p>
                  <p>But if you wil cal the Seed before it goes away and is ſeparated from the Generator a part of the Animal, you ſhal commit no abſurdity. For (which is chiefly manifeſt in Plants) it both cleaves unto the whol Body, and is informed by the ſame Soul whereby the whol Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is informed. Yet becauſe it is generated to that end, not that the Generator may be thereby conſtituted, but that it may be ſeparated from the whol, I conceive it may more fitly be called the Fruit.</p>
                  <p>Seed therefore as it belongs to al living Bodies is a Body formed by the Generator,
<note place="margin">What Seed is.</note> full of inbred heat, profitable to propagate any ſort of Soul; or, it is a Body produced by the Generator, out of which a living Body ariſes of the ſame ſort with that from whence it came. And indeed in the Seed of Plants that ſame innate Heat is in an Oyly and Fatty Form, and hardly in any part of the Plant is there more Oyl than in the Seed: which appears at leaſt hereby, in that from the Seeds of Plants a great quantity of Oyl may be ſtilled and preſſed; as is manifeſt in Line-ſeed, Poppy-ſeed, Hemp-ſeed, Juniper Berries, Almonds, and other ſuch like. In ſuch Animals as breed Eggs 'tis repreſented in the form of an Egg: in ſuch Creatures as bring forth live yong ones the innate Heat is in a ſpirituous form, and therefore it eaſily exhales and is diſſipated, unleſs it be preſently received or conceived by the Womb, and cheriſhed by the warmth thereof.</p>
                  <p>Here nevertheleſs it is to be obſerved that the name of Seed is taken, ſomtimes more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, other whiles more ſtrictly. The Seed is largely taken for al that Body which ſerves for the propagation and generation of a living Creature. But ſtrictly taken it is a moſt ſimple ſubſtance, or a certain ſpirit in which the Soul and Formative Faculty is immediately ſeated, and containing in it ſelf the Idea or Model of that Organical Body from which it is taken, and therefore having in it the Power to Form a Body like to that from whence it was taken, and to perfect it ſelf into an Individual of the ſame ſort with the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator.</p>
                  <p>Now the Seed conſiſts of two Subſtances, the Matter, and the Form. The Matter is that ſame Body or bulk of the Seed, which is various in different Creatures, and of another kind in Plants, and variouſly diſtinguiſhed by the admirable wiſdom of the Creator, according to the Nature of every ſort of living thing; of one faſhion in Fiſhes, another in Birds, another in other Animals. And that matter again conſiſts of two parts, of which one is a thick ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, another ſpiritual, or (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaies) a Spirit and Nature anſwerable to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Stars. And the Spermatick Faculty is as the Form being the Original of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and which hath ſo great a power, that <hi>Plutarch, (de Commun. Notionib.)</hi> ſaies of the Seed, that it is more magnificent and great than that from whence it came, and of which it was bred; and that which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaies in general of Principles, 5. <hi>de generat. Animal. cap.</hi> 7. is chiefly true of the Seed, viz. That Principles though ſmal in bulk, yet are excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great in faculty and ability. Which power of the Seed <hi>Seneca</hi> alſo admires, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Quaeſt. nat. cap.</hi> 6. <hi>Let us conſider</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>what a mighty power ſmal Seeds do ſecretly put forth; and thoſe whoſe ſmalneſs doth hardly take up any room betwixt the joyning of two ſtones, they grow ſo ſtrong as to draw aſunder huge ſtones, and diſſolve the Monuments of the dead.</hi> And <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, in his 26. <hi>Homily upon the Evangeliſts,</hi> writes excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently of the wonderful nature of Seed: Behold! in one grain of the ſmalleſt Seed lies the whol bulk of the Tree that ſhal ſpring therefrom. For let us ſet before our eyes the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Tree, and think with our ſelves what original it had which is grown ſo great; we ſhal doubtleſs find its original to have been a ſmal Seed. And now let us conſider where (in ſo ſmal a grain) lies the ſtrength of the Wood, the roughneſs of the Bark, the greatneſs of the taſt and ſmel, the plenty of Fruits, the greenneſs of Leaves. For if you feel a grain of Seed it is not firm or hard, whence then comes the hardneſs of the Wood? it is not rough, whence then came the roughneſs of the Bark? it is not ſavory, whence then is the taſt of the Fruits? It hath no ſmel, and how then came the Fruits to be ſo fragrant? It hath no greenneſs in it, whence then proceed the greenneſs of the Leaves? All theſe therefore lie hid in the Seed at
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:35070:156"/>one and the ſame time; yet are they not produced out of the Seed al at once. For out of the Seed the Root is produced; out of the Root ſprouts a Branch, out of the Branch grows Fruit, and out of the Fruit is produced Seed again. Let us therefore ad that the Seed alſo lies hid in the Seed.</p>
                  <p>Hence therefore ſome do not unfitly term the Souls Idea's or Patterns, becauſe in them as in a Prototype, the Nature and Fabrick of al Viſible Bodies which they form and ſhape, and of al accidents which they produce in their Bodies, is comprehended.</p>
                  <p>But that the Principal part of the Seed is the Soul, and that therefore the Seed is anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſhal be anon proved by firm Arguments, wherewith a mind deſirous of Truth may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. But becauſe I ſee that moſt men now adaies do not regard ſo much what is true as what is old, it were worth the while to alleadg the Authorities of ancient Philoſophers and Phyſitians; but we have done that already in the beginning of this Chapter. Alſo the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities of Divines (both Greek and Latins) might be produced; but becauſe moſt of them ſpeak only of the Soul of Man, of which we ſhal ſpeak hereafter, it ſhal ſuffice in this place to alleadg only the Authority of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who 2. <hi>de Generat. Animal. c.</hi> 1. thus writes: <hi>All things whatever are made by Nature or by Art are made by that which is actually out of that which is potentially ſuch or ſuch. The Seed therefore is ſuch a thing as hath ſuch a Motion and Principle in it ſelf that the motion being finiſhed every part exiſts, and each part alſo is animated.</hi> And in 2. <hi>Phyſ. cap.</hi> 3. <hi>text.</hi> 31. <hi>The Seed, and the Phyſitian, and he that adviſes with him, and every Efficient, are all of them Cauſes, whence there is a Principle of Mutation, Reſt, or Motion.</hi> And more ſuch like places <hi>Scaliger</hi> produces, <hi>Exercit.</hi> 6. <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. Alſo conſider what follows, out of which it manifeſtly appears that though <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaies the Soul is potentially in the Seed, yet that he holds it is really there. Which appears by the example of a Geometrician ſleeping, waking, contemplating, which he makes uſe of. For as the Geometrician ſleeping and waking hath the power to contemplate, the former a remote power, the latter a neerer power, each of which notwithſtanding pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſes an Act, ſuch as is not in al men, but only in a Geometrician; ſo in a Tree (for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples ſake) in the Winter time when it grows not there is a neer power to grow, becauſe it hath Organs neceſſary to cauſe it to grow already perfect: but in the Seed there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote power, becauſe it is as yet deſtitute of Organs; yet each power pre-ſuppoſes an act, and neither the Seed nor the Tree could be called potentially ſuch, unleſs the Soul were preſent.</p>
                  <p>But it is demanded,
<note place="margin">What Soul is in the Seed.</note> What Soul is in the Seed? <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> indeed ſaies, That the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a living thing is the participation of the firſt Nutritive Soul with the inbred heat. And in 2. <hi>de generat. animal. cap.</hi> 3. he writes, That a Man lives firſt the life of a Plant, then of an Animal, and laſtly of a Man. But this is not ſo to be underſtood as if three Souls came at diſtinct times. For every living thing (even according to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) hath but one Soul, whereby it is that which it is. And therfore in al ſeed whatever there is preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the whol Soul, which nevertheleſs does at firſt form the Inſtruments neceſſary for Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which becauſe it is chiefly and almoſt only conſpicuous in Plants; a man is ſaid to live firſt the life of a Plant. Afterwards in proceſs of time the Inſtruments both of Senſe and Motion are formed in Animals; which being perfected, a Man is then ſaid to live the life of an Animal, and of a Man. For neither (as I alſo ſhewed in <hi>Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Phyſicae, cap.</hi> 1.) the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getative and Senſitive, or the Vegetative, Senſitive, and Rational, are peculiar and general Forms or three Eſſences, but only general Conceptions ariſing and conſtituted from the compariſon and agreement of living things, which exiſt no where ſeparated ſave in the Mind of Man; nor is the Nature of any Plant perfected only by the Vegetative Faculty, but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Plant hath a ſpecifick Form, endued with a vegetative power indeed, but yet with other Faculties alſo.</p>
                  <p>This Opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (and indeed the very Truth) concerning the preſence of the Soul in the Seed moſt excellent Philoſophers and Phyſitians of al Ages have acknowledged, whom I cited in the beginning of this Chapter, and eſpecially <hi>Julius Caeſar Scaliger, Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit.</hi> 6. <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. <hi>et ſequent,</hi> and amongſt later Writers, the moſt learned <hi>Fortunius Licetus,</hi> (who as elſewhere, ſo in <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de ſpont. vivent. ortu, cap.</hi> 32. propounding as it were the Sum of what he had taught elſwhere) writes, That the Seed is an imperfect Animal, and that a Lyon and the Seed of a Lyon are Univocals, and have the ſame Soul for their Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Form, and differ only in the Organization of their Bodies; and <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 74. That the Father then truly generates when he caſts out his Seed, his Soul being parted by partiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its ſubject, and of one being made two; and that which remains in the Seed being che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by the temper of the Womb and obtaining a fit matter exerciſes its Faculties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:35070:156"/>and forms it ſelf a body fitted with thoſe Organs it ſtands in need of, to perform the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther operations of life: ſo that the ſeed is an Animal and living, only wanting a multitude of Organs; and the Fathers generation is not performed in the Womb after the Fathers's death, but when he iſſues out his Seed.</p>
                  <p>But I wil not contend only by Authorities,
<note place="margin">'Tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that Seed is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated.</note> nor is it fitting to begin the proof of this point from the Generation of Man, ſince that were contrary to the Laws of demonſtration. For ſome do not a little involve this point with obſcurities, when they diſpute whether the ſeed be animated, not ſufficiently explaining their mind, whether they underſtand the Seed of Man, of brute Beaſts, or of Plants; [or when they cannot ſatisfie themſelves, but remain doubtful, they affect obſcurity on purpoſe that others may not eaſily underſtand what they think. Leſt therefore any doubt may remain in a matter ſo ſerious, by a Living thing we underſtand a ſubſtance wherein there is a Soul actually, and our Queſtion is whether the ſeed be ſuch a ſubſtance] which they ought by any means to have declared. For there are ſome who wil not grant that any ſeed is actually animated; others that the ſeeds of Plants indeed are animated, but they deny the ſeed of animals eſpecially of Man to be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally animated. But I conceive it moſt probable that al ſeed is animated. And therefore we undertake to prove in general concerning all living things, that their ſeeds are animated. Now thoſe moſt evident and firm and hitherto unanſwered reaſons which have induced moſt renowned Men to be of this Opinion, are theſe. The firſt is this, that the operations of the ſoul are moſt manifeſtly diſcerned in the ſeed. For it is a maxim granted by all Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers; every thing that moves is actually in Being. And theſe three follow one another neceſſarily; to be, to be able, to operate. And therefore Operations bring us to a power, and a power to an Effence. For ſuch powers do flow from the very Eſſence of the ſoul, and they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>eparable from the ſoul, nor do they paſs from one ſubject to another. And as <hi>Fienus</hi> ſpeaks wel, it is ſo abſurd as nothing can be imagined more abſurd, to hold that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, as alſo nutrition and augmentation, which begin with the ſoul it ſelf, do flow from a Principle which is not not vital. Nor can a vital power communicate its Virtue to another thing which is not vital. Since therefore the operations of the ſoul appear in the ſeed, we do thence rightly and neceſſarily conclude, that there is therein a ſoul furniſhed with the powers to exerciſe theſe operations. Now that the ſeed hath Motion and Action is as manifeſt as that which is moſt manifeſt, and ſo often inculcated by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> when he cals the ſeed the Beginning of generation and Motion (1. <hi>de generat. Animal.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 21.) and the Beginning of the Form or Species, which works the Menſtrual Blood into its own proper ſhape. 1. <hi>De generat.</hi> 20. and 4. <hi>de generat.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>Now there are two operations in the ſeed which bring us moſt certainly to the knowledg of the ſoul lying hid,
<note place="margin">The Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Seed. The firſt Vivifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> viz. The quickenning of the ſeed and Conception; and afterwards the ſhaping of all the parts neceſſary for the performance of the vital actions. For in the firſt place, every ſeed (as is manifeſt in Plants) is preſerved by its own ſoul, and for a certain ſeaſon remains fruitful, ſome the ſpace of a year, others two years or more according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of ſorts; and as long as it is perfect and uncorrupted, and hath gotten a fitting place, preſent nutriment and external heat to excite the ſame, it is apt to grow up into a Plant of its own kind. It ſeems indeed an abſurdity to <hi>Libavius</hi> and ſome others, that grains of Wheat lying in the Corn-loft ſhould actually live, but he ſhews no reaſon why it ſhould be abſurd. Contrarily it is more agreeable to reaſon that ſeeds ſhould live. For although in the ſeeds of Plants there is no motion apparent to the ſenſe: yet the ſoul lying hid within is not idle, but it vivifies the ſeed: after the ſame manner as in Trees in the Winter time no action appears to ſenſe, and yet they are not deſtitute of their ſoul, but are enlivened by the ſame concealed within them, which in the ſpring time by manifeſt actions does again diſcover it ſelf; and the ſame happens in ſeeds. For Seeds whiles they live are fruitful and fit to be ſowed; but thoſe which are dead are not fit to be ſowed, nor wil any Plant ſpring from them.

For if there be any work in nature admirable, and wherein we muſt be fain to acknowledg our own Ignorance and to admire the infinite Wiſdom and Power of the Creator, it is the ſhaping of the Child in the Womb, the Chick in the Egg, and the Body of a Plant out of the ſeed thereof. For who does not admire that the Bodies of Plants and Animals are ſo artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally framed, and in reſpect of Magnitude, Number, Figure, Order, Scituation, Colour, Smel, and other things, ſo formed, as to tranſcend all the Art and Iuduſtry of all the Artificers

For in that he would adorn all things with convenient furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſuffer nothing to be deprived of his benefits that I count as a token of moſt perfect Goodneſs; and in this reſpect his Goodneſs muſt be celebrated by us with Hymnes. But to have invented all this, how and after what manner every thing ſhould be adorned, is a point of the higheſt Wiſdom; and to have been able to bring to paſs al that he pleaſed, is an argument of an invincible and unconquerable Virtue and Power. Thou muſt not therefore ſo admire the Sun, Moon, and univerſal order of the other Stars, being ſo exceeding artificially mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhalled &amp; diſpoſed; nor let their Greatneſs, Beauty, perpetual Motion, or ſo certainly deſcribed Circuits render thee ſo aſtoniſhed as to think theſe ſublunary things mean in compariſon, and void of all ornament. For here alſo you ſhal find a like Wiſdom, Power, and Providence. For do but conſider the matter whereof every thing is made, and do not vainly perſwade thy ſelf, that of menſtrual Blood and Seed an immortal Creature could be made, or one that is impaſſible, or alwaies movable, or as bright and fair as the Sun. But as you eſtimate the Art of</hi> Phidias, <hi>ſo conſider the Art of the Maker of all things. But you may perhaps be aſtoniſhed at the wonderful Ornaments of the Statue of</hi> Jupiter Olympius, <hi>the bright Ivory, the ſtore of Gold, the largeneſs of the whol Image. But if you ſhould ſee ſuch an one of Clay, you wil paſs by the ſame it may be with contempt.

For a vulgar and unskilful Eye is aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed at the richneſs of the matter, but an Artiſt is only amazed at the Beauty of the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip. Come on therefore, be thou a skilful Naturaliſt, that we may not term thee a rude Plebeian but a true Philoſopher. Leave the difference of matters, and conſider the bare Art it ſelf. When thou obſerveſt the Fabrick of the Eye, think that it is the Inſtrument of Seeing, and when thou vieweſt the Foot, think that it is the Organ of Walking. But if thou thinkeſt of Eyes made of the ſubſtance of the Sun, and of Feet made of pure Gold, thou forgetteſt the matter which is Bones, and Skin, and Fleſh, whereof they are made. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring that therefore conſider whether light be an Heavenly Subſtance, or an Earthly Slime: for ſo give me leave to call the Mothers Blood flowing into the Womb. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you give</hi> Phidias <hi>Clay to make an Image of, you wil never require of him an Ivory Statue; after the ſame manner having given Blood to the Work-maſter, you cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from him a Sun, or a Moon, or ſuch a bright and beautiful Body. For thoſe Bodies are divine and Heavenly, and we but Statues or Images of Clay, and yet the Art of the Work-maſter is equal in both.</hi> So far <hi>Galen.</hi>

(I will give you the whol place) and thus he ſaies. <hi>Is it not ſuperadmirable that of a ſmal Seed (taken from ſome Herb or Tree) caſt into the Earth, a green Herb ſhould ſpring up, or a Tree, and that the ſame in proceſs of time drawing its nouriſhment out of the bowels of the Earth ſhould joyn to it ſelf its juſt quantity, and fit all its parts according to the condition of its own Nature, with ſo beautiful a variety, ſo comely a diſpoſition, and ſo admirable an order that the wit of Man is not able to comprehend the Workmanſhip that is in one ſmal Herb? For conſider as a Tree grows up from the Seed, how it ſends its Roots into the Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, and fixes them ſo faſt, makes them ſtick ſo cloſe in the bowels of the Earth that after a little time it can hardly be ſtirred or plucked up without great violence; how it ſends its Stock and Trunk upwards, which outwardly it cloaths with Bark as with a Coat, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the inclemency of the Air, and the injuries of cold and heat. And in the inmoſt part the marrow is placed, and round about Veins great and ſmal are diſperſed through the body of the whol Trunk; and they in an admirable order ſpringing, the leſſer from the greater, through which all parts draw nouriſhment to themſelves. And in the upper part how wonderfully do the Leaves ſpring out of the Branches, wherein alſo we behold a wonderful Connexion of Veins and Arteries. Alſo the Leaves have all the ſame ſhape, the ſame ſmoothneſs or roughneſs, a like longitude and latitude well-neer, the ſame color, taſt, and ſmel; and in every reſpect Trees of the ſame kind are exceedingly one like another. I paſs over the beauty of the Flowers, the ſweetneſs of the Fruits, and in both a wonderful Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice And all theſe Originally ſpring from the Vertue of one Seed. And in the Seed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of a living thing, and conſequently of a Man (out of which the Child grows as to its Body) is not that alone exceeding wonderful, that by reaſon of the Vertue which is inſo exceeding vile altogether deformed and filthy matter, ſuch a decency of Members, ſo beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful a compoſition, ſo convenient an order, ſo effectual a diſpoſition of Members, ſo rare a conjunction of parts ſhould ariſe? namely, That beneath a broad part ſhould be ſhaped upon which the whol body might firmly ſtand, and move from place to place; the extream part whereof ſhould have a manifold dvviſion, ſo that the matter ſhould be carved as it were into particles, viz. That the Feet ſhould have Toes, and that theſe parts again ſhould have ſuch an order that that which is in the firſt place ſhould be longer and thicker than the reſt, and ſo to proceed gradually, as that the laſt Toe is of all the ſmalleſt and the ſhorteſt. Likewiſe, That theſe parts at the end of the foot ſhould be ſo regularly and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally five in number, that he is counted for a Monſter that hath ſix. Alſo that each of theſe parts hath its joynts wherein they may be bowed, and the firſt and greateſt hath only one joynt in the middle, the reſt every one two. And all theſe things are manifeſtly apparent in the compoſition of the Foot and Hand to him that ſhall look no further than the out ſide. And in the uppermoſt Part of the Body, how there is framed with rare Artifice a round part, which is covered above with the Skull, of ſo hard and indiſſolvable a boney ſubſtance that lying many yeers together in the Earth it cannot be conſumed. Which Skul is covered with fleſh and skin, whence flow the Hairs which cloath the part all over. But under this Skul is formed a certain noble and moſt tender ſubſtance which we term the Brain, and that in ſeveral parts variouſly formed that in might be a ſit receptacle for divers Vertues, and the Organ of ſundry noble Operations. In which upper round part the Eyes alſo are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, beautifully formed in their ſockets, yet ſo as they might be moſt readily moved, which alſo have their Eyelids and Eyebrows. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder theſe the Noſtrils, and on the ſides the Ears; and under the Noſtrils the Mouth-hole to receive the Meat, and round about the Jaw-bones ful of Teeth; the foremoſt of which at the entrance are thin and ſharp to cut and mince the Meat, but the hinder are more than twice as thick, which like Mill-ſtones grind what the other hath cut into ſmal particles, in which regard they are alſo called Grinders. But on the back-ſide of the Head all is ſhut up, and no opening to be ſeen: but there are ſtrong Nerves, and wonderful Joynts which faſten the Head (the upmoſt part) to the Sboulders beneath, ſo that though the Head do not touch the Shoulders, yet it is beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſupported by them without burden by interpoſition of the Neck. And hence from the Shoulders (as it were two Boughs) the Arms are ſtretched out for the performance of any work, which in the middeſt (namely the Elbow) are made to bend, and have their utmoſt parts orderly divided into Fingers, as was ſaid before of the Feet. Moreover that ſame moſt noble member the Heart is ſo wonderfully ſeated in the middeſt of the Body, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Lungs placed round about to fan and temper its heat, drawing the Air continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in by their reſpiration like a pair of Bellows, and ſo tempering its Heat: alſo having the

And have not we had reaſon in the Preface of this Book to aver that Men carry Miracles alwaies about them more wonderful than al the Miracles in the World beſides? And truly it would not ſeem ſo great a wonder if we ſhould aver, That God by his Omnipotent Power of himſelf did frame all this connexion and diſpoſition of Members which we ſee in our ſelves.

And although <hi>Galen</hi> deſpaired to find the cauſe by which al theſe things are done, and confeſſes that he could find nothing ſo much as probable in this point, which made him exceeding ſad, <hi>Lib. de foetu formato, cap.</hi> 6. Yet if he had conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that theſe Operations were proper to the Soul of every ſort of living Creature, he might without great difficulty have known that al theſe operations did proceed from the Soul which lies hid in the Seed.</p>
                  <p>That theſe are the Operations of nothing but the Soul of every living thing, he wil eaſily underſtand who conſiders what it is which of a ſmal Birth makes a large Animal, preſerves in Nutrition the ſame Figure of the Body, leſt by the continual growth of the parts it ſhould be changed, reſtores the fleſh loſt, breeds oftentimes large Veins. Which <hi>Galen</hi> ſaies he ſaw in the Head of one, <hi>Lib. de ſemine,</hi> repairs the teeth which yong people do caſt, reſtores every year the fallen Leaves of Trees, brings forth the Flowers and Fruit, in Peacocks and other Birds ſupplies new Feathers ſuitable to their kinds. For ſince it is certain, that the Soul and form of every ſort of living thing is the ſpecifick cauſe of al theſe operations, and that hence every yeer each Tree hath its own Leaves reſtored, of one faſhion to the Oak, of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Pear-tree, of another to the Peach-tree, and Harts-horns to the Hart in room of thoſe are fallen off, but not the Horns of an Ox, Claws of a Crab, every one according as ſuits with their particular Nature: What need is there I pray you in the firſt ſtructure of every living thing out of its Seed, to ſeek any other cauſe of Formation than the Soul it ſelf, which is one and the ſame in the Seed, and in the living body formed? For it is altogether the ſame work, when the Soul lying hid in the Seed, and drawing matter, ſhapes the body of a Plant, and when the ſame Soul repairs the fallen Leaves, reſtores the Flowers, produces new branches, boughs, and roots. And ſo ſince the ſame operations in the Seed, and in the Plant, are ſeen in every reſpect abſolutely perfect, they ſhew that there is the ſame Principle and Agent in both. And therefore ſince in the ſeed it ſelf are perſormed the operations proper to the ſoul, why ſhould we deny the ſoul to be in the ſeed? For al the faculties of every form, and eſpecially of the ſoul, are properties inſeparably flowing therefrom, and therefore it may be moſt rightly concluded; Where the faculties and operations of the Soul are found,
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:35070:158"/>there the Soul alſo it ſelf is preſent, and we eaſily come by the operations to the knowledg of the hidden Eſſence and Soul. For if one Faculty were in the Seed, another in the grown body, of what form was that the power, or when went it away, and whither, when the body was formed? It is an abſurd thing truly to hold, that the Formation of the Fleſh, Membranes, Bones, and other parts, is begun by one faculty, and continued and perfected by another different therefrom; and that ſo as to continue the work begun with the ſame thred without any Error. Doubtleſs one and the ſame continued Operation, which laſts from the Beginning of Generation to the end of Life, cannot proceed from divers Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
                  <p>This alſo confirms the ſame that in Plants we ſee a Root, or Branch, or alſo a Leaf only, as in the Indian Fig-tree, being pluckt from the Plant and ſtuck in the ground, does grow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a compleat and perfect Plant; which is the work of nothing but the Soul preſent therein. And ſince the ſame thing is done in the Seed, we juſtly conclude that the Soul is preſent and therein, and performs the ſame work. Yea, and when we ſee the ſame Plant (as Roſema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for example) propagated both from a Seed and Branch we acknowledg the ſame cauſe in both caſes. For otherwiſe there would be two different cauſes of one ſpecial effect, and two conforming Facukies of one and the ſame Plant, which is falſe and abſurd.</p>
                  <p>To anſwer this Argument, <hi>Fienus</hi> (truly) labors and ſweats hard, <hi>de from. foet. quaeſt.</hi> 5.

                     <hi>Concluſ.</hi> 6. but yet in vain. For he ſaies that a new Plant is produced one way out of the Root and Branches, another way out of the Seed. For of the former a new Plant is not made, but they being ſevered from their ſtem are themſelves a new Plant; becauſe being cut from the whol they have already a vegetative ſoul multiplied, but do not acquire the ſame, by which they augment themſelves and attain to their perfection. Contrariwiſe, that the Seed is no new Plant, becauſe it hath no ſoul, but it becomes a new Plant by the coming of a ſoul into it after it is planted in the Earth; or by the ſoul which is newly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the ſeed after it is put into the Earth.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Fienus</hi> can by no means thus free himſelf. For in the firſt place, though it ſeem ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner of propagation to the ſenſe, that which is by the Root or Branch, from that which is by the Seed: yet in reſpect of the principal Efficient it is indeed one and the ſame, ſince it proceeds from the ſame ſoul. <hi>Fienus</hi> denies indeed (by reaſon of a pre-conceived Opinion) that the ſoul of the Plant is in the ſeed, but he proves it by no reaſon. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, from the operations of the Formative Faculty which are in both alike we firmly conclude the ſame ſoul to be in both, viz. in the Seed (for examples ſake of Roſemary) and in the Branch thereof. Moreover in the ſame ſence, as a Root, a Branch or a Leaſ may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a new Plant, the Seed may alſo be ſo called. For in each there is its Soul, but in the Seed there is wanting the ultimate perfection ſpringing from the Organs. Thirdly, if he grants the whol ſoul may be in the Slip of a Root, and in one Leaf of a Tree, and that by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the ſoul is multiplied, and that the ſoul which before was but one in number, viz. while the ſaid Root, or Branch, or Leaf did grow to the Plant, by cutting the ſame off is multiplied; why does he not grant that the ſame multiplication may be made by the ſeed? eſpecially ſince al ſeeds are rarely faſhioned, and ſome of them have a more artificial ſhape than the Root of an Hop or any other Plant, or the Leaf of an Indian Fig-tree? The ſame Operations in both do argue (doubtleſs) the preſence of the ſame Soul in both.</p>
                  <p>We do therefore rightly argue from this wonderful Fabrick of the Body which is made in and of the ſeed, that the ſoul is preſent therein. For, <hi>whatſoever is made by Nature or by Art muſt be made by that which hath an actual Being; and that which moves muſt have an actual Being;</hi> and every immediate efficient Cauſe muſt neceſſarily be joyned with the Patient. And therefore in the generation alſo of al living things that which forms the Body muſt be preſent, and muſt be joyned to that Body. And that which is yet more, the miniſtring powers themſelves which wait upon the Formative Faculty do al appear in the ſeed. For the firſt Operation which is performed in the Seed is in a Plant the drawing of nouriſhment from the Earth, and in Animals the drawing of the Mothers blood. The ſecond is the Vivification and Animation thereof, or Communication of the Soul thereto. For the Nutriment drawn out of the Earth is inanimate, and the blood alſo is of it ſelf inanimate. But when of theſe the parts of a Plant and of a Child are made, they muſt needs then be ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated. But nothing can give a Soul but that which hath it, and therefore the Seed is animated. The third Operation is the ſeparative. Since the Liver is made of one kind of matter, the Stomach of another, the Heart of another, the Brain of another; a Vein, a Nerve, an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of another, the Soul in the Seed diſcerns and ſeparates theſe matters one from another.
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:35070:159"/>Fourthly, when theſe matters are ſevered by the ſame Soul each is put in its own place, the Brain and Stomach in one place, the Heart and Liver in another. The fift is the Formative peculiarly ſo called, by which its own ſhape, quantity, number, and the like, are allotted to each part.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,

So in the Spring, when a Plant ſprings from ſeed, the Plant which bare that ſeed is many times dead long before; and whiles the Animal is in the Womb of the female receiving its ſhape, the Male which ingendred the ſame may happen to be dead.</p>
                  <p>Again,
<note place="margin">The innate Heat in the Seed is not the Principle of confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note> Neither can the inbred Heat of the Seed be the Cauſe of Formation. For though it cannot be denied, that the innate Heat is an Organ wherewith as other actions in the body, ſo conformation is ſhaped, yet it is not the primary Cauſe; ſince ſo admirable a work can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be aſcribed to a bare quality, as to give to ſo many different parts almoſt infinite in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, each its peculiar figure, quantity number, ſcituation; but there is need of a far Diviner Agent. Of which <hi>Scaliger, Exercitat.</hi> 6. <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. <hi>If</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>the form comes from without (as they tel us) and in the mean while the matter is furniſhed with al kinds of perfection; of neceſſity both the Qualities and Quantities, the numbers, orders, and ſcituations, muſt be provided and ordered by ſomwhat which is within, and in concluſion the whol Body muſt be ſhaped by the ſame internal Principle. Now this ſhaping of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is performed, either by a ſubſtance, or by an accident, or by both. Not by an accident alone. Firſt of all, becauſe no accident works but in the vertue of its ſubſtance. Again, becauſe no accident hath knowledg. But that ſame Vertue and Power which is Architect of ſo noble a Temple hath been judged by all Philoſophers to be moſt exceeding wiſe. It muſt be therefore framed and built by a ſubſtance. And this ſubſtance is the Form of the Seed. Doubtleſs the form of the Seed if it be not a Soul it is a bruit thing: and if it frame the body, it is equal to the Soul. But in growing and reſtoring of waſted Fleſh the ſoul it is which does all. There muſt be therefore in the Seed a ſhaping Soul which comes before that Soul for which it prepares its houſe. And therefore that former Soul is more wiſe and noble than this latter.</hi> And a little before: <hi>The Form it ſelf is the cauſe of this prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For it both alters the whol, and diſpoſes of the parts for its ownuſe. Nor when the body arrives to the perfection of its preparation, does it then alſo arrive to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Form. For the Form it ſelf exiſts before-hand. And therefore there is no progreſs made to it, but to its act, that there may afterwards be uſe made thereof.</hi>

                  <p>Nor in Animals can the Vertue of the Mothers Womb be the cauſe of the Conformation and ſhaping of the Body.
<note place="margin">The vertue of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Womb is not the Cauſe of the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the yong one.</note> For if the Formative Faculty were in the Womb, and not in the Seed, the Father ſhould confer nothing to the Conformation of the yong one, and ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford only a paſſive Principle, and conſequently ſhould not generate. Again, there can be no cauſe aſſigned why the Child ſhould be ſomtimes like the Father, and why Females ſhould not alwaies be ingendred. Thirdly, in Eg-bearing Animals the Conformation is not performed by the Womb, but the Eggs are perfected into Chicken, without the Body of the Hen; as neither the Earth (which to Plants is as the Womb) hath any power to ſhape the Plant, but al that Faculty is in the Seed. Moreover, if heat brings (as they ſay) the power of the Seed into act, a Quality engenders a ſubſtance. Nor can they avoid the force of this Argument who anſwer, That this ſubſtantial Power is ſo ordered and diſpoſed by the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerator, that the ſaid Quality being awakened it breaks forth into an act like the Generator. For what I pray you is that ſubſtantial power? Certainly unleſs it be the Soul it is a meer figment, which appears by their own rule, when they ſay that the next power is reckoned for an act. For ſince a thing cannot be at once both in act and power, if the next power be an act, certainly it cannot be a pure paſſive power, but a formal one, and ſo the Soul it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Nor is that of any moment which <hi>Thomas Fienus</hi> brings againſt this argument,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of</hi> Fienus <hi>againſt the preſence of the ſoul in the ſeed.</hi>

For ſeeing he grants that there is no other cauſe of the Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of an animat Body ſave the Soul, it is rightly hence concluded; That whatever hath in it the Efficient Cauſe of Formation hath in it the Soul: But the ſeed hath in it the cauſe of the Conformation of an animate Body. <hi>Ergo</hi> it hath in it the Soul. Here indeed <hi>Fienus</hi> anſwers; <hi>I acknowledge the Premiſes are true; but I deny the Conſequence. It is indeed rightly inferred that there is ſome Soul in the Seed, but not that it is the Soul of the Seed. There is indeed a Soul brought into the Seed after that the Seed is conceived in the Womb, or planted in the Earth, or the Eg is ſet under the Hen, when al things are put into act; but
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:35070:159"/>that is not the Soul of the Seed, or which did pre-exiſt in the Seed, or which was bred in the Stones, the Tree, or the Hen, but the Soul of the young Conception which was afterward introduced thereinto.</hi> But in very good deed, how can the Conſequent be denied if both the Premiſes be true? For in a Syllogiſm, that which is falſe cannot be inferred from true Premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. He ſaies nevertheleſs that the Minor is falſe, and he denies that the ſoul which is the Cauſe of Conformation is the ſoul of the ſeed: but falſely. For it muſt be ſhewed, as hereafter ſhal be ſaid, what is the cauſe of thoſe operations and of the conformation in the ſeed before the ſoul is come, according to his opinion. Moreover ſince he ſaies the ſoul is not preſent til all things be actuated, he ought to ſhew what is the Author of that ſame actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and conformation, in Plants, Eggs, Bruit Beaſts, before the ſoul comes. Thirdly he ought to have told us, whether the Souls alſo of Plants, Birds, and Beaſts, are introduced, and from what cauſe they proceed. Doubtleſs when ſome Seed is caſt into the Earth, or in any place is moiſtened with water (without any other cauſe) firſt it puts forth a Root, and a little after it begins to ſprout. What I pray you is the cauſe of this operation and formation, ſave the Soul already pre-exiſtent in the Seed? Or if it be not the Soul pre-exiſtent in the Seed, Let <hi>Fienus</hi> ſhew whence it ſhould afterwards come.</p>
                  <p>And this Argument which hath hitherto been propounded and explained, drawn from the operations of the Soul appearing in the Seed might alone ſuffice to perſwade a mind not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacious, but deſirous of truth, that the Soul is in the Seed: howbeit there are other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments evident enough to prove the ſame.</p>
                  <p>For in the ſecond place,
<note place="margin">Like would not beget its like, if the Seed were not anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</note> whatſoever ingenders its like muſt needs communicate its Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the thing ingendred; otherwiſe it would not be eſſentially like it. But every living Creature begets its like, <hi>Ergo</hi> it communicates its Eſſence to the thing ingendred; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently not only the matter, but alſo the form, whereby the Eſſence of a thing is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accompliſhed. And if this were not ſo there could be no univocal Generation, and the Generator could give nothing but the matter, nor could any man tel us whence the Soul ſhould come; when frequently the Generator before a Plant or Animal is made of the Seed may come to die, and afterward nothing ſhould be found to form the Plant or Animal ſave external Heat. Thus the Seeds and bulbous Roots of Plants are ſomtimes kept many yeers before any Plant grow therefrom, the Plant which bate the Seed or Bulb being long ſince dead. So out of an Egg even by the Heat of a Furnace a Chick is hatched, the Cock and Hen from whoſe copulation the Egg proceeded, being long ſince kil'd and eaten. And que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſs if there were not in the Seed an active Principle communicated by the Parents, the Parents could not be truly ſaid to generate, ſince they ſhould afford only the Matter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thomas Fienus</hi> indeed makes anſwer, <hi>de Format. Foet. quaeſt.</hi> 6. that the Parents do herein really and actively generate, in that they afford the Seed and Matter of Generation, and imprint thereupon all diſpoſitions neceſſary for the Introduction of a Soul. But this is the Begging of the Queſtion. For we deny that <hi>that</hi> which only affords the matter of Generation however diſpoſed to fit it for the reception of the form, does communicate an active principle and truly Generate. For all theſe diſpoſitions do belong to the matter, and he that does not communicate the principle of acting, he cannot be ſaid actively to ingender.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If the Seed had no Soul in it,
<note place="margin">A Thing Inanimate cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender that which is Animate.</note> and yet ſhould produce a Creature with a Soul in it, the more noble ſhould be produced by the leſs noble, and the Virtue of the Seed ſhould produce a Subſtance, which is abſurd. For nothing acts beyond its ability; alſo that which is not animated ſhould perform actions proper to the Soul, Conformation, Nutriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Auction, Attraction; ſhould make Bones, Fleſh, Membranes: all which actions are performed at the firſt conformation, which happens ſoon after the Beginning of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>
                  <p>And though it be objected by ſome, that an Agent by virtue of another thing may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an effect more noble than of it ſelf it were able to compaſs: yet if this be done, it muſt be done when the principal Agent is preſent, and not when it is abſent, which does not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in generation. For the Father may be abſent from the place where Generation is made, yea and he may be dead before that time. So alſo the Mother may be abſent or dead, as it happens in Chickens, which are hatched by the Heat of a Furnace, or by ſome Fowl of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſort.</p>
                  <p>All the Premiſes therefore being conſidered, it is moſt rightly determined,
<note place="margin">How Live things are generated.</note> that the ſoul it ſelf is in the ſeed, and as <hi>Zabarella</hi> wel ſaies <hi>de Facult. Anim. cap.</hi> 11. that Living things when they generate their like do communicate ſome of their Matter and ſome of their Form, when they afford an animated ſeed furniſhed with the ſame vital faculty which was in the Generator.</p>
                  <pb n="486" facs="tcp:35070:160"/>
                  <p> For though the Souls of living things of themſelves have no Quantity nor are diviſible:
<note place="margin">Souls are co-exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise.</note> yet according to the extenſion of the matter wherein they are they themſelves are extended, which <hi>Fortunius Licetus</hi> hath proved in two Book <hi>de Animae Coextenſione Corpori,</hi> and when it is divided they are divided, or rather multiplied, and yet they themſelves are neither greater nor leſs than they were. So the Soul which is in a ſmal Twig that firſt ſhoots out of the Earth, is no leſs than that which is afterward in a tall Oak; nor is the Soul of a Calf leſs than that of an Ox. After the ſame manner the Soul diffuſes it ſalf into the Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is newly adjoyned to the Body, and ſo according to the extenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Body which it informs it ſelf is extended, and yet becomes not greater than it was: as on the Contrary, when a Branch is pluckt from a Tree, the Soul of the Tree is not made leſs than it was. After the ſame manner it is in Generation. For whereas before a Plant generates the ſoul is but one in number, becauſe it is but in one ſubject: yet now that the Plant generates ſeed, viz. ſuch a matter as wherein the ſoul which was before in one numerical ſubject may now be multiplied in its exiſtence; &amp; that Seed being ripe is ſeparated from the Plant: in each ſeed though never ſo ſmal the ſoul remains entire, and now it lives by its own ſoul and ſubſiſts by it ſelf; and ſince of one Plant of Poppy more than an hundred ſeeds are bred, the ſame ſoul of the Poppy exiſts entire in each ſeed; and then the Soul is ſaid to multiply it ſelf: which when it doth, it becomes no leſſer than it was; ſince of it ſelf it hath no Quantity.</p>
                  <p>But which way the ſoul it ſelf remaining entire can communicate its Eſſence to another,
<note place="margin">How the Soul mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplies it ſelf.</note> this is that which hath perplexed great Wits, and not being underſtood hath raiſed many diſputes and bred many Errors. For <hi>Jul. Caeſar Scaliger</hi> ſaies rightly concerning the Soul, <hi>Exercit.</hi> 307. <hi>ſect.</hi> 29. <hi>We ſee the ſhallowneſs of our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings. Who dares ſay he comprehends the ſpecies of ſubſtances? We cannot attain to that exquiſite knowledg, how of two things one is made; how the Form is totally in the whol Body, and totally in every part. So divine a thing is the Form, that being a ſubſtance it fils another ſubſtance ful of it ſelf, ſo that of both one is made. Therefore to enquire further is the part of an over curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and buſie mind; for it is a part of humane Wiſdome to be contentedly ignorant of ſome things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But chiefly that queſtion hath much troubled many,
<note place="margin">Whether the ſoul be diviſible.</note> whether the Soul he totally in the whol Body, and totally in every part thereof: alſo how the Soul is diviſible, whether in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of its extenſion by means of the Body. Where ſome hold that all the Souls of perfect Animals (and they only) are indiviſible and unextended: others hold that all the ſouls of perfect Animals are diviſible and extended, only the rational Soul of man excepted. But the Conimbricenſian Collegiates do hold both theſe Opinions to be very probable, and therefore they anſwer the Arguments brought to prove both, and ſo leave the Reader unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved: yet they confeſs they had rather maintain the former. <hi>Fortunius Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Hence alſo another controverſie hath riſen,
<note place="margin">How ſouls are co-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened with the Body:</note> how in the Augmentation of the parts of the Bodies of Animals which grow the growing parts do receive the Soul; which is attended with exceeding great difficulties, as <hi>Zabarella</hi> alſo confeſſes, and is ſo obſcure, that it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Sebaſtianus Baſſo</hi> (a man otherwiſe quick-ſighted enough in the things of nature) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that there is any ſuch thing as a ſubſtantial form, and abſurdly to hold that the form in a body natural is nothing but a certain collection of particles of the ſame kind into an excellent kind of Harmony. Now among others, <hi>Jacobus Zabarella</hi> hath written largely of this Queſtion, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Accretione,</hi> where having in Chap. 13. recited contrary Opinions, and rightly rejected the Opinion of <hi>Scotus</hi> and others, who hold that the Soul flows with the matter, and that in the parts of the matter bred of the Aliment particles of the Soul are bred, and that ſo juſt the ſame ſoul does not laſt during the life of the Animal; and had undertaken to defend the other Opinion, that the Soul all the Life time remains the ſame in number, and when new matter comes is extended to inform the ſame, Chap. 16. he propounds two very urgent doubts againſt the ſame: The firſt is, That after this manner, when the Soul which is in the old fleſh paſſes over to inform the Fleſh newly compoſed of Nutriment, the Form ſeems to go out of one ſubject into another, which ſeems to be abſurd. The other is, That thus the Soul wil ſeem to be movable of it ſelf; whereas <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the 6. <hi>Phyſic.</hi> teaches, that Bodies only are of themſelves movable; and that the Soul is movable only by accident according to the motion of the Body, in 1. <hi>de Anima.</hi> But <hi>Zabarella</hi> rightly anſwers to the firſt, that the Form in this manner does not totally forſake his ſubject but remains therein, yet paſſes over to inform new matter, which tranſition, or diffuſion wants a proper name.
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:35070:160"/>And to the Second; That the Soul does not paſs over to inform new matter by motion, but after a certain manner to us hid and unknown. Which things although <hi>Baſſo</hi> does laugh at, yet if rightly explained they are moſt true. Al the Errors which many run into in this point do proceed from hence, becauſe they attribute ſuch things to the Form and Soul as belong only to the Body, viz. Quantity, Diviſibility, and parts. But that which <hi>Scaliger</hi> writes concerning the motion of Angels, <hi>Exercit.</hi> 359. <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. is alſo true or the Soul;

For in ſuch things truly in which the Seminal Principle is ſpred al the body over, as in a Willow, the Soul is multiplied by cutting off a branch, or as they commonly ſpeak, is divided: but in Animals where Propagation is made by Seed the ſoul temains intire in its body, though a part of the body be cut off; as alſo in growing, although the ſoul communicates it ſelf to the parts added to the body, yet it does not paſs out of one ſubject into another.

But if an hundred, or a thouſand, or more men come, or a thouſand Glaſſes be ſet, the ſame image which was before received by one Man and by one Glaſs, does now appear in a thouſand Men, and a thouſand Looking-glaſſes; nor yet is the Species or Repreſentation of that viſible Object divided into Quantitative parts.</p>
                  <p>And hence aroſe that famous Axiome of Philoſophers;
<note place="margin">Every form can multiply it ſelf:</note> That every Form multiplies it ſelf.

                  <p>Now this multiplication is performed divers waies, as ſhal be ſaid hereafer.

Al four-footed Beaſts do communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their Souls by their ſeed; Birds, Serpents, and Inſects ſome of them, do bring forth Eggs, or ſomwhat analogical to Eggs, and by them they multiply themſelves. In Plants there is a various manner of Propagation, as ſhal alſo be ſaid hereafter. For ſome propagate themſelves by Seed, ſome by Branches, ſome by a Root or Bulb, and ſome by divers of theſe waies. For it is not in them as in Animals, where the Soul is tied to the ſeed, or to ſomwhat which anſwers the Seed, but it is diffuſed through the whol Plant, or through its parts, ſo that it can multiply it ſelf by any part if it be put into the ground, ſo that thence a new Plant wil ariſe. Nor are the Souls nevertheleſs diviſible in Plants although it be common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo ſaid; ſince they have not one part without another, but the body of the Plant only is divided, and is made leſs by cutting off ſome bough, branch, or Root: nor does it give part of it ſelf to the Seed, the Branch, the Root, but its whol ſelf, and ſo multiplies it ſelf.</p>

And ſo the Seed wants only that perfection which belongs to the Body and the ſtructure of its parts, but not that which belong unto the So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>. Nor can we argue in perfect Plants from the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the ſecond act, to the negation of the firſt, as may be ſeen in Trees and other Plants which laſt all the Winter, in which there is no manifeſt operation: and yet the Soul is really preſent in them.</p>
                  <p>Again, Thoſe actions which proceed from the Soul are twofold, Organical or Second, which are performed in a perfect Body, and Prince or Inorganical, viz, the Vegetation of the Seed, the Formation of the Body, with its nutrition and augmentation. For as ſoon as the Body begins to be formed, it begins to be nouriſhed. And although the Seed in the Corn-loſt be not nouriſhed, yet it hath a Vegetative and Nutritive faculty: after the ſame manner as Plants pluckt up are likewiſe not nouriſhed, yet are really animated, and being tranſplanted into another ſoil they are again nouriſhed.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The force of Nature, whence it is.</note> is, that the Vegetative faculty being void of Wiſdom and reaſon ſeems unable to perform ſo wonderful a work, wherein the greateſt Art and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom appears, and which cannot be done but by a moſt wiſe and powerful Artiſt. But no man wil wonder at this who knows that the Soul is the Principle and immediate cauſe of theſe operations, but yet that it hath not its power from it ſelf, but hath received the ſame from the moſt wiſe and powerful Creator; whence alſo <hi>Scaliger Exercitat.</hi> 188. <hi>&amp;</hi> 359. <hi>ſect.</hi> 11. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines Nature to be the ordinary power of God, and in <hi>Theophraſt. de Cauſis Plant. cap.</hi> 1. the power of God in the ſecond cauſes, to which himſelf hath preſcribed certain rules to act by.

Nature is nothing but that ſame command or God by which all things are what they are, and perform that which they are commanded.

The Elements are moved in a ſtraight perpendicular Line, upwards and downwards, although they know not what a perpendicular Line is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath commanded them ſo to do.</p>
                  <p>A third thing which hath moved many is this;
<note place="margin">Whether the ſoul cannot be but-in an organical Body.</note> That they conceive nothing can be the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Soul but an Organical Body, [being moved thereto by <hi>Ariſtotle's</hi> definition, who defines the ſoul to be the act of an Organical body. But <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> did not define the ſoul ſimply conſidered in its Eſſence, but in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>or it ſelf, it muſt needs at firſt be in an inorganical
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:35070:162"/>Body.] But that an organical Body is not neceſſary to receive the Soul into, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things do ſhew. For in the firſt place, ſince to an organical conſtitution is required a certain Quantity, Number, Figure and ſcituation of parts; all theſe things are not neceſſary for the reception of Forms. For Forms (ſuch as ſouls are) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of themſelves no quantity, are received into matter without Quantity or Figure. And this we ſee manifeſtly in Plants, in which the Quantity and Figure are variouſly changed the ſame ſoul remaining. For the Quantity and Form of a Branch ſpringing up from a Seed is one, and of the ſame grown to a tall Tree, another. The ſtalks of many die in the Winter, the Root remaining alive, and in it the Soul. Again, the figure of bodies is an Effect of the Forms and Souls. And therefore it is not a previous diſpoſition foregoing them.
<note place="margin">The Form deteamines the Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities and Figures.</note> For the Form it ſelf is that which determines the Quantity of its own body, and each Soul brings in a determinate Figure into its own Body, and preſerves the ſame in Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition and Augmentation; hence there are ſo many figures and magnitudes of living bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies as there are differences of ſouls, and a Roſe hath one magnitude and figure, an Oak another, a Fir Tree another; a Partrich hath one, an Hen another, a Peacock another. Thirdly, the Soul is of it ſelf and primarily in the parts as they are ſimilar,
<note place="margin">The Soul is in the parts as they are ſimilar.</note> and not as they are organical. But the ſimilar parts as ſuch have no certain figure: and therefore the ſoul is not in them as they have a certain figure, or quantity, but only as they are ſuch ſimilar parts. And it is in the organical parts, only as they conſiſt of ſimilar parts. So that the Soul is not in the Bone, as it is a Tooth, a Shank, an Arm-bone, or an Ankle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone, but only as it is a Bone, and it is equally in all Bones. And therefore in fractures in which the Bones have many times another figure than naturally they ſhould have the Soul remains nevertheleſs, and is as much in a great <hi>Callus</hi> as it was before in the ſound Bone. And therefore in Nutrition it is brought into the aliment which hath no figure; and it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices that it hath this or that temperament and ſimilary Conſtitution. And ſo the organical diſpoſition is not neceſſary for the firſt act, but only for the ſecond act, or to perform the operations. Nor is the body as it is organical ſimply the adequate ſubject of the Soul; but then only an organical body when the body is now perfect, and ought to operate, and by its operations to preſerve it ſelf alive. And the Organs are required for operation and not to ſimple being; and then only are neceſſary to being when the being cannot be preſerved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out operations; which happens when the Body is already brought to a perfect ſtate. But the figure and organization (as ſome ſpeak) is after the Soul and not before it; and therefore it is not a diſpoſition neceſſary to the reception of the Soul. Moreover the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions to the form are immutable: but the figure and organization in living things are not immutable. Both is apparent in Animals and Plants. The fortieth day is the longeſt term ſet by thoſe that hold the Soul is infuſed. But then the parts are only rudely delineated. And what ſhal be ſaid of bruits whoſe Souls none hold to be infuſed? Is not the Soul there preſently on the firſt daies of the Conception? And this happens much more in Plants. For in the firſt daies when Plants begin to ſhoot and ſprout out of their ſeeds the ſhape of the Plant is yet ſo rude that it cannot be known (ſave by moſt skilful Herbariſts) to be this or that Plant, which afterwards in proceſs of time is many waies changed.</p>
                  <p>Nor is that of any moment which <hi>Sanctacruzius</hi> objects here; ſince Souls are more noble than the forms of Elements and Bodies ſimply mixed, they require alſo a noble configuration and formation, and by how much living things are more noble, by ſo much the more noble body they require, and hence the ſo many ſundry figures of Plants and Animals have their original. True it is indeed, that all living things by reaſon of the divers operations they are to perform do require divers organs; and therefore Plants have one manner of ſhape, Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals another, and every ſort is differently figured according to the nobility of the forms. But it does not from thence follow, that thoſe figures are required for the fabrick of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, before the introduction of the Soul, and that they are a diſpoſition neceſſarily forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Introduction of the Soul; becauſe (as hath been ſaid) that ſame formation of all the Organs is not neceſſary to ſimple being, but only for the better being and performance of operations. And if thoſe that contend ſo eagerly that the body muſt be organized before the ſoul can come into it did but obſerve ſuch things as dayly happen in Nature they would think far otherwiſe. <hi>Fortunius Licetus</hi> the moſt renowned profeſſor at <hi>Padua</hi> hath taught ſufficiently, <hi>de ſpont. Vivent. Ortu,</hi> that the ſoul may remain ſate and ſure in a matter far more vile and ignoble than any ſeed can be thought to be, although it be deſtitute of ſuch things as are requifite to its ſecond Act; which at laſt having attained a fitting matter does rouze it ſelf up and becomes a Plant or Animal. Of which I ſhal ſpeak bereafter in <hi>my Diſcourſe of the ſpontaneous original of living things.</hi>

Becauſe it is not true that ſuch a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue reſides in the ſpirit of the ſeed. Which is proved firſt, becauſe the ſpirit which is in the ſeed is either an eſſential part thereof, or it is not. If it be, it wil follow that one eſſential part of a being is deſtructive to the other eſſential part of the ſaid being. This cannot be, firſt becauſe infinite things are found in the World conſiſting of divers and hererogeneal parts, in which nevertheleſs we never find that the one deſtroyes the other. For if one were ordained to deſtroy the other, it would follow that it were ordained for the deſtruction of the whol, and conſequently of it ſelf. For one eſſential part of a thing being deſtroyed the whol thing is deſtroyed. But the contrary is true; becauſe the eſſential parts of one Being are not made to fight one againſt another, or to deſtroy one another, but that they may be friendly united, and by their friendly union be able to ſuſtain the form; and the form again is ordained to hold thoſe parts united, and to govern them, that they may not part aſunder, nor mutually deſtroy each other. For if it were not ſo, the form could never perſiſt and abide in things heterogeneal, no not the ſmalleſt time imaginable. Add hereunto, that all action proceeds from a total being, and a perfect being; but the eſſential parts of one being are not the whol being, nor a perfect being; and conſequently they act not by themſelves. So far <hi>Fienus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this Argument is not ſo ſtrong as <hi>Caranza</hi> doth imagine.
<note place="margin">
                        <p>The ſoul is the firſt Agent in the ſeed.</p>
                        <p>Two parts in the ſeed.</p>
                     </note> For in the firſt place we muſt know, that to ſpeak properly the ſeed is not the cauſe of Conformation, but the ſoul in the ſeed. And ſo when a living body is formed out of ſeed, the ſame thing does not act up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it ſelf. For there are in the ſeed two parts; the ſoul and the body of the ſeed. Now the firſt Agent is the ſoul, which does not act upon it ſelf, but upon the ſubject matter, viz. the body of the ſeed, and alſo upon the Mothers blood, which in Animals it draws to form the yong one, and in Plants upon that Aliment which it draws out of the Earth. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:35070:163"/>when a Plant or Animal is generated the ſeed ceaſes to be: yet that Generation is no corruption but perfection, and that body which is called Seed whiles it turns to a Plant or Animal it is brought into a more noble ſtate and perfected; nor (as <hi>Jul. Caeſ. Scaliger</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Exercitat.</hi> 268.) is the Seed otherwiſe ſaid to be corrupted than that it ceaſes to be as it was before, viz. in aptitude, and becomes as it was not, viz. in act. Now it is the ſame matter with the ſame formal Principle, to which nothing elſe is added than the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Organs which were before confuſed. And thus while of the Seed is made a Plant or Animal, the Body of the Seed does not transſer it ſelf into another condition, but by the Soul lying hid therein it is thereto advanced. Nor (as <hi>Fienus</hi> thinks) wil he that ſhal diligently weigh al theſe things uſe that anſwer which <hi>Fienus</hi> brings and endeavors to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſute, that there are two divers ſubſtances in the Seed, the one thin and ſpirituous, the other groſs and earthy; and in the former reſides the active vertue, the latter being the matter and paſſive principle. Such a ſpirit there is indeed in Seed, but it is not the primary cauſe of conformation, but the Inſtrumental; but the Soul which uſes that ſpirit is the primary cauſe. And whereas he dares deny that there is a ſpirit in the ſeed, I can ſcarce ſufficiently admire it, and the reaſons whereby he would prove it are very ſleight. For in the firſt place that ſpirit which is in the ſeed as an Eſſential part tends not to the deſtruction but to the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction thereof. Alſo it is falſe that every action proceeds from a total being. For is there no action of the ſoul upon the body which it informs? And whereas he denies there is a ſpirit in the ſeeds of other living things, we ſhal refute that hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly,
<note place="margin">Whether the Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Cauſe be alwaies external?</note> This alſo offends ſome that they ſuppoſe that thus the diſtinction is taken away betwixt the internal and external Cauſes: of which the former are the matter and form, the latter the Efficient and End: and they aver that no Efficient Cauſe does ever go into the Eſſence of the Effect, and that Animals in Generation do not produce ſeed either out of their own matter, or out of their own form; but that the ſeed is generated of the mixture of blood and ſpirit in the ſtones, and that a man does not generate by communication of his Eſſence, but by his form as an Efficient Cauſe. But in very deed, this Doctrine of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of Souls does no waies take away the diſtinction of Cauſes. For it is known even to Novices in Philoſophy, that the ſame Eſſence may be both the Form and the Efficient Cauſe, the Form as it informs the Matter, the Efficient as it is the cauſe of al Operations per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the compound. The reſt are but Beggings of the Queſtion, and are ſaid, not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. I like <hi>Zabarella</hi>'s Opinion better, who writes, <hi>de facultat. animae, cap.</hi> 11. <hi>That li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving things when they generate their like do confer and beſtow ſome of their matter, and ſome of their form, inaſmuch as they confer an animated ſeed, and endued with the ſame vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal faculty which was in the Generator.</hi> For although they communicate no part of their own body, yet they communicate that ſelf ſame matter of which they are nouriſhed, but changed into a more noble ſubſtance. But that which hath brought very many into this Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror is this,
<note place="margin">
                        <p>The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twert Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and an Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer.</p>
                        <p>Whether the ſoul goes out of one ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
                     </note> Becauſe they conceit living things are generated after the ſame manner as artificial things are produced by an external Agent. But there is a great difference betwixt Artificial and Natural things. For every Artificer communicates nothing of his own: but living things which beget their like cannot do the ſame unleſs they communicate their own Eſſence.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, Neither is that of any moment that they ſuppoſe if Generation ſhould be made by tranimiſſion of the ſoul, that then the ſoul ſhould paſs into another matter as a new ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, or ſhould be of it ſelf diviſible. For as in Augmentation, and when of an Acorn a tal Oak grows up, the Soul when it communicates it ſelf to new matter does not paſs from one ſubject to another, but remaining ſtil the ſame communicates it ſelf to new matter: ſo when the ſoul communicates it ſelf to the ſeed it does not paſs from one ſubject to another, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining the ſame in the Generator it diffuſes it ſelf into the ſeed. Nor is it therefore of it ſelf diviſible. For as when a root or branch is pluckt from a Plant,
<note place="margin">The ſoul is not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible.</note> of which (being ſet in the ground) a new Plant ariſes, the ſoul of the former Plant is not diminiſhed, but remains en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely the ſame: ſo alſo when a ſoul is communicated by the Generator to the ſeed, the ſoul of the Generator is not made leſſer, but remains the ſame it was. Nor is there here any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt the Root and the brauch pluckt from the Plant and the Seed. For there are ſeveral waies of propagating Plants. And that the root and branch is animated, but not the ſeed, is only ſaid, but not proved. For though the Seed be not a part as the root and branch is; yet it is the fruit of the Plant which is animated as much as the parts are, yes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the ſoul after a more excellent manner.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Many do alſo object this, That if the ſeed of the Plant were animated it ſhould be already eſſentially a Plant. But if it were eſſentially a Plant when it grows out
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:35070:164"/>of the ground,
<note place="margin">whether the ſeed be a Plant?</note> there would be no Generation of a Plant, and ſo in the Tree and that Herb in which the Seed was produced there ſhould be a generation, and a Tree or Herb ſhould be generated in a Tree or Herb, and not in the Earth; which is abſurd. But the whol argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is granted in its ſenſe, and that which is counted abſurd is no waies abſurd indeed, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it be rightly explained.
<note place="margin">what things are required to genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> For truly the generation of the ſeed in a living thing does not finiſh the Generation; how beit the principal and chief work which is neceſſary to Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the Elaboration of the ſeminal matter that it may be a fit ſubject wherewith the ſoul may be propagated, and the communication of the Soul to the matter ſo elaborated. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit this alſo afterard belongs to Generation, that the ſeed which hath received the Soul from the Generator may no longer adhere to the Generator, but may be ſeparated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, and that that which before was but one individual of the ſame kind may now become more than one.
<note place="margin">when Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration is made.</note> Which when it is performed a Tree or Herb is truly ſaid to generate, but not when the Plant grows up out of the Earth. And when a Plant ſhoots up out of the Earth that is not its generation, but it is the bringing of a Plant which is in its imperfect act to its perfect act. Nor is it conſiderable, as <hi>Fienus</hi> himſelf writes, <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 5. <hi>concluſ.</hi> 6. (though he be otherwiſe of a contrary Opinion in this Queſtion) what the common People cal Generation, or what not; nor what agrees with their underſtanding, but what is ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to right reaſon and to truth. For the common people are ignorant of Philoſophy, and know not when or where the true production of a Plant is made, and its Eſſential Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and know not how to diſtinguiſh betwixt the firſt and the ſecond act; betwixt that which is imperfect and that which is perfect, and therefore takes one for another, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits that a Plant is then generated when it is perfected and operates, and when it brings forth roots and Leaves, whoſe production is not the very Generation of the Plant, but the operation and perfection thereof being already generated. And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf calls the ſeed and that out of which it is bred,
<note place="margin">How many waies the form is in a thing.</note> 
                     <hi>Synonyma's;</hi> We muſt therefore diſtinguiſh betwixt the Entitive and Formal Act, and that which is ſimply Formal, and reſpectively. For then is the Form ſaid to be preſent in a perfect act when it hath al its Organs neceſſary to perform its actions, but not when it is in a part, or in the matter of the ſeed, and that not yet fitted with al its Organs. For otherwiſe the branch of a Fir-tree (in which it cannot be denied that the ſoul is) ſhould be called a Fir-tree; and the Foot of a Man ſhould be called a Man. And therefore we cannot argue from the preſence of the Form to the denomination of the thing formed, but then a thing is rightly ſaid to be an Animal or other living body when the ſoul is in its ſubject rightly diſpoſed, or can perform the Operations belonging to its kind.</p>
                  <p>Eightly,
<note place="margin">whether the ſeed be an Animal</note> Out of which their Objection may eaſily be anſwered, who ſay, If the ſeed were actually animated, the ſeed of a Poppy were a Poppy, and the ſeed of a Dog would be a Dog. For the ſorts of Natural things are not denominated from the Eſſence which the Form gives, but from that Conſtitution whereby they are ſenſible ſpecies of the World. And therefore though in reſpect of the Form the Eſſence of a Dog and of the ſeed of a Dog is one and the ſame; yet ſince the Conſtitution of the ſeed and the Dog differ in reſpect of the Corporeal and ſenſible parts, the ſeed is not called a Dog, but the ſeed of a Dog. After the ſame manner though there be one and the ſame Soul in the Butter-fly and the Silk-worm, yet the Silkworm is not called a Butter-fly till it hath wings and can flie.</p>

But life is taken two manner of waies,
<note place="margin">How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waies life is taken?</note> either for the firſt act, or the eſſence it ſelf of living things, or for the ſecond act or operation. Seeds live by the firſt act, but not neceſſarily by the ſecond act, nor do they neceſſarily perform the actions of living things. And that place of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is only to be underſtood of living things perfectly formed. But in the mean while the ſoul in the ſeed is not quite idle, but it keeps the ſeed alive, and therefore ſeeds are ſo long fruitful as they retain the ſoul in them: but after they have loſt the ſoul they become dead and unfruitful. Nor are the Operations of the Soul confined to nutrition only, but there are alſo other Operations thereof, as Conformation. Yet as ſoon as any Conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made, and as ſoon as the ſeed hath attained a fit place and matter, the ſoul preſently draws nouriſhment for the formation and nutrition of its body.</p>
                  <p>And thus I conceive it is proved in general, That the ſoul is in the ſeed, and that it is the Cauſe of the Conformation of the Body animate, and I conceive al Objections are fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:35070:164"/>Howbeit ſome when they can hardly object any ſolid reaſon againſt our Opinion do fly to the Authority of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> but miſs-underſtood, and they ſay that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> writes that the ſeed is potentially animated, and that therefore there is not actually any ſoul in the ſeed. But here the moſt renowned <hi>Caſparus Hofmannus</hi> rightly anſwers, <hi>tract.
<note place="margin">Whether the ſeed be potentially animated?</note> de origine formarum,</hi> that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> does ſo often attribute an act to the ſeed, that it is the part of a man very unskilful to urge only thoſe places wherein he ſaies it is an aptitude. Howbeit, more Reaſons ſhal be produced in the following Chapters, wherein we ſhal treat particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the generation of living things, viz. Plants and Animals: and what hath hitherto been alleadged ſhal be explained and confirmed, and ſuch objections as may yet be made ſhal be anſwered.</p>
                  <p>See alſo of this Subject the lately commended Doctor, <hi>Caſper Hofmannus,</hi> who in <hi>tract. de form. origin.</hi> joyned to his Books of the Generation of Man, proves the ſame Opinion by moſt firm reaſons, and ſolidly refutes the contrary Opinion of <hi>Bonamicus,</hi> the Conimbri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſian Collegiates, <hi>Peter Fonſeca, Franc. Suarez, Ant. Ruvio, Benedictus Pererius, Franciſcus Vicomercatus, Fridericus Pendaſius.</hi> And in good deed the judgment which he makes of the Conimbricenſian Collegiates is moſt true of al thoſe who defend the Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Soul out of the aptitude of the matter, and deny that ſeeds are actually ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated. Not to ſay (quoth he) that they mix many things not belonging to Natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, they invent diſtinctions little leſs than fooliſh, they put conditions where they ought not to be, the greateſt difficulties they touch not ſo much as with their little finger: in a word, they intangle and obſcure, but do not explain the Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>But the Soul frequently uſes the Spirit (in its ſhaping the Body) which is in the ſeed,
<note place="margin">
                        <p>The ſoul uſes the ſpirit when it ſhapes the body.</p>
                        <p>Whether there be a ſpirit in the ſeeds of Plants.</p>
                     </note> and makes it to be fruitful, and reſembles the Element of the Stars, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> tels us 2. <hi>de ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerat. cap.</hi> 3. And as long as that ſpirit is in the Seeds, ſo long the ſoul is as it were in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſubject: but as ſoon as that ſpirit vaniſhes, the Soul can bide no longer in the ſeed, and the ſeed becomes unfruitful. Which ſpirit I admire that <hi>Fienus</hi> could not diſcern. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if he had ſeen a ſpirit drawn by Chymical diſtillation out of dry ſeeds which wil take flame, he would not have written, <hi>de format. mat. quaeſt.</hi> 6: what ſpirituous ſubſtance can there be in the ſeeds of Plants, kept a long time in a Box, and dry, but yes fruitful?</p>
                  <p>He indeed objects in <hi>Apolog. Adverſus Sanctacruzium, pag.</hi> 99. If there are (quoth he) Spirits in Plants, in what place are they generated? For there ought, as in Animals, ſo in Plants ſome place be aſſigned, in which they ſpring, and from which they flow into the Plant. Again, he ſaies; there is no actual Heat. But in Plants there ſeems to be no actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Heat. For if there were it would be perceived ſome way or other. For a tangible qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is the proper object of the ſenſe of feeling. Therefore where it is it muſt needs be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. How comes it therefore that in a great heap of Herbs, and a great heap of Seeds, Corn, Pulſe, there is not at leaſt ſome ſmal heat perceived. Thirdly, heat and cold are contrary qualities, and mutually deſtroy one another, and the greater and more intenſe does overcome and corrupt the leſſer; how can it therefore be that this heat in ſo many Plants which laſt all the Winter, ſhould not be extinguiſhed. For the Heat of infinite living Creatures being much greater, is extinguiſhed by the Winter cold, and why ſhould not that of Plants be extinguiſhed if they have any?</p>
                  <p>But theſe are toies unworthy ſo famous a man. For, firſt there needs no place nor cavity in Plants for this ſpirit to breed in as there is in Animals: for as they have not any thing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering to the ſtomach or Liver of Animals, wherein their nutriment is bred, but that nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritive power is ſpred through their whol body: even ſo that ſpirit is bred in the whol body of the Plant. And if any man ſhal hold, that in the root or trunk rather, as the nutriment ſo the ſpirit alſo is chiefly elaborated, he wil hold nothing that is abſurd. And that there is ſuch a part in Plants that are tender is manifeſt, as in the Colewort and many more. For although the cold and froſt do ſo hurt the Leaves that they die: yet if that part which is in the middle, which the Germans cal the Heart, remain ſafe and ſound, the Plant recollects it ſelf and grows again. But if that part be alſo hurt the whol Plant dies. For although (as <hi>Fienus</hi> objects) branches cut from the Tree do grow; yet that makes not againſt our Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For as thoſe ſouls according to the diviſion of their ſubject, are in ſome ſort diviſible: ſo alſo the ſpirits are which make the proper ſubject of the Soul.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That alſo is of no moment which he ſaies: where there is no Heat, there is no Spirit; and where Heat is it muſt needs be felt. Is there not I pray you Heat in the Spirit of Wine? and is it actually felt? Is there not fire in all mixt bodies? and yet are they al actually hot? by no means. For as <hi>Zabarella</hi> rightly teaches, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de miſt. gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat.
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:35070:165"/>&amp; Interit.</hi> the Qualities in mixt bodies are after a ſort hidden by the tempering of contraries, ſo that neither of them can be diſtinctly diſcerned. Nor is that objection of any force if it be not felt in one Plant, it ought to be felt in a great Heap of Plants. For the Nature and proportion of mixture is one and the ſame in a great Heap of Plants as it is in one Plant. But hath <hi>Fienus</hi> never ſeen what an Heat is raiſed when ſuch an heap of Plants comes to putrifie, or when an heap of Corn begins to ſprout? Certainly in Granaries even in the coldeſt time of Winter, heaps of Corn which have lain long unſtirred do conceive no ſmal Heat, which a man may feel with his Hand. Yea and the Corn it ſelf if it lie long unſtirred does ſprout.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That this ſame Spirit and Heat in ſome Plants (for all do not outlaſt the Winters cold) is extinguiſhed, comes from the nature of mixture. For there is a ſeveral mixture in ſeveral Animals and in ſeveral Plants. Geeſe go bare-foot in the cold Ice which men cannot do. Roſemary is hurt with a ſmal cold, but ſo is not the Fir-tree. But I eaſily agree with <hi>Fienus</hi> that ſome hidden Quality of kin to the Element of the Stars does concur.</p>

<note place="margin">How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kinds of live things</note> Now there are two kinds of live things, Plants and Animals, or living creatures: which have alſo a different way of propagation. For there is in ſome living Creatures ſexes, in others not. In ſuch as have no ſexes one ſeed is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, which is a body ſo elaborate and diſpoſed by the Generator, that when it is perfect it may be ſeperated from the Generator, ſubſiſt intire by it ſelf, and with it the ſoul of the Generator may be transferred into the thing generated. And then a Tree ingenders as (<hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger</hi> ſaies,

                     <hi>Exercit.</hi> 6. <hi>ſect.</hi> 10.) when it produces ſeed. And that this ſeed is animated, appears from the reaſons propounded in the foregoing Chapter; and it is ſo manifeſt, that <hi>Joh. Gallego de la ſerna</hi> a Spaniard, was forced to grant that the ſeeds of Plants were anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>de Princip Generat. Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. (although he denies that the ſeeds of Animals are ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated) and writes that this opinion is ſo founded upon the moſt firm reaſons of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, that they being underſtood no true Philofopher can deny the ſame. And the reaſons are indeed moſt ſtrong whereby it is proved that the ſeed of Plants is animated. For in the firſt place ſince when the ſeed was in the Plants it was animated as being a part of the Plant, ſurely when it is ſeparated it muſt be animated; ſince no cauſe can be aſſigned which drove out the ſoul, nor can ſeparation alone do that, for even in the ſeparated ſeed alſo the actions of a ſoul appear, and therefore as Branches, Roots, Buds, Bulbs, by avulſion do not loſe their ſoul, but grow and flouriſh: it is alſo ſo ordered that the ſeed being ſeparated from the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerator can ſubſiſt intire and freſh, although ſome ſeed a longer, other ſome a ſhorter while, which other parts pluckt from Plants do not commonly do, but preſently die. Moreover as ſoon as by the Heat of the Sun, yea and of the Fire in the Winter time, it is but warmed in a ſtove, and finds fit matter, or but a little Water if it be moiſtened therewith as is ſeen in the making of Mair, it begins to diſplay it ſelf, and firſt thruſts out a Root, by which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it draws nouriſhment, and forms the body of a Plant like that it came from: which formation of the bodies of Plants is no leſs wonderful than the Generation of Animals. For ſo it attracts matter fit for every part,

Moreover, ſince we ſee that Plants not only by their Roots, but alſo by a ſmal Branch of a Willow, a bit of an Hop or Acorns Root cut off do grow up into a like Plant, the Soul being pluckt away with the part; and it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that of a branch of a Willow or a Vine, or of another Tree, although in it there is no Root, nor all the parts of a Plant, yea of a Leaſe only of an Indian Fig-tree an whol entire Plant is formed; and no other cauſe can be aſſigned of the formation of this new Plant than the ſoul pluckt away from the former Plant with a part thereof: why ſhould we not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that a Plant is formed of the ſeed after the ſame manner? Nor is it credible that al the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther productions of Plants are made by the communication of the ſoul from the former Plant
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:35070:165"/>and only that made by the ſeed ſhould be performed without the preſence of the ſoul in the ſeed. But more likely it is that as when Roots, Bulbs, Branches, Boughs are put in the Earth they do not from thence receive their ſoul, but that with the ſoul which they actually had they perfect themſelves by producing neceſſary parts and organs: that in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net alſo it is in ſeed. Nay we have more reaſon to think that this ſhould happen in ſeed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is generated by the Plant to this very Intent, and hath a much more perfect diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion neceſſary for the conſervation of the ſoul and its propagation than the Roots or Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; ſince the wonderful artifice of Nature is apparent in many ſeeds. There is indeed one man who conceives that this does not declare the manner of the ſouls propagation, for this reaſon, becauſe in Growing whatever grows on the Plant is a part of its body, and the part ought to have the ſame ſoul that the whol hath: but the ſeed is no part of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy nor grows faſt to the ſame. But although it cannot be denied that the ſeed of a Plant ſince it is not generated to that end to abide upon the Plant, nor does alwaies ſtick to the ſame, but may be ſeparated therefrom, is not after the ſame manner a part of the Plant: yet becauſe while it is in the Plant it lives by the common ſoul of the Plant, in that ſence alſo it may be called a part of the Plant. But ſince it is made to be ſeparated therefrom, it may moſt conveniently (as was ſaid in <hi>Cap.</hi> 6.) be termed the fruit. Which is equally anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with, yea and after a more noble manner than the parts, viz. inaſmuch as thereby the ſoul may be propagated, which in Animals by the parts it cannot be. Sure it is in the mean while, that as when the Soul is diffuſed into new matter it becomes neither greater nor leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer: ſo alſo when the ſoul is propagated with the Seed; the ſoul of the Parent is not dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed thereby.</p>
                  <p>For here it is to be noted,
<note place="margin">Sundry manners of the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Plants.</note> That there is not one and the ſame manner of propagation in Plants; which being obſerved that may eaſily be cleared which hath ſcrupled ſome, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt alſo <hi>Franciſcus Valleſius, de ſacra Philoſoph, cap.</hi> 1. how that ſhould be true which we find written in <hi>Geneſis</hi> 1. verſe 11. that God commanded that the Earth ſhould bring forth Herbs or Plants, having Seed in themſelves according to their kind; when as the Willow, Fern, and very many Plants beſides, do beat no ſeed. For the ſeminal na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in Plants is not one and the ſame, nor does it confine the ſeed to Fruits and Cods only; but this happens to ſome alone; but in others the ſeminal Vertue is adherent in other parts, ſomtimes in one, ſomtimes in more, and ſomtimes in different parts. For examples ſake, Poppy is propagated only by its ſeed, not by its toor, ſtalk, or leaf. And ſo it is with Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuce and very many more. Roſemary is propagated both by ſeed and branch, and ſo are Pear-trees and Apple-trees; the Hop by its toor; the Indian Fig-tree by its leaf; Onions and moſt bulbed Plants by root and ſeed both; ſuch as bear buds, goſlings, or palms, are propagated by their branches, as the Vine, Willow, and others. Alſo ſome have their ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal vertue in the tears or liquor which drops from them. For as the ſouls are more or leſs noble; ſo for the multiplication of themſelves they require a more or leſs noble matter wherein to propagate their ſeminal vertue. And hence it comes to paſs that Muſhroms or Toadſtools being the moſt ignoble of al Plants are propagated only by pouring then deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction about the Roots of Trees. Yea,
<note place="margin">Plants propagated by Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of water, and by rains.</note> the ſeminal matter of Plants may be transferred in inundations of Water, and in Rains, as <hi>Theophraſtus, Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Cauſis plant. cap.</hi> 5. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, how by reaſon of a certain thick ſhower of Rain, <hi>Laſerpitium</hi> ſprung up in <hi>Apturea,</hi> whereas it had never grown in that part of the World before; and that there a great Wood hath grown up where there never was any before. So that it may rightly be ſaid of ſuch things which are beleeved to ſpring out of the Earth of their own accord, that the nature ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal rather hes hid than is not, as ſhal be ſaid hereafter when we handle the Original of things which ſpring of themſelves. Nor am I inclined to ſay with <hi>Valleſius,</hi> that there are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Animals or Plants, which though as the firſt they were not created, yet they might after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards grow naturally from the Elements of the World. For the Elements of the World have no vertue to produce ſuch a ſeed. Nor let any man attribute this Formation of Plants to the Suns Hear. For this Formation is not only made when a Plant is cheriſhed by the Heat of the Sun, but by the Heat of the Fire alſo.
<note place="margin">The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Plants not cauſed by the Sun.</note> And it belongs to the Form and not to the Sun to determine Quantities. For Nature uſes Hear as a Miniſter or Inſtrument, not as a Law-giver or Work-maſter. Otherwiſe in al Plants that ſame Quantity would be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and the ſame figure. For the Sun is the ſame to al; and the ſtore-houſe of Mother Earth is the ſame; and the contrary is ſeen to happen, as <hi>Julius Caeſar Scaliger</hi> writes in 1. <hi>de Plantis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="498" facs="tcp:35070:166"/>
                  <p> Not let that trouble any man in this place which <hi>Thomas Fienus</hi> aledges <hi>de format. foet. queſt.</hi> 5. as alſo was ſaid before that a Plant is produced after one manner from a Root, a Branch, or Leaf, and after another manner from the ſeed. That out of the former a new Plant is not produced, but they themſelves when cut off from the Plant are new Plants, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by the cutting from the whol, they have already the vegetative ſoul multiplied by diviſion, but that the contrary happens in ſeed. For that the ſeed is not a new plant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath no ſoul, but it becomes a new Plant by the ſouls coming into it after it is planted in the Earth. But here is no diverſity of propagation; for the Root, the Branch, the Leaf, is not an entire Plant, and after the ſame manner as by the cuttting off of theſe from the Plant, the ſoul is multiplied by diviſion; ſo alſo by the Generation and emiſſion of ſeed the ſoul is multiplied. And whereas he grants the Soul is in the Root, the Branch, the Leaf, and denies it to be in the Seed, he does it without Reaſon. For ſince in it the ſame Operations appear as in thoſe; why ſhould we not grant the ſoul to be as wel in it? And if in the Seed caſt into the Earth there is no Soul, whence I pray you is it afterward produced therein, and whence communicated? Alſo that is falſe which he writes, That the Soul which is in the Branch or the Root planted, is the ſame numerically with that which is in the Tree or whol Plant. Indeed it was the ſame in number while the root or branch was on the Tree; but after it was cut from the Tree it began to exiſt by it ſelf; and was made different in number from that in the Tree. I wonder alſo that <hi>Fienus</hi> ſhould deny the Seed of Plants to be animated, ſince nevertheleſs in the Chapter foregoing, <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 5. <hi>Concluſ.</hi> 6. he expreſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y holds that the Conformation of the Seed in the Earth is not an eſſential Generation, but only the perfection of a new Plant already conſtituted and generated in the Tree. For there is no other Generation of a Plant in the Tree, ſave when ſeed is genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>But concerning the Seed of Plants,
<note place="margin">The won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfulmnl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication of Plants.</note> two things are here to be obſerved: the firſt is, That that ſame multiplication whereby the Soul diffuſes it ſelf into the new Plant, is moſt of all manifeſt in Plants, and almoſt infinite. Not to ſpewak of Poppy, Turky Wheat, and very many others; Tobacco does ſo mukiply it ſelf, that he who firſt by numbring, and then by weighing (for it were an endleſs labor to number al the ſeeds) wil take a ſcantling and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the number of the ſeeds, he ſhal find that of one Seed more than three hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſeeds do ſpring, and if the product of theſe be ſown the third year, he ſhal find an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of an hundred thouſand Mytiads (a myriad containing ten thouſand.) So powerful was that Divine Benediction; <hi>Encreaſe and multiply.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover,
<note place="margin">Two parts of the ſeed in Plants.</note> This alſo is to be noted touching the ſeed of Plants, That in them as in al ſeeds there are two parts; the one primary and which is only worthy of the name of ſeed; and another which ſerves only as a covering. The former conſiſte of the Soul, which is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the lif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and formation of a Plant, and the matter, of which the firſt rudiments of the Plant, viz. the Root and the firſt Sprouts are conſtituted. For the Seeds of Plants in what ever place moiſtened and cheriſhed with heat, even without the Earth, do firſt gape and thruſt out their roots, and afterwards their firſt ſproutings: but the body of the perfect Plant can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be entirely formed, unleſs aliment be drawn from the Earth by the firſt ſmal roots. And ſo in theſe there is not the ſame Agent and Patient, but the Soul is the Cauſe of Formation, I ſay the Efficient and Agent Cauſe, and the Matter is the Patient on which it works. But that which is in Plants is properly the Seed, and hath the ſoul and matter out of which the firſt Rudiments of the Plants are framed is only that pulp which contains in it the Idea and delineation of the whol Plant.
<note place="margin">The pulp of the ſeed.</note> And indeed the whol pulp of the Seed is not animated, but only that part thereof which is commonly called <hi>Corculum.</hi> Which part if it be corrupted, the ſeed wil not grow. And therefore the Piſmires are reported to gnaw that part of the ſeed that when it is by them hoorded up it may not ſprout. Contrariwiſe, although the reſt of the Body be gnawn by worms, yet it grows, provided the Heart be ſafe, as we ſee in Beans and Peaſe, and French-bean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. But the reſt and greateſt part of the Pulp is not made in vain, but is in place of Nutriment as it were for the tender Plant which is immediately produced of the ſeed moſt properly ſo called, as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> eaſie to ſee in French Beans, which being ſet in the ground, when they begin to ſhoot one part goes downwards and makes a root, the other goes upward and makes the reſt of the Body of the Plant. On one ſide of this tender Plant lies the reſt of the body of the ſeed, out of which a channel or pipe of Conveyance goes into the tender Plant, by which alimentary juyce is carried thereinto, until it grows up and gets ſtrength of it ſelf to draw alimentary juyce out of the Earth to it ſelf,
<note place="margin">The Bark of ſeed why made</note> and to elaborate the ſame. In reſpect therefore of the pulp of ſeeds it happens that the remaining part of the ſeed ſo called, viz. the external Bark, is only the Caſe (as it were) of the true ſeed which defends the pulp or
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:35070:166"/>true ſeed againſt external injuries, and that external Bark to the Barks, and Shels, and Membranes of Eggs. For ſince the ſeeds of Plants are not preſently caſt into the Mothers Womb as the ſeed of Creatures that bring forth live young ones is, but are many times kept long out of the Earth which is their Matrix, this Bark defends that ſame internal ſeed againſt the external injuries, leſt before it begins to ſprout, or in the very ſprouting, it ſhould be hurt by external occurrent cauſes.</p>
                  <p>From which it appears, although (as was ſaid before <hi>cap.</hi> 6.) the ſeed may alſo be called Fruit: yet that there is ſome difference betwixt Fruit and Seed. For that is properly ſeed which is ſimply neceſſary to generation ſuch as is the marrow of the ſeed, which alſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs becauſe it is produced by the Generator it may alſo be termed the Fruit. But becauſe the Creator hath compaſſed ſome ſeeds with Pulps which are not neceſſary for the generation of that ſpecies, but ſerve for meat for man or for other uſes, as in Cherries, Apples, Pears, Peaches, Grapes, all that wherein the Seed is it commonly called the Fruit. And ſo according to nature the Fruit is either Seed, or that which contains ſeed in it, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> writes, 1. <hi>de generat. Animalium, cap.</hi> 18. Yet by Art it may come to paſs that the fruit ſo called may be without ſeed: as Cherries without Cherry ſtones, and the Berries of Grapes without ſtones: which is performed by taking the marrow out of the Branch. From which it appears that the Marrow in Trees does thiefly make towards Generation.</p>

                     </gap>ation may eaſily free themſelves from many Objections urged againſt their Opinion. But moſt Phyſitians think the contrary, who hold that the formative vertue is as wel in the Seed of the Female as of the Male; and they conceive they have reaſon ſo to think, as for other cauſes, ſo becauſe of the likeneſs of the yong ones, ſometime to the Father, ſomtime to the Mother, and ſomtime to both: not only when Animals are generated by Animals of the ſame ſort; but then alſo when Generation is made by Animals of different ſorts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the work of the Fathers and Mothers ſoul does manifeſtly appear. So a Mule is made of a Mare and a hee Aſs, a Mulet of a ſtone Horſe and a ſhee Aſs; of an Ox and an Aſs the ſtrongeſt ſort of Mules; the Indian Dog of a Tiger and a Bitch; the Dog-lyon of a Lyon and a Bitch; a ſtrong Dog of a Wolf and a Bitch; the Laconick Dogs of a Dog and a ſhee Fox; of the Pard and Lyoneſs the Leopard; a Muſmus of a ſhee Goat and a Ram; and many other Animals: of which ſee <hi>Johannes Baptiſta Porta, Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Mag.

For this Law hath been eſtabliſhed by the Creator, that as it were from two partial cauſes one prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and one total cauſe ſhould ariſe, from whence one motion and efficiency ſhould ariſe to the production of the yong Animal,
<note place="margin">The mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Forms is poſſible.</note> but in a certain Order and Method. Nor ſhould the Mixture of Souls or Forms offend any one in this caſe, by reaſon of ſome feigned Metaphyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Axioms, For the Male and Female are of the ſame ſort, and therefore it is as little ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd that the ſoul of the two ſeeds ſhould be conjoyned as for two flames to be united. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> did not count the mixture of ſouls ſo abſurd a thing, as appears by that Speech of his, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Vict. rat. text.</hi> 61. <hi>If any man cannot think that ſouls are mingled, he is void of reaſon.</hi> Here <hi>Fienus</hi> objects in his 6. <hi>Quaeſt. de form. foet.</hi> If the Seeds ſhould be mixed, and the actions of both ſhould concur, their effect would alwaies be mixed, and alwaies half Maſculine and half Feminine, and no yong one would ever perfectly reſemble the Father or the Mother, but alwaies partly one, and partly the other. Alſo he thinks it impoſſible that thoſe two vertues can alwaies ſo evenly conſpire to one effect, but that they ſhould often err, and inſtead of one part make two; or inſtead of two one, one formative vertue making one in this place, and of this part of the ſeed, and the other making another in another place and of another part of the ſeed; ſo that Monſters would be frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred. <hi>Averrboes</hi> and others do eaſily anſwer this Objection who hold there is no active Principle in the Seed of the Female. But they alſo who hold that there is an active Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and a formative Faculty in the Females ſeed, have an anſwer for this Objection. How that God made two Sexes, and in al Animals created both Male and Female is a ſure thing; but why he made Sexes is known to his own Wiſdom. <hi>Plato</hi> relates a Fable in <hi>Sympoſio,</hi> That in the beginning there was no difference of Sexes amongſt Men, and that al were then Hermaphrodites, but becauſe of their Pride and Arrogance God cut Men aſunder, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed the two Sexes diſtinct one from another, ſo that one could do nothing towards its own preſervation without the other. But Sexes are not in Man-kind alone, but in other Animals alſo.</p>
                  <p>But to the Objections of <hi>Fienus</hi> it may be anſwered, That there alwaies appears a ſign of the conjunction of both ſouls, and there is no creature but the yong one does reſemble both the Parents, either in the external form of Body, or the diſpoſitions of the mind, or in both.
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:35070:167"/>Yet it is not neceſſary that they ſhould alwaies equally reſemble both Parents. For if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ſeeds be ſtronger than the other the yong wil moſt reſemble the Parent which that ſeed came from.
<note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of ſouls ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd.</note> Not is it any way neceſſary that an Error ſhould be committed in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation if the ſouls be conjoyned. For they are of the ſame ſpecies &amp; like as when two flames are united they perform one inſeparable effect, ſo two ſouls joyned together do conſpire to make up one effect. And there are alſo examples hereof in Plants; whereof <hi>Scaliger Exercit.</hi> 106. <hi>ſect.</hi> 6. thus writes: <hi>I wil tel you a greater matter which wil more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage you in ſearching out the manner of Generation, than to know all unprofitable rules and Laws of Cylinders. Set three Date Stones, and ſo many Palmes wil thence grow up, and ſo diſtinct, as the Stones themſelves were; and theſe three branches wil grow togeher and become one Palm with one Stock. And of theſe Stones no otherwiſe ſet than aforeſaid ſprings the Palm-tree as</hi> Theophraſtus <hi>informs us: one ſtock in number ariſing from three Trunks, ſeparated in Original, Matter, Quantity and Place.</hi> So far <hi>Scaliger.</hi> For every ſtem and each palm firſt ſpringing out of the Earth hath its own ſoul: yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs theſe three Palms grow into one numerical Palm; which is not only to be ſeen in the palm, but in the Ingraſting of all Plants in which the Stock on which the Branch is ingrafted hath its own ſoul, alſo the Branch hath its ſoul: of the branch and ſtock one Plant and Tree is made and furniſhed with one only ſoul. And not only of the ſame ſort, but dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſouls are alſo joyned, as was ſaid, and may be ſeen in the generation of a Mule, in which the ſouls of an Horſe and a ſhee Aſs are joyned, as is manifeſt by the ſhaping of its parts; alſo in the ingrafting of a Pear upon an Apple, and of other Trees of ſeveral ſorts. For where the power and faculty of the ſoul is, there is the ſoul it ſelf: but in the conformation of a Mule the actions of each ſoul, both of the Horſe and the Aſs, are apparent. And therfore here alſo with <hi>Scaliger</hi> in <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Plantis,</hi> we muſt ſay, <hi>where the thing it ſelf is apparent, if Opinion contradicts the ſame, we muſt ſeek a reaſon, and not be Ignorant of the thing.</hi> And therefore whatever objections are made concerning one ſeed whether of the Male or Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, they are of no moment. For neither is one ſeed alone ſufficient for Generation, but both are neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>Now the Generation of Animals is twofold;
<note place="margin">The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of living Creatures twofold.</note> for ſome bring forth Eggs out of which living things are hatched; others conceive live things within themſelves and afterwards bring them forth. To each of theſe Generations the ſeed of the Male and Female are requiſite, and of them joyned together the Conception is made in which the ſoul is the principal cauſe of the ſhaping of the young Creature. For al the reaſons which prove that the ſeed of Plants is ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, the ſame do alſo firmly prove that the ſeed of Animals is animated; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which prove that generation is made in Plants by the animated ſeed, the ſame reaſons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the ſame thing in Animals. Some indeed do o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>unt it a vain way of reaſoning,
<note place="margin">The Seed of Animals is anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue and demonſtrate the Generation of Animals from the Generation of Plants. But in my judgment they are therein much deceived. For ſince Generation is an action of the vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative faculty, or of the natural faculty as Phyſitians call it, and that faculty is moſt vigorous in Plants, the way of generation in Animals may thereby wel be proved. For ſince all Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration is performed by communication of the Soul and the Body, or as <hi>Zabarella</hi> ſpeaks, every Generator when it Generates does communicate ſome of its matter and ſome of its form, and this communication of matter and ſoul is moſt conſpicuous in Plants, ſo that it can no waies be demed that Plants communicate their ſouls by Seeds, Branches, and roots, and that no Generation is made without the ſoul be communicated by the Generator, Why ſhould I not hold that it betides after the ſame mannerin Animals? And ſince in Plants the preſence of the form in the ſubject is collected by firm demonſtration from their operations; and in the ſeed of Animals the operations of the ſoul, Attraction, Formation, Augmentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are found, we juſtly conclude that the ſoul is preſent therein. And ſince no Agent can immediatly concur to the production of a living Creature, but it muſt have the ſame degree of life formally; and the ſeed of Animals by its own proper virtue, without any new aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Generator, or any motion or direction thereof, yea ſeparated therefrom in place, and many times alſo in time, does produce a living Animal, and is the principal and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>mmediate Agent in the production of the young one; it muſt of neceſſity have formally a like and univocal Soul. And this appears both in ſuch as breed Eggs, and living things.</p>
                  <p>For in the firſt place, as concerning Eggs,
<note place="margin">Eggs have a ſoul in them.</note> that the ſoul of the future Animal is already in them, this ſhews, that as ſoon as Eggs are cheriſhed by a convenient Heat the ſoul in them begins to rouze it ſelf and forms an Animal, like that from whence the Eggs came. Nor can the Generator be the cauſe of this form; ſince it is many times dead when the Eggs are hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched;
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:35070:168"/>nor can any other univocal cauſe be ſo much as imagined. That the Eggs of Silk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms are hatched by a temperate heat, <hi>Hieronymus Vida</hi> does teſtifie in the firſt Book of his Poem of Silk-worms.

<note place="margin">Eggs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the ſeeds of Plants.</note> For the Eggs of Animals being of a middle nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ſeeds of Plants and Animals do agree with both in ſome things, and in other things they differ: they anſwer to the ſeeds of Plants herein, becauſe they contain in them both the ſoul and the matter of the future yong one; moreover the true ſeed is covered with a Bark and Membranes: but herein is the difference, that the ſeeds of Plants when they are committed to the Ground, from it they draw the matter which is neceſſary to form the body, and of the matter of the ſeed the firſt ſmal Roots and ſprouts only are framed, the other parts of matter being drawn out of the Earth: but in Egs ſince the ſoul is ſo barricadoed and ſhut up in Skins and Shels, that it can draw nothingfrom without, and in the mean while the yong one is in a manner perfectly formed in the Egg. Eggs do not only contain ſoul and matter fit to ſhape the firſt rudiments of the yong Creature, but alſo matter neceſſary to ſhape ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a Body and to nouriſh the ſame. And with the ſeeds of Animals they do herein agree, that the ſeed is firſt of all bred in the Stones or the parts analogical to the Stones, and that the ſeed is perfectly caſt by the Male into the Womb of the Female, which is not ſo in Plants whoſe ſeeds are expoſed to many external Injuries, being out of the Earth their Nurſe. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſuch as breed Eggs differ from thoſe which bring forth living Creatures, in that the ſeed of the Egg-bearers is not perfected in the Womb of the Females, as the ſeed of ſuch as beat live young ones is, but is perfect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Now the Generation of living Creatures from Eggs is not after one manner. For ſome are excluded by the Females while they are Egs, and after become Animals being cheriſhed by external Heat. But in Crabs the Eggs ſtick faſt to the Mother, and Crabs are generated in them whiles they are there ſticking.
<note place="margin">Animals which bring forth quick joung ones.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſuch Creatures as engender within themſelves or in their Wombs, do all generate by the meeting together of the ſeed of the Male and the Female; which ſeeds as ſoon as they are conceived in the Womb the ſouls diſplaies it ſelf and begins to frame it ſelf a fitting manſion houſe, which being perfected is called a living Soul Live-wight or Animal. Now the ſeed of both the Parents although it hath the ſoul in it, and therewith lives of it ſelf, yet is it no Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, nor can an Animal be made thereof unleſs both are joyned together. That thing is ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated which hath a ſoul in it, and lives thereby of it ſelf: and that is an Animal or living thing which is furniſhed with a Soul and Body that hath all the Organs requiſite to ſuch a Creature. But the ſeed of the Male or Female alone cannot become an Animal, but the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception which conſiſts of both ſeeds, or of the ſeed and menſtrual Blood, becomes an Animal. And therfore the Male does neither Generate in himſelf, nor doth he engender an Animal eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially perfect,
<note place="margin">The Seed of Animals is anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> nor does he ingender alone.</p>
                  <p>Now that this ſeed of Animals is animated or hath the ſoul in it, the Conformation or ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the yong one ſhews. For either the yong is formed by a cauſe without the ſeed, or within it. Not without it, for none can be imagined; or if any, it muſt be the Womb. But that formation does not ſpring from the Womb is the common opinion of learned men, nor is it deſtitute of reaſons to juſt fie the ſame.</p>

<note place="margin">The yong ones of Animals are not ſhaped by the Womb.</note> 
                     <hi>cap.</hi> 20. endeavors to prove that the Soul of the Mother is the principal cauſe of the Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization and Animation in other Animals, and of the formation and union in Man. And to prove his own Opinion he alleadges certain Authorities of ſome Philoſophers and Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; but contrary to their own evident Underſtanding, which therefore I liſt not to ſet down in this place: And the Reaſons which he uſes are evidently frivolous.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, That there is no Organ in our Body, which by its own ſimilitude and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inclination hath the power of attracting any uſeful ſubſtance for attractions ſake alone, but to enjoy the ſame, and conſequently to change the ſame; but the Womb hath a power and moſt vehement Inclination to draw to it ſelf the matter of the child; <hi>ergo</hi> it draws it not only for attractions ſake, but to enjoy, and conſequently to change the ſame. But I anſwer to the minor, that it is falſe that the Womb in Creatures that have blood does draw to it ſelf blood neceſſary to form the yong one; but the ſoul which is in the Seed draws the ſame, and therefore alſo changes the ſame. For as in Plants the ſeed caſt into the Earth, or a branch of bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> ſet therein, does firſt form and produce roots by which it draws nouriſhment out of the Earth; ſo the ſoul in the yong one in the Womb forms the umbilical Veſſels, by which it draws blood and ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>Moreover he conceives the Generative Faculty hath need of a peculiar Organ, and that the Womb is that Organ, ſince in the whol body there is none like it ſo accommodated for ſuch an action.</p>
                  <p>But both of theſe ſuppoſitions are ſalfe. For in the firſt place the changing faculty is not Organical, not is it performed in a part as it is Organical, but as it is ſimilar, and furniſhed with its innate heat. And although the ſtomach and Liver, and other parts, which do change and generate ſome ſubſtance are Organical: yet they change not nor generate any thing as they are Organical but as they are ſimilary. But they have their Organical conſtitution for their more convement Reception, Retenſion, and Expulſion. So the ſtomach hath the upper Orifice which receives the meat and drink, the Cavity wherein it holds the ſame the lower Orifice, by which the generated <hi>Chylus</hi> is ſent forth. But Concoction is performed in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach inaſmuch as it is a ſimilar part, and furniſhed with its Natural Heat. Again, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſition is falſe, That the Womb does change and inform that blood which comes in for the formation of the Child; ſince that is done by the ſoul in the ſeed. For as when the yong one is formed it hath in it ſelf a nutritive and growing faculty which does not proceed from without: ſo it is alſo in the formation or ſhaping of the ſaid yong one. But the Womb on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affords the place wherein the formation is made, and al the Organical Conſtitution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is contrived to that intent and purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, There are moſt evident Reaſons which prove that the Womb of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther does not perform the ſhaping of the Child, and that it does not give the ſoul to the Child, For in the firſt place, if the Womb did ſhape the Child or yong one whatever, the Male ſhould not communicate the active Principle of Generation, but only the paſſive. Yea, and the Female alone ſhould be the cauſe of Generation, as beſtowing both matter and form, and ſo the female might conceive in het ſelf without a male. Secondly, no reaſon could be given why the yong one ſhould be ſomtimes like the Sire of Father. Thirdly, why ſhould not Females be alwaies generated, and how comes there to be Males? Fourthly, That which performs the work Formation muſt needs immediately touch the Child or yong one: but the Womb does not iminediately touch the yong one, but Membranes come betwixt it and the Womb, and thoſe watry Excrements contained in the Membranes. For whereas <hi>Joh. Gallego</hi> conceives it conveighs its vertue to the yong one through the Membranes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, it is abſurd, nor are the Membranes parts of the yong one, as <hi>Gallego</hi> would have it. Much leſs can that vertue paſs through the Excrements. Nor is that of any moment which he ſaies of the Torpedoes benumming a Mans hand who touches is only with the end of a very long rope, and that the Load-ſtone moves Iron through a thick board. For thoſe actions are performed by ſpiritual Species, as was ſaid before in the Second Diſcourſe, chap. 4. of this Treatiſe, which are as a Ray continually thruſt forth, as <hi>Jul.

                     </gap> of the Womb. Indeed <hi>Johannes Gallego</hi> conceits that it is the part of a blockhead to doubt, Whether the Soul of the Mother can animate the internal parts of the child, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are covered with Membranes. But I am of Opinion the quickeſt wit in the World cannot conceive how the Soul being abſent and diſtant in place, can animate the yong
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:35070:169"/>one. For ſuppoſe the Womb could work ſome alteration thereupon, through the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes and Excrements of Water, yet could it not cauſe animation.</p>
                  <p>Therefore we muſt needs hold that the Cauſe of Conformation is in the ſeed it ſelf.
<note place="margin">In the ſeed it ſelf is the Cauſe of Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note> Which is the common Opinion of learned Men, viz. of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> 2. <hi>de generat. animal. cap.</hi> 1.3.20. 1. <hi>de generat. animal. cap.</hi> 20.21. 4. <hi>de generat. animal. cap.</hi> 1. and el<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And it hath queſtionleſs ſtrong reaſons to ſupport the ſame. For in the firſt place, ſince Conformation is a Natural act, it proceeds from an Internal principle, not an external. Secondly, conformation begins in the ſeed equally, and al the parts within and without are equally conformed. Thirdly, ſince in Birds which breed Eggs the principle of Conformation is internal, no reaſon can be ſhewed why it ſhould not be ſo in al other Animals.</p>
                  <p>And if you now enquire what that internal Principle is,
<note place="margin">The ſoul is the cauſe of the ſhaping of an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal.</note> no other can be aſſigned ſave the Soul. Some ſay it is <hi>logos Plaſticos,</hi> or a formatwe Underſtanding or Faculty: but unleſs thereby they underſtand the ſoul it ſelf furniſhed with a formative Faculty, this Opinion cannot hold, and hath been ſufficiently refuted before, chap. 5. Others hold it is the Native Heat: but neither is that the principal Cauſe of Formation. For ſo noble an action which al Philoſophers cannot ſufficiently admire, can only be aſcribed to a quality. And heat is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a common Inſtrument, nor can it give to al parts their quantity, figure, and number, and out of queſtion no quality can act unleſs it be directed by a principal and ſuperior faculty, of which there is need in this caſe.</p>
                  <p>Nothing elſe therefore remains which can be the cauſe of Conformation in the Seed, ſave the Soul it ſelf. Which while <hi>Thomas Fienus</hi> denies he is in great Error, <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 5. <hi>concluſ.</hi> 6. and in the firſt place he hath not indeed rightly ſtated the Controverſie.

                        </gap>ne ſtated.</note> For whereas he ought to have diſputed concerning al Souls living, or al Animals, he contrary to the Rules of Demonſtration. goes about to demonſtrate an adjunct of the whol kind of Animals, touching one ſort, viz. Man-kind. For it is not a thing proper to Man alone to generate from ſeed caſt into the Womb, but common to al Creatures which bring forth yong ones alive. And in the beginning of Queſt. 5. he does not rightly form the Queſtion, where he writes. The Queſtion here is not, Whether the Soul brought into the Seed after Conception is the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Cauſe of Conformation? but whether the Soul pre-exiſting in the Seed before the Conception, and bred in the Teſticles of the Parents is the Cauſe. For there is no Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning the latter; but this is the Queſtion in controverſie; Whether the ſeeds of the Male and Female joyned together in the Womb, have an intrinſecal formative Faculty (which he grants) and conſequently a Soul (for that neceſſarily follows) in them.</p>
                  <p>For let us put the caſe that in a Man the Soul is introduced and confuſed by God: yet ſince in Bruits there can be no ſuch Infuſion it muſt needs be preſently in the ſeed, and that communicated from the Parents. And this is ſufficiently proved by one Argument which <hi>Fienus</hi> himſelf brings,
<note place="margin">'Tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the ſoul in the ſeed is the Cauſe of Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note> ſo that there is need of no more, and that is this; that which ſhapes the body is within the Seed, as he proved, Concluſion the third. That which ſhapes is ſome Soul; for ſhaping is a proper power of the Soul. <hi>Ergo,</hi> there is a Soul within the Seed, or a Soul of the Seed: for that which he anſwers (as was ſaid before, chap. 6.) is of no moment. <hi>I confeſs</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>the Premiſes are true. But I deny the Conſequence. It is indeed rightly inferred that there is ſome Soul in the Seed, but not that it is the ſoul of the Seed. There is indeed a Soul brought into the Seed after that the Seed is conceived in the Womb, or planted in the Earth, or the Egg ſet under the Hen, when all things are put into act; but that is not the Soul of the Seed, or which did pre-exiſt in the Seed, or which was bred in the Stones, the Tree, or the Hen, but the Soul of the yong one conceived being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards introduced thereinto.</hi> For ſuppoſe indeed that the Soul is introduced into humane Seed; yet into the Seeds of Plants, the Egs of Hens, and the ſeeds of Bruits, 'tis falſe to hold that the Soul is afterwards introduced, For what introduces the Soul into the ſeed thrown in the ground, what introduces it into an Hens Eggs whiles a Duck ſits over them, or while they are hatched by the heat of a furnace? Here can be no cauſe aſſigned by which the Soul ſhould be introduced. And if the Parents ſhould not give the Soul, but ſome exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal thing, like ſhould not ingender its like. And what need is there I pray you (in this caſe) tomultiply things to no end, and to hold two Souls; one which is the Soul of the Seed, or which did pre-inexiſt in the Seed, and was bred in the Stones, or the Tree, or the Hen, and another introduced afterwards.
<note place="margin">When a Plant is generated.</note> And he contradicts himſelf in this point, whiles in Conclul. 6. he writes: <hi>That the ſhaping of the Seed in the Earth is not eſſential generation it ſelf, but only the perfection of the new Plant already conſtituted and generated upon the Tree; and
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:35070:169"/>the bringing thereof now to a perfect act, which was before conſtituted only in an imperfect act; nor is it any matter what the vulgar people think or call Generation, or what they do not ſo call; nor what agrees to their underſtanding, but what agrees to the Truth. For the common people are ignorant of Philoſophy, and knows not when and where a Plants form is truly produced, nor when is the Eſſential generation of a Plant; and knows not how to diſtinguiſh between the firſt act and the ſecond, betwixt that which is imperfect, and that which is perfect:</hi> and therefore they take one for another; <hi>and conceive that a Plant is then firſt generated when it is perfected and operates, and when it brings forth Roots and Leaves; whoſe production is not the Generation of the Plant, but the operation and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection thereof, being generated before.</hi> So fat <hi>Fienus.</hi> And in very deed if <hi>Fienus</hi> as he rightly underſtood the preſence of the Seed when Conformation it made, ſo he had alſo known the propagation and original thereof he might eaſily have freed himſelf from al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>For although they that think otherwiſe do alleadg many things: yet they can bring no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſolid and firm for their Opinion: which knowing, that they might abuſe the Reader contrary to the Laws of Demonſtration, ſuch things as they ſhould diſpute of the ſeed and formation of Animals in general, thoſe they diſpute in particular touching the Soul and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Man; which when they are examined in general and in their own place they prove of no force. For many being of Opinion that the ſoul of Man is not propagated from his Parents, but infuſed by God when the body is formed, and the ſame being alſo immortal; al thoſe abſurdities which are objected againſt the Animation of Seed from the Prerogative of the Humane Soul do fal to the ground if they be propounded in general ſo as to concern bruit Beaſts alſo. For they are not able to ſhew whence proceeds the ſoul and formation of the Body of an Horſe, a Lyon, a Dog, unleſs the Soul be derived from the Parents with the Seed; nor can they tel us who it is that begins the Delineation of the yong one in al Animals, or why it ſhould be neceſſary that the ſaid Information ſhould be begun by one, and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by another. But eſpecially they are nat able to ſhew how out of the Eggs of Birds yong ones of the ſame kind are hatched, eſpecially by a Bird of another kind ſitting on the ſaid Eggs, or when they are hatched by the heat of a Furnace, unleſs the Soul were already in the Egg. And therefore ſince in Bruit Animals thoſe Arguments are of no force, the moſt of thoſe alſo which are urged concerning the Generation of Man wil alſo be of no force. And although ſome diſtinguiſh betwixt the Conception and the Seed, and cal that white ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance bred in the ſtones the Seed, which is ſhed into the Womb in the time of Copulation; and that Body bred of the Seed in the Womb the Conception, wherein there are ſome linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the future Animal already drawn; yet they themſelves cannot ſhew a Reaſon whence the Soul in Bruits (for here we wil ſet aſide the Humane Soul, thence thereabouts, for the reaſons aforeſaid there is a peculiar diſpute) ſhould come into the Conception, if it were not in the Seed before; nor tel us what cauſe began that firſt delineation and figuration of the parts of every Animal. For whereas <hi>Johannes Gallego de la Serna,</hi> ſaies it proceeds from the Womb, that is altogether falſe. For ſo the Female ſhould only generate, ſince ſhe alone gives the ſoul, and the Male affords only the matter.</p>
                  <p>But let us ſee their Objections. In the firſt place many indeed Object, and therein alſo triumph, That nothing is animated but a body and its parts; but the Seed is an Excrement and a certain ſuperfluous moiſture bred in the ſtones, being juſt like the Chyle in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, the blood in the Liver and Heart, and the milk in the Dugs. But in good deed this Argument of theirs is of no weight, as ſhal be alſo ſhewn hereafter in Chap. 14.

The ſeed is not an excrement.</note> For in the firſt place, they beg the Queſtion, and this very thing is a part thereof, whether only the parts of the body, or the ſeed alſo be animated. For although the Seed is bred in the ſtones, as Chyle in the ſtomach, and is no nutriment of the body; yet it does not thence follow that it is an Excrement. For there is a third thing generated in living Creatures, viz. the fruit or ſeed, cal it which you pleaſe, which the ſeed of Plants does evidently declare. For ſome do make exceptions and ſay, that there is a difference betwixt the ſeeds of Plants and Animals, and that the Seed of Plants is not like the ſeed of Animals, but like the Conception made in the Wombs of Animals. But ſuppoſe it ſo to be; yet thereby is proved, that there is alſo ſomwhat bred in Animals which is neither a part of their Body, nor a Nutriment, nor an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement. Nor does that prove the contrary which <hi>Johannes Gallego de la Serna</hi> objects, <hi>de princip. generat. Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. while he writes that the ſeed of Animals cannot attain to that ultimate diſpoſition to the Introduction of the Soul, which thoſe parts of the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances have attained, which have been turned into the ſubſtance of the parts; and that the ſeed hath only received from its organ aſſimilation, ſuch as the concoctive Faculty was able
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:35070:170"/>to give it, and ſuch as Milk hath received, and that therefore it remains inanimate. For they are meet beggings of the Queſtion, and the ſeed of Plants does demonſtrate the contrary. For if the ſeed of Plants could receive that diſpoſition neceſſary for the propagation of Plants; why cannot the ſeed of Animals receive the ſame? And milk it ſelf which <hi>Johan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Gallego</hi> brings for an example, evidently declares that ſomwhat may be ingendred in the bodies of Animals which is no part of the body nor its Aliment (for the Mother is not nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſhed with the Milk ſhe breeds) nor a meer Excrement: ſuch as ſeed alſo is, which is not therefore bred in the ſtones by the concoctive Faculty only that it might be voided forth as al Excrements are, but therefore and to this end that by it a new Individual might be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,

                     </note> and ſo the kind might be preſerved. And therefore though the Concoctive Faculty does not animate the Seed, as neither in other parts does the aliment receive the Soul from the Coctive Faculty: yet after the Seed hath received from the Concoctive Faculty ſuch a diſpoſition that it can be a fit ſubject for the Soul, the ſoul which is in the animate body does communicate it ſelf thereto as wel in Plants as Animals: which after it is ſeparated from the Parent, by vertue and power of the ſoul which it poſſeſſes and hath received from the Generator it is able to conſtitute a new individual, or particular diſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ct live thing. For in them alſo the ſeed is firſt elaborated by the Concoctive Faculty; and when the ſeed is wel wrought and ripe, then the ſoul communicates it ſelf thereto. The ſame comes to paſs in Animals, nor is there any reaſon to ſhew that it is otherwiſe; ſave that in Ammals as being more perfect there is a more labored preparation, and both the male and the female communicates ſomwhat to the Conſtitution of the yong one; nor is the ſeed caſt into the Earth,
<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the ſeed of Plants and Animals.</note> but into the Womb. Nor let that trouble any one that the ſeed of Animals which bring forth quick yong ones, is of a different Nature from the ſeed of Plants, and that the ſeeds of Plants are wonderouſly and variouſly ſhaped: but the ſeeds of Animals repreſent only a Liquor like milk. For ſeeing the ſeeds of Animals are preſently caſt into the womb of the Mother, and cheriſhed thereby, and therein receive blood neceſſary to nouriſh the yong one; there was no need that they ſhould be ſenced againſt external Injuries, by external co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verings as the ſeeds of Plants and Eggs alſo are.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit in the Womb it ſelf the Seeds of Animals do frame many things which are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the Formation and augmentation of the yong one; ſuch as are the Coats which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold the ſame, the Umbilical or Navel Veſſels, and ſuch things as belong to theſe. Finally, in ſuch Creatures as produce Eggs, becauſe the Eggs were to be kept long before the Chicken are hatched, and that is not performed by the heat of the Womb, but by an external Heat, yet they are covered with ſhels after the ſame manner as the ſeeds of Plants. For Eggs do herein agree with the ſeeds of Plants, that as in Plants to the marrow or pap which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the ſeed, other things are added either to guard the ſeed, or to make food for Man-kind, or for other uſes; ſo alſo in Eggs other things are found beſides the true ſeed. Which does even hereby appear, That the Eggs which the Hens lay untrodden by the Cock have al that is food in Eggs, yet are they unfruitful becauſe they want the ſeed of the male. Which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens alſo in Inſects. Al female Silkworms without difference yield Eggs: but ſuch as have not coupled with the male al their Eggs or ſeeds are unfruitful. Yet this difference there is betwixt the ſeeds of Plants and Eggs, that of thoſe things which are added to the true ſeed, the Plant is neither formed, nor noutiſhed, nor augmented; but the ſeed draws nouriſhment to it ſelf out of the ground, ſave that (as was ſaid before in Chap. 8.) the firſt rudiments of the tender Plant do draw their Nutriment out of ſome part of the Pulp; but Eggs, becauſe without the Womb and out of the Earth, they become a perfect Animal, and the ſeed (of which at firſt the Chick is formed) is covered with a ſhel that it can draw nothing from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out: in the Egg there lies already ſo much matter as may ſuffice to perfect the Chick til ſuch time as it is hatched.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctians of</hi> Joh. Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go.</note> 
                     <hi>Johan. Gallego de la Serna, Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de princip. ſem. cap.</hi> 5. promiſes that he wil prove that the Seed is only a material principle of Generation, that no man unleſs he be blockiſh and ſtubborn, wil hereafter dare to deny the ſame. But he performs not his great Promiſes,
<note place="margin">In what ſenſe the ſeed is more Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect than the Generator.</note> and thoſe are ſleight Arguments which he brings. For in the firſt place he ſaies that the Seed is much more imperfect than the Generator, and the yong one to be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. For it is a certain Excrement of the Generator. But I anſwer, That the ſeed alſo of Plants which he grants to be animated, is more imperfect than the Generator and the Plants generated therefrom, not becauſe it hath no ſoul, but becauſe it hath no formed Organs which lie hid nevertheleſs aptitudinally in the ſeed, which contains in it an Idea or Plat-form of them, and they are fabricated by the Soul it ſelf. But that the Seed ſhould be only an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement was before refuted.</p>
                  <pb n="507" facs="tcp:35070:170"/>
                  <p> Again, He conceits that the virtue of the ſame ſort cannot be received in a matter of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct ſort. But the form of the ſeed differs from the form of any Individual of what ſort ſoever. But he does not rightly underſtand the nature of Seed. True indeed it is the ſoul cannot perſiſt in a perfect manner, nor laſt long ſave in a body fit for it, and furniſhed with ſuch Organs as it hath need of, but that it cannot be propagated by a different body, viz. the ſeed, and abide therein ſo long til it have generated and built a Body for it ſelf, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience it ſelf teaches that to be falſe, and he himſelf granted as much before in Plants. For there is indeed one ſoul in the ſeed, and in the Animal ingendred thereby: but yet that which is in the Animal differs not from that in the ſeed, ſave in the accomodation and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Organs. Verily neither the ſeeds of Plants, nor the Bulbs, nor the Rootes, nor the Branches (if you conſider the perfection of Organs) are of the ſame condition with perfect Plants, for example ſake, the ſeed and bulb of an Onion after a ſort is not a perfect Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the ſeed of Poppy after a ſort is not an entire Poppy Plant; the Branch of a Pear Tree is not a perfect Pear Tree: yet in all theſe there is the perfect ſoul belonging to that ſort of Plant. Nor is the matter in the ſeed and that in the young one of a different but of one and the ſame ſort.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Gallego</hi> does alſo very much urge this Argument, 1. <hi>de princip. Generat. Lib.</hi> 3.
<note place="margin">Whether the Organs introduce the ſoul.</note> 
                     <hi>Cap.</hi> 18. when a thing is by Nature &amp; Art ſo made for ſome other thing that the latter cannot exiſt without the former, it muſt needs be that <hi>that</hi> which is made for the neceſſity of another ſhould go before it in time. But the matter and all its diſpoſitions are for the form: <hi>Ergo</hi> they ought to precede the ſame in time. For the form ſhould never be united to the matter ſave for the Inſtrumental actions, <hi>Ergo</hi> the Organs and neceſſary Inſtruments ought to precede before the Introduction of the form, and the whol preparation of the matter neceſſary for the actions of the ſoul cannot any waies be made by the ſame form whoſe actions they are, but by the Agent to which the whol work of Generation is committed. For to the ſame Agent to which it belongs to Introduce the form into the new matter, it belongs alſo before its Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſo to prepare the matter that by no means it can be received in another, nor the matter it ſelf can receive the active form. But both the Major ſimply taken and the Minor are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true, and the proof thereof is falſe. That the Minor is falſe, both the formation of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Plants, and Nutrition and Augmentation of Animals do teach. For firſt of all, when the ſeed of a Plant is caſt into the Earth, or a Branch or Root or Bulb is ſet therein, there is no other Agent which can firſt form the Body and Inſtruments ſit for the ſoul, but the ſoul in the Seed, Bulb or Branch, does firſt form the Roots, by which it draws out of the Earth convenient matter to form a body fit for it ſelf, and of it forms the parts of its own body. Why then ſhould not the ſame thing be done in Animals? Yea the thing it ſelf tels us that the ſame is done. For the ſeed being received into the Womb, the Soul firſt forms the Membranes in which the ſeed is included, and then the umbilical Veſſels by which it draws blood neceſſary to form the body withall. Which thing alſo Eggs do teſtifie, which being cheriſhed by any heat whatſoever Birds are thence produced. Where no cauſe can be ſo much as imagined which ſhould fit the matter to receive the ſoul ſave the ſoul it ſelf which is in the Egg. Again, The proof of the Minor is falſe, which builds upon that never granted Hypotheſis, that after the ultimate diſpoſition of the matter then the ſoul is educed and ſprings forth. This indeed is true, that al the organization (as he phraſes it) is for the form, that is to ſay, that the form may have ſit Inſtruments whereby to act; but that the ſoul could not be there in its firſt act before it can perfectly operate by the Organs can no waies be proved.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Others object that if the ſeed of an Animal (for example of an Horſe) hath actually the ſoul in it, the ſeed of an Horſe is an Horſe; ſince the form of a thing being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, three things are ſuppoſed, the Eſſence of that thing, the Name, and the Operation thereof. But here is no conſequence at all. We grant indeed that the Eſſence of a thing does chiefly depend upon the Soul, and conſequently the denomination, and that from it the operations flow: yet the ſoul is not the whol thing, but a part thereof. And therefore the other part being wanting, viz. the organical body, the ſoul cannot be called an Animal.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, Some do Glory in this Argument, viz. that it is a metaphyſical Principle,
<note place="margin">Whether the ſeed be actually a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated?</note> that the ſame thing cannot be at once actually and potentially. Since therefore the ſeed is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentially an Animal, it cannot be actually an Animal. But there is no ſtrength in this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For not to diſpute in this place of the genuine ſence of that metaphyſical Axiom, ſince the ſame thing in divers reſpects may be ſaid to be both actually and potentially: I ſhall only ſpeak to that, whereas the ſeed is ſaid to be potentially an Animal; and I Anſwer, That this Argument is drawn from Authority, and that which upon a like occaſion the moſt
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:35070:171"/>learned <hi>Thomas Fienus</hi> ſaid from <hi>Plato</hi>'s Charmides; it is not to be regarded what any man ſaies, but whether he ſpeaks true or not. Again ſaving the Authority of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> the moſt renowned <hi>Caſparus Hofmannus</hi> hath wel written, as before we hinted more than once, <hi>In tract. de formarum Origine, rat.</hi> 2. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath ſo often ſaid that the ſeed is an Act, that it is the part of a very unskilful Perſon to urge only thoſe places where he ſaies it is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential. For ſeeing (as was ſaid before) that which moves is actually, but the animated ſeed actually moves, certainly the ſeed muſt have a certain act which moves. This act is <hi>that ſame beginning of Generation and Motion</hi> (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> cals it) 1. <hi>de Generat. An. cap.</hi> 2. <hi>and the beginning of the ſhape which turns the Courſes into its own likeneſs.</hi> 1. <hi>de gener. animal. cap.</hi> 20. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. <hi>de Gen. cap.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>de part. animal cap.</hi> 1. And left any ſhould feign I know not what ſpermatick Principle (of which we ſpake <hi>cap.</hi> 5.) different from the Soul, he terms this Punciple, <hi>a member or part of the Animal, which is immediately in the Seed,</hi> 2. <hi>de gen. anim. cap.</hi> 1. And whereas <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſomtimes ſaies, that the ſeed is poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially animated; this he therefore ſaid, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> wel obſerves <hi>Exercit.</hi> 6. <hi>ſect.</hi> 7. not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it needs another ſubſtance to draw forth and perfect the ſame (for ſo it were but begun) but becauſe it wants perfect Inſtruments which are in its power to make. Which alſo <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barella</hi> held, who (<hi>de Mente humana cap</hi> 9) expreſly writes, that the Seed hath a Soul potentially, becauſe its ſoul does not yet work by its proper Organs.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, They ſay if the Soul frames its own Manſion houſe, (as is aſſerted) Why does it not preſently frame the ſame in the ſeminary Veſſels? But let them tel us, why the Soul of a Dog does not ſee in the Dogs Tail, nor produce Seed, nor form a Body in the ſame place. For where the Place and Organ is wanting, there no Operation can be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly,
<note place="margin">What is the moſt common action of the ſoul.</note> They ſay if the ſeed is actually animated, why is there no nutrition diſcerned therein, which is the moſt common action of the Soul? But it is denied that nutrition is the moſt common action of the ſoul, for vivification is its moſt common action. For Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion belongs only to the Body already formed, and when Nutriment is at hand. Hence the ſeed of Barly, Whear, or other Grain lives in the Granary, which <hi>Johannes Gallego</hi> does grant, but it is not nouriſhed, becauſe it is not in a convenient place wherein it may be che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and receive aliment.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly,
<note place="margin">Whether ſouls are united.</note> They object if the ſeed be animated and both the Parents contribute the ſame, the ſoul wil be a thing compounded of the ſoul of the Father, and the ſoul of the Mother. But mixtion and compoſition as hath formerly been ſaid does only belong to things of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſorts; but if things joyn which are of the ſelf ſame ſort there is no compoſition; nor is the fire which ariſes from many flames united called compound: and the example of Palmes was formerly alleadged out of <hi>Scaliger.</hi> And that example alſo <hi>Fort. Licetus</hi> (<hi>de perfecta conſtitutione hominis in utero chap.</hi> 8.) alleadges; that by ingrafting when a branch is put into the trunk of a Tree, two and ſomtimes more ſouls do joyn, and yet the Tree is but one, and hath but one ſoul. Whence that fals to ground which ſome do urge touching the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migration of two Eſſences, and the ſubſiſtence of two Eſſences in one, which they count abſurd. For all theſe things are true only of compleat Eſſences and which can ſub. ſift of themſelves; but not of thoſe which are ordanied to make up the perfection of one thing.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly,
<note place="margin">Whether the Parent in genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion loſes any of his ſoul:</note> Whereas they count it abſurd that many ſouls ſhould proceed from one Parent, and that the Parent in every time of copulation ſhould loſe a part of his ſoul, all this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from their ignorance of the nature of the ſoul. The ſoul (as hath been ſaid before) hath no parts properly ſo called, and it is deprived of no part thereof, but remaining ſtil the ſame does variouſly multiply it ſelf. For though one Tree in one Summer do produce a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Apples, and each Apple hath ſundry ſeeds, and out of each of them a like Apple-tree wil grow: yet the ſoul of the Apple-tree is not diminiſhed but remains totally the ſame. And the ſame holds in Animals. And therefore it is more decent to ſearch and admire the wonderful works of God than to calumniate the ſame. And all thoſe abſurdities which are objected againſt the wonderful work of Generation are nothing but diſparagements of the works of God proceeding from Ignorance.</p>
                  <p>Finally, That the ſeed is animated, <hi>Thomas Fienus</hi> does (<hi>de format. faet. queſt.</hi> 5.) thus Impugn: Neither the Blood (ſaies he) nor the Spirits are animated: <hi>ergo,</hi> not the Seed. He proves the Conſequence becauſe they are produced in parts much more noble than the Stones are, viz. in the Heart, the Brain, the Liver, which if they could not impart the ſoul to the Blood and Spirits, neither can the ſtones. But the Principal parts have their dignity. And therefore although the Liver, Heart, Brain, do generate Blood and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits:
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:35070:171"/>yet for the Generation of Animals the ſtones have a peculiar ſeed-making faculty, ſuch as no other parts have, that of the blood and ſpirits bred in other parts they may form a peculiar matter which is the fit ſubject for the ſoul to be propagated in, which is termed Seed, which is much more excellent than the Blood fince it is the fruit of an Animal, and the Blood is only the nutriment.</p>

                  <p>ANd hitherto we have demonſtrated by firm reaſons (as I conceive) that Plants and bruit Animals are generated by Seed which hath a Soul in it communicated from the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator; which lying hid in the Seed forms it ſelf a fit Manſion houſe according to the kind of Plant or Animal from whence it came. It remains that we ſpeak of the Generation of Man,
<note place="margin">Divers Opinions touching the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of the Soul of Man. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of what is to be ſaid of the origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant ſouls.</note> concerning which Authors are of divers Opinons. Some had rather ſuſpend their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments than determine any thing in ſo difficult a matter. Others hold that as the Body, ſo the Soul of Man is propagated from the Parents into the Children by vertue of the Divine Benediction. Others conceive that new Souls are created for every perſon by God, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed into their Bodies aſter they are formed, and ſo they aſcribe the production of Souls immediately to God. As to the firſt Opinion, I acknowledg indeed the difficulty of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and I confeſs that it is here dangerous to determine any thing. Howbeit ſince in matters difficult 'tis praiſe-worthy to do a mans endeavor, and we ought to labor with al our might to know the Truth, ſetting aſide the firſt Opinion we ſhal examine and weigh the two latter. And in the firſt place I am not indeed ignorant what Priviledges the Soul of Man hath, viz. To it alone immortality is granted by God, which is denied to the Beaſts, and it alone ſhal be partaker or eternal Bleſſedneſs. But whether the Propagation thereof by the Seed can derogate any thing from this Prerogative of Mans Soul is a queſtion. Nor would I (truly) hereabouts hatefully contend with any man, but I allow every man to abound in his own ſence, and to enjoy his own Underſtanding; but if I may ſpeak my own mind, there are three things which lie me in hand to prove. Firſt that it is more probable and likely that the Soul of Man is propagated from his Parents by vertue of the Divine Benediction. The Second is, That whether we hold the Soul to be created and infuſed, or to be propagated and traduced from the Parents; yet nevertheleſs we muſt hold that the Soul is preſent in the Seed at the firſt conception, and when the ſeed of the Father and Mother are joyned together in the Womb and retained, and as ſoon as ever the work of ſhaping the Body begins, and that no other efficient Cauſe can be aſſigned which performs the work of Conformation, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Humane Soul it ſelf. Thirdly, though I know great Authors differ in this point, yet (if ſetting aſide Authority, Reaſon ſhal be only conſidered) I ſhal demonſtrate, That ſcarce any ſolid Reaſon can be brought againſt the Propagation of the Humane Soul by the Seed. And whereas this point is diſputed both with Philoſophical and Theological Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, I ſhal not put my Sickle into other Mens Corn, but uſe only Philoſophical Arguments. And if any man wil defend the other Opinion by Theological Reaſons it concerns him to ſee and ſhew how theſe Arguments may be anſwered. Which if he ſhal do I wil not be wilful in defending mine own Opinion, but ſhal willingly follow him that ſhews me better. In the mean time, and til that be done, as far as I am able to judg in this darkneſs and weakneſs of Humane Underſtanding I cannot think otherwiſe. But I give others free leave to think otherwiſe. For I deſire not to be a Dictator, but only to propound my Opinion as wel as others do theirs.</p>
                  <p>Now that the Soul is propagated from the Parents into the Children by the Seed is firſt hereby proved, in that (as was ſaid before) like begets its like.
<note place="margin">The Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſoul is propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by the ſeed.</note> Which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> evidently ſhews, 2. <hi>de Anima, chap.</hi> 4. <hi>text.</hi> 34. where he thus ſpeaks: <hi>This Operation is of all others moſt natural to living things; I mean to ſuch living things as are perfect, not mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and which are not born without ſeed: every thing I ſay to beget another like it ſelf, an Animal an Animal, a Plant a Plant, that thus they may continue alwaies, and attain as much as may be a Divine Condition.</hi> For ſince God made every thing in its kind perfect, but Man moſt perfect of al; verily he could not be called perfect, but ſhould according to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> be reckoned amongſt maimed things if he could not beget another like himſelf, and that intire. And therefore both according to Philoſophers and Divines, Man ingenders Man, and the whol Man an whol Man, which could not be if the Generator did not communicate the Soul. For ſince a Man conſiſts of Body and Soul, if the Soul ſhould not be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:35070:172"/>by the Parents, a Man ſhould not engender a Man. Alſo that a Man communicates his ſoul to his Child is altogether agreeable to the holy Scriptures. For God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.18. ſaid to Man (as wel as other Creatures) when he bleſſed him, <hi>Encreaſe ye and multiply:</hi> by vertue of which Benediction the whol Man ingenders an whol Man; which could not be if the Soul were infuſed from without. Of which more largely in Chap. 11. For what ever pertains to the Eſſential Integrity of a Man that is propagated by Generation. But not only the Body, but the Soul pertains to the Integrity or entire being of a Man. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Soul alſo is propagated by Generation. Whence alſo <hi>Damaſcen, Lib</hi> 4. <hi>de Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxa fide, cap.</hi> 7. defines Generation to be the Procreation of an Individual of like ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance by the Copulation of a Man and a Woman. Nor is the beginning of the Soul of Man to be fetched from Creation. For every thing that is created is not immortal. Yea, rather whatever is created is of it ſelf mortal. And that ſome things are mortal, others immortal, proceeds not from the condition of Nature, but from the moſt free good pleaſure of God; who created what he pleaſed, when he pleaſed, and how he pleaſed. And ſuch is the Nature of Man, as God would have it to be; and it is ſo propagated, retaining its Eſſence given by God, even as he pleaſed.</p>
                  <p>But let every man hold here as he pleaſes,
<note place="margin">The hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſoul is preſent at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</note> and let him beleeve that the ſoul is infuſed on propagated: yet this (in the ſecond place) I conceive to be moſt certain, That the Soul is preſent immediately upon the firſt Conception as ſoon as the ſeed of the Man and Woman are joyned and retained in the Mothers Womb, and the body begins to be ſhaped; and he that holds the contrary, whether he ſtand for the Propagation, or for the Infuſion of the Soul, he is in an Error. For there are in the firſt place ſome of them who hold that the Rational Soul is not immediately created and infuſed by God,
<note place="margin">The hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſoul is not edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced out of the power of the matter.</note> but propagated from the Parents, who notwithſtanding ſlip back into that vulgar Opinion of the School-men concerning the Educti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Forms, and hold, That the Soul does not at firſt lie hid in the Seed actually, but only potentially, and when the ſeed is ſomwhat wrought, and the members of the body are in ſome meaſure delineated, that then at laſt by the formative faculty inherent in the ſeed the Soul is educed out of the power of the matter excited and kindled, ſo that whereas before it only lay hid potentially, now it begins actually to be, to live, and to inform its body.</p>
                  <p>But all which hath been formerly alleadged, Chap. 4. and 5. againſt the Eduction of Forms out of the power of matter and the formative Principle in the ſeed do make alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Opinion, which it is needleſs to repeat in this place; only I think fit to produce here what is alleadged by <hi>Balthazar Meiſnerus,</hi> in <hi>Philoſoph. ſobr. part.</hi> 1. <hi>ſect.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 1. And to omit his other Theological Reaſons which he brings, many Inconveniencies and abſurdities follow from this Opinion. For in the firſt place an accident, viz The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative power which is in the ſecond rank of Qualities ſhould produce ſo noble and excellent a ſubſtance, which is abſurd. Secondly, the formative faculty ſhould be without a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. For the Prolifick Faculty is not a faculty of the ſeed, but of the ſoul. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where there is no ſoul there can be no prolifick faculty unleſs we would have an accident to be without its ſubject. Again, this faculty in the ſeed is either corruptible, or not. If you ſay it is not, then the ſeed being corrupted either it paſſes into the ſoul newly produced, or elſe to ſome other place. But neither of theſe can be. Not the former, becauſe the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers inherent in the ſoul are produced thereby, but do not produce it. How abſurd were it therefore to ſay that the formative faculty does firſt raiſe the Soul out of the ſeed, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards inſinuate it ſelf thereinto, and flow therefrom? Not the latter, becauſe either it would go away by it ſelf, or paſs into another ſubject. The former is contrary to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of accidents which do not ſubſiſt ſeparated: and the latter is improbable, becauſe no ſubject can be named to which it mixes it ſelf. Therefore that Formative Faculty muſt needs be corruptible; which being granted, it follows that the Soul it ſelf is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible and mortal: for an incorruptible thing cannot be generated out of a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible.</p>
                  <p>But thoſe who hold the Creation and Infuſion of the Soul do al of them conceive that the Soul is not infuſed at the firſt Conception, but when the body is formed.</p>
                  <p>But they who ſetting aſide Authority and anticipated Opinions are willing diligently to weigh and conſider the matter it ſelf, cannot otherwiſe hold than that the ſoul of man is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent immediately after the firſt Conception,
<note place="margin">The ſoul of a Man is preſent at the firſt conception.</note> and as ſoon as a Mans body begins to be formed. And for the proof thereof I wil uſe the ſame Argument which formerly I uſed in general to prove the preſence of the Soul in the Seed. viz. Where ever the operations of the Humane Soul are, there that muſt of neceſſity be preſent. But at the firſt Conception the operations
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:35070:172"/>of the Humane Soul are forthwith preſent: <hi>ergo</hi> the Humane Soul is there alſo. Now theſe Operations are firſt the formation of the membranes which infold the Child, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward the ſhaping of the Child is ſelf, which (as afterwards ſhal be ſaid) begins at the firſt Conception. Afterward the augmentation of the Child it ſelf. For ſure it is, as ſoon as the parts of the Child are delineated they begin to grow. But in growing the Soul is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the parts which are added to the Body. Therefore alſo in the firſt augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the parts which accrew muſt needs be animated. And abſurd it were that the child being born ſhould be augmented by one Soul, and in the Womb by another.</p>
                  <p>The moſt renowned <hi>Thomas Fienus,</hi> Profeſſor of Phyſick in the Univerſity of <hi>Lovaine,</hi>

                        <hi>The O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of</hi> Thomas Fienus <hi>concerning the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the ſoul in a child in the womb. The Coats of the child in the womb are formed by the ſoul</hi>
                     </note> was moved (<hi>de form. foet. quaeſt.</hi> 8. <hi>Concluſ.</hi> 11.) by the force (doubtleſs) of this Argument to diſſent from al thoſe who hold the ſoul to be infuſed, and that not til about the fortieth day after Conception, and to hold that the Rational Soul is infuſed the third day after the Conception of the Seed: which he proves by theſe Arguments. Firſt, That which ſhapes the child ſhapes the membranes; but that which ſhapes the membranes ought to be the third day in the Seed. Therefore the Rational Soul ought to be about the third day in the Seed. For that which ſhapes the membranes ought to be in the ſeed before they be ſhaped, or at the ſame time when they begin to be ſhaped; ſince every Efficient Cauſe is in time before, or together with the Effect. But the membranes are ſhaped at the furtheſt on the fift or ſixt day. Therefore they begin to be ſhaped on the third day at leaſt; and therefore the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Soul ought to be in the ſeed at leaſt on the third day. For two or three daies at leaſt ſeem requiſite to perfect the ſame; ſince they have a ſtructure artificial enough, and little Veins and Arteries running through their ſubſtance which cannot be formed in a moment of time.</p>
                  <p>Now that what forms the Child does alſo form the membranes, he thus proves: Beings are not raſhly and without neceſſity to be multiplied. Now one and the ſame ſoul can perform al the Conformation which is requiſite to the ſeed. For al parts are begun at one and the ſame time though al do not ſo ſoon appear perfect. And therefore more than one Soul to ſhape is needleſs. Nor can any other ſoul or vertue be aſſigned which might form theſe membranes ſave the Rational Soul in the ſeed, which in <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 8. he proves at large. Yea, and he further ſhews that it is the Office of the ſame formative faculty which makes the child to make the membranes alſo. For in the firſt place the membranes are ſhaped for the childs ſake, and the Seed is covered with them leſt it ſhould be defiled by the filth of the Womb, and the Menſtrual blood, leſt the ſeed ſhould run about and ſlip out of the Womb, and that the ſpirits therein might not exhale. Secondly, the Membranes are formed of the ſame matter that the child is formed of, viz. of the ſeed, and conſequently of the ſame for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative Faculty. Thirdly, the membranes live, <hi>ergo</hi> are formed by the ſame ſoul where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they live. Fourthly, the Navel Veſſels are formed by the ſame cauſe the child is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by; <hi>ergo</hi> the membranes alſo. For the Membranes ought fitly to be joyned to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel Veſſels, and the Navel Veſſels ought to be cloathed by them, and to perforate and go through them. But that union and connexion cannot be made by different formative facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And ridiculous it were to think that the membranes are not made by any formative fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, but are only bred by the heat of the womb as the cruſt of a Loaf by the Ovens heat, and the skin upon milk by the heat of the fire. For the generation of the membranes and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction and connexion with the Navel Veſſels is far more artificial than that it can be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed only by the drying of the fire; nor is it made by neceſſity of the matter, but it is ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially intended by Nature, as without which there could be no Child made of the Seed.</p>
                  <p>Nowthat the Membranes are made the fift or ſixt day, Experience it ſelf,
<note place="margin">The mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes are made pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Phyſitians does witneſs; as appears from <hi>Hippocrates, Lib. de Natura pueri,</hi> where he ſpeaks of the dancing Wench who caſt a Conception out of her Womb the fixt day after it was conceived being covered with a Membrane; <hi>Galen,</hi> 1. <hi>de ſem. cap.</hi> 4. where he writes that frequently three or four daies after Conception the ſeed it ſelf comes away covered with a Coat: And <hi>Macrobius,</hi> in <hi>ſom. Scipionis, Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. and al obſervations of later Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians confirm the ſame. Secondly, he proves the ſame hereby, becauſe towards the Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the Soul (he ſpeaks according to his own ſuppoſition, or elſe he would have ſaid propagation) there needs no other action then that ſeeds ſhould be mixed in the womb by the vertue and heat thereof, and be there fermented and actuated. And to ſuch a mixture fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation and actuation there needs no long delay of time. For Nature (truly) is not idle a moment, but begins to work as ſoon as the ſeed is conceived. And when the laſt diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (he ſpeaks again according to his own Hypotheſis) are induced to the Introduction of
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:35070:173"/>the Soul, there is no further need of any other great alteration or elaboration thereof in the Womb. Which he proves by the example of the Seeds of Plants upon which the ultimate diſpoſitions are ſo imprinted that often of their own accord they begin to ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For in the firſt Concluſion he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ightly proves, That neither God, nor Intelligences, nor the Soul of the World, were the efficient Cauſes of Conformation; in the ſecond, That the formative faculty is not in the Womb; in the third. That the conformative faculty is in the Seed, and that it is intrinſecal thereunto; in the fourth, That the Native heat is not the principal efficient cauſe of Conformation; in the fift, That the Generative Faculty of the Parents is not the efficient cauſe of the conformation or changing of the ſeed in the Womb; in the ninth, That the Rational Soul is the firſt and only Soul in the Seed, and that no other does precede the ſame; in the tenth, That the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Soul in Man does ſhape its own body, and give the ſame its form; in the eleventh, That the Rational Soul is preſent about the third day after Conception. And thus from the formation of the Child he perceived evidently and cleerly, that the whol formation thereof was begun, continued, and perfectly accompliſhed by one and the ſame ſoul about the third day, yea, in the end of the ſecond, or rather (ſince Nature is not a moment idle) as ſoon as ever the ſeeds are mixed in the Womb. Which is a thing ſo manifeſt that al who hold the contrary muſt needs fal into moſt abſurd Opinions.</p>
                  <p>But ſince even before the third day (as we ſhal ſhew anon) certain operations and ſome formation is made,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Wherein</hi> Flenus <hi>comes ſhort.</hi>
                     </note> he does not ſhew what cauſes that formation, either in Man, or in Bruits. Moreover, his Arguments do only prove, That the Rational Soul of a man is preſent ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the beginning of Formation: but they do not prove, That the Soul of a Man is about the third day infuſed, or rather (as he phrazes it) increated by God. For although it be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently demonſtrated, That the Rational Soul of a Man is preſent at the beginning of the ſhaping of the child; yet another Queſtion does now ariſe, viz. Whether it be propagated? or whether it be infuſed by God, and by him created in the ſeed diſpoſed for it.
<note place="margin">Fienus <hi>his alſe Concluſion.</hi>
                     </note> Where he brings no Arguments nor Reaſons for his Opinion, and his other Propoſitions wherein he differs from my Opinion, viz. The ſixt, That the Soul of the Seed is not the efficient Cauſe of Conformation; the ſeventh, That in the Seed as it is Seed, and as it is in the Stones, and before it hath received the Soul in the Womb, there is no active vertue of Conformation or Generation; and that the Seed is not an Inſtrument in Generation, or an efficient, but only a material Cauſe; and that in neither of the Parents ſeed there is any active principle of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, but only paſſive; the Eighth, That the Efficient of Conformation is the ſoul which comes into the ſeed after Conception: al theſe I ſay ſpring from that Hypotheſis, viz. That the Rational is infuſed by God: had it not been for which he would doubtleſs have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the preſence of the Soul in the Seed. Which Hypotheſis nevertheleſs is built upon Authorities and no ſound Reaſon, as ſhal hereafter appear; nor do the Patrons thereof bring any ſubſtantial proof for it, but only fly to that of <hi>Juſtus Lipſius,</hi> who when (<hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Phyſiolog. Stoic. cap.</hi> 7.) he had produced the Authority of <hi>Tertullian</hi> and many Latines, who held that the Soul was bred in the ſeed, and did not enter into the ſame, and had praiſed <hi>Gregory Nyſſen,</hi> who ſaid none in his wits could think that the original of the Soul was later than the Conſtitution of the Body, he concludes: <hi>That it was an Opinion which might be maintained, had not the Church the purer ſort of Divines agreed to beleeve otherwiſe: and therefore we muſt obey.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that which moved <hi>Lipſius</hi> to deny the propagation of the Humane ſoul by the ſeed, and rather to hold that it was infuſed, that doubtleſs hath moved others alſo, and amongſt them the renowned <hi>Marcus Marci,</hi> who if he would have contended only with Phyſical Reaſons, queſtionleſs he would have granted the propagation of the Humane Soul by ſeed. Which appears in that, in <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Ideae Idearum operatric. cap.</hi> 4. he writes: And if any one would bring a reaſon of this diverſity (viz. That the ſouls of Bruits are propagated with the ſeed, and not of Men) I refer that man to the Omnipotency of the Creator, who gives to al things not only ſuch a faculty as is agreeable to their nature, but alſo their manner, time, number, order, and certain limits. But the Queſtion is not here what God can do, yea, and what he hath done. But it is only pre-ſuppoſed and not proved, that God wil not have the Soul of Man propagated by ſeed; nor if that were held, does it import any abſurdity; which does even by that appear which he afterwards adds. But nothing hindred if the Creator had
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:35070:173"/>ſo thought fit, but that the Soul of Man might have been ſo faſtened to the ſeed that it alſo might be frequently multiplied and born again as it were in particular perſons. But the reaſons formerly produced do prove, That it ſo pleaſed the Creator, nor are there any ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient reaſons to prove, that God would not have it ſo. <hi>Marcus Marci</hi> endeavors indeed to prove that, when he adds: Yet becauſe it was inconvenient that a Man ſhould be ſo born, and diſagreeable to the end for which he was created, the omnipotent goodneſs would not have it ſo. For the ſouls of Bruits tend only to adorn this world, and becauſe through their corruptible Nature they cannot hold out in one Individual they diffuſe themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many, that one ſucceeding another, that variety may be preſerved. But the ſoul of Man does not only adorn this temporary Scene of the World, but is co-heir with the bleſſed Spirits of the Eternal World to come. Whence of neceſſity (the act of this life being fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed) it is transferred into that ſame eternal Life which wil make it either happy or miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And in caſe there were but one ſoul in al, the ſame at the reſurrection of the body ſhould be happy and miſerable, beloved and hated of God. But I conceive theſe reaſons are not of ſufficient weight. Nor does the propagation of the humane Soul by the Seed make it incapable of another life, nor does it thence follow that there ſhould be one ſoul of al either now or hereafter. For he himſelf grants that the Creator could have cauſed the humane ſoul to be multiplied in the Individuals. But the holy Scriptures ſhew that God nor only could, but would have it ſo, when they teach that God commanded that not only other Animals but Man alſo ſhould beget his like, and multiply himſelf into Individuals; and the actions themſelves which appear in the ſeed, and other reaſons fore-alleadged do prove that ſeveral Individual perſons have their ſeveral Souls, which being immortal ſhal neither be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed after death, nor ſhal grow into one, but each at the laſt day ſhal be reſtored to its Body.</p>
                  <p>And if (as I hinted before) <hi>Fienus</hi> and other learned men who have written of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the yong one had ſought the cauſe of the formation of a living body,
<note place="margin">The ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of a living be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy common to all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving things.</note> not in Man as being too narrow a ſubject, but in general in al living things, Plants, and Animals, they had more eaſily found out the truth. For when (Queſt. 5.) <hi>Fienus</hi> was neceſſitated to grant that the ſeed o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Plants is animated he ought in the next place to have enquired how it is with the ſeed of Bruits whether it is animated or not, and what therein is the cauſe of the Conformation of an animate body. And ſince he himſelf grants that Conformation begins preſently after Conception is made (and he ſolidly proves there is no other cauſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation but the ſoul, and the ſoul of Bruits is not infuſed from Heaven) he might thence have eaſily collected both that the ſeed of Bruits is animated, and that the ſoul therein is the Cauſe of the Conformation of the body. But ſeeing thoſe things which he objects againſt the preſence of the Humane Soul in the Seed do alſo oppoſe that of the ſeed of Bruits, he ought to have conſidered how they ſhould be anſwered. For if he had done this he would eaſily have ſeen how thoſe doubts which are objected againſt the preſence of the Humane Soul in the ſeed might have been anſwered. One thing only had remained for him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite into, viz. Whether in the point of propagation the Humane Soul hath any thing pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to it ſelf, which the bruit Animals have not: and ſince the formation of the members (which himſelf makes an argument of the preſence of the Soul) begins not on the third day, but at the firſt moment of Conception, he ought to have proved why that formation ſhould not be a ſign of the ſouls preſence.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, neither do the Arguments of <hi>Fienus</hi> prove this,
<note place="margin">Fienus <hi>dots not prove that the Soul is not in the Seed before the third day.</hi>
                     </note> that the ſoul is not preſent in the ſeed before the third day. For ſeeing as he grants, Nature is not idle a moment; but begins to work as ſoon as the ſeed is conceived and the operations begin to be performed in the ſeed after the firſt moment of Conception immediately, and as <hi>Galen</hi> hath it 1. <hi>de ſem. cap.</hi> 4. three or four daies after the Conception the ſeed is already incloſed in a Membrane, and the Membranes (as <hi>Fienus</hi> proves) are formed by the ſame ſoul: it is truly neceſſarily concluded, that the ſoul was preſent before the third day, and had begun the work of her formation of the humane body. The obſervations of Abortions do conclude the ſame. <hi>Hippocrates de nat. Pueri,</hi> writes that he ſaw a Conception retained ſix daies in the Womb, and then came away, which was thus qualified, as if a man ſhould take off the outward hard ſhel from a raw Egg, ſo that the humor contained within might be diſcerned through the thin skin. After this manner was that liquor diſpoſed, and it was morever red and round. Alſo there were ſeen white &amp; thin ſibres contained in the Membrane, with a red thick bloody water, and the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane it ſelf on the outſide was died with blood reſembling the colour of ſuch as have ſtained faces. In the midſt whereof there was a certain ſmal extant which ſeemed to me to be the Navil, and that it firſt breathed therethrough, and from thence was drawn a Membrane
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:35070:174"/>which imbraced the whol ſeed. And the ſame <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his Book <hi>de Carnibus,</hi> ſaies that he Conception hath upon the ſeventh day all that it becomes the Body to have; and that an Abortion made at this time being put into water does ſhew to him that ſhal diligently view all things the rudiments of all the parts of the Body. In like manner <hi>Felix Platerus</hi> writes in <hi>Quaeſt. med. quaeſt.</hi> 1. that for many years he had ſeen many abortions which in the firſt week were juſt after that manner: Firſt of all (ſaies he) that ſame procreative faculty which lay hid in the ſeed does rouſe it ſelf and diſpoſes thoſe more remarkable portions of the ſeed which flowed from the three Principal parts of the Parents into three Bladders as it were, ſwelling with ſpirits, which are Rudiments of the Brain, Heart, and Liver, ſhut up in a ſmal body: and the other portions adhering thereunto it rudely ſeparates into Limbs and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers growing thereto, which are commonly perfected in the firſt week, ſo that the Embryon being at that time caſt out by abortion, ſuch a ſhapeleſs ſmal lump made up as it were of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed ſeed, round and rould together, appears diſhinguiſhed with the three Bubbles afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. Such as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> obſerved to come from that ſame dancing Wencb, who cauſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bortion by her violent Dancing. And I my ſelf ſaw ſuch a kind of an Abortion like a round white Ball of the bigneſs of an Hazel Nut, which came from a certain Woman who every year almoſt did ſuffer Abortion not many daies after ſhe had conceived: and I took it out of the thin coat <hi>Amnios</hi> wherein it did float, and when I pulled it aſunder, I obſerved three ſuch like Bubbles, the lower of which expreſſing a rudiment of the Liver was ſomwhat pale, but not red, alſo four portions to frame the Arms and Legs, and (which was pleaſant to behold) I ſaw two very little black points marked out for Eyes; which as in others, ſo I obſerved the ſame in a certain Gentlewoman who for two whol years together (which was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and not heard of before) did miſcarry every month, and often ſent me ſuch an Abortion that I might judg what it was, and I alwaies found them after the ſame manner.</p>
                  <p>Which things being ſo,
<note place="margin">That the ſhaping of the Child does begin preſently after the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Conception when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins.</note> it eaſily appears that the Conformation of the Child does begin at the firſt moment of Conception. Whence <hi>Macrobius</hi> in his 1. Book <hi>in ſomn. Scipionis cap.</hi> 6. writes: <hi>that Seed which after it is caſt into the Womb does not come back again in the ſpace of ſeven hours is held to be a due Conception.</hi> And a little after: <hi>that Conception which any Woman holds beyond ſeven hours is created for life.</hi> And <hi>Ludovicus Merca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de morb. Mulier. cap.</hi> 6. writes; when the ſeeds abide in the Womb, and ſeven hours after are not caſt forth, if they be conſerved and regulated by the heat of the Womb, it is to be believed that a Woman hath conceived. Hence <hi>Hippocrates</hi> tels us, that the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Conception is to reckoned from that day in which the ſeed was retained and not from the ſeventh day, when in his Book <hi>de genitura</hi> he ſaies, If a Woman be acquainted with Child-bearing, and marks when the Seed does not come away, but abide in her Womb, ſhe may know on what day ſhe conceived.</p>
                  <p>With which reaſons <hi>Tertullian (Lib. de Anima)</hi> and with him many of the Latin Fathers being moved held,

But of yong ones conceived in the Womb there is no queſtion made of their growing and encreaſing; nor of their motion from Place to Place. It remains therefore for us to hold, that the beginning of the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Soul and Body is one and the ſame. And even as the Earth if it receive a Branch pluckt from the Root, it makes thereof a Tree not contributing thereto the faculty of growing, but only the matter of the growth: ſo we ſay, that alſo which is plucks from a Man (the Seed) to ſow a Man, it alſo is after a ſort an</hi> Animal, <hi>and of an animate thing an animate thing.</hi> And moreover he ſaies, that all the faculties of the Soul are in the Seed, yet they lie hidden; whichin time and order rouze themſelves up, and ſet themſelves on work.</p>

                  <p>ANd thus we have proved that it is moſt agreeable to truth, that the Soul is propagated with the Seed: Secondly it hath been ſhewed, that the Soul whether it be propagated or infuſed is preſent at the firſt Conception, and is the Builder of its own Houſe. And they that hold the contrary, do two things principally: Firſt, they oppoſe the reaſons
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:35070:174"/>brought to prove the traduction of the Soul from Father to Son, and the propagation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by the Seed. Secondly, they endeavor to bring reaſons to prove the Contrary.</p>
                  <p>For in the firſt place, whereas it bath been ſaid,
<note place="margin">Whether, unleſs a man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the Soul in his Seed he can be ſaid to beget his like.</note> unleſs the Parent communicate the ſoul to his Child in the Seed, like ſhould not generate his like, nor ſhould a Man Generate a Man, but an irrational Creature: many have ſeveral waies endeavored to anſwer this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but in vain. For in the firſt place, whereas ſome ſay, a Man may be ſaid to beget his like, if he communicate the immediate matter fitted to receive the Soul; that is of no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For Matter does not ſuffice to conſtitute his like. And he which does not give the form of a Man, he does not beget a Man. For a Man without his form (which is his Soul) is no Man. And therefore if the Parents do not give the form of a man, they do not beget a man. Yea, and if the Father do not confer the Soul, the Child ſhould neither have Body nor Soul from the Parent according to this Opinion. For <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> 1. <hi>de gener. animal. cap.</hi> 2.20 <hi>&amp;</hi> 21. and 4. <hi>de gener. animal. cap.</hi> 4. denies that the Seed of the Father contributes any part of the matter to the Body of the Child. Which although Phyſitians deny: yet this is certain, if from the Seed any part of the Body proceeds, that is very little and only the firſt lineaments of the Body; and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If we hold that the ſoul is infuſed into the Body after it is ſhaped, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that they that are dead do generate. For ſince Generation is the union of the Soul with the Body, and according to their Opinion who hold that the Soul being created is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed by God, it may be infuſed upon the fortieth day or later, and in the mean while the Father may die: either the Father cannot be ſaid to have begot that Child, or he muſt be ſaid to have begot it after he was dead.
<note place="margin">The Birth does not confer the likeneſs of Sort, but the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, Some conceit that a Man begets his like in reſpect of the ſpecies or ſort, inaſmuch as the end of Generation is the perfect nature of Man, and inaſmuch as he is not born not comes into the Light according to the order appointed by God, ſave with a body and a rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Soul. But this Anſwer ſuffices not. For if the rational Soul comes from without, the vital conception is not perfected into a Man, but there is nothing ingendred ſave an Irrational Animal. Nor is the Queſtion concerning the birth of a Man, but his Generation; which is not performed in the birth, but in the due Conjunction of a Man and Woman according to the Ordination of God. Nor does a man only come into the world, but a Man is alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, as it is ſaid of <hi>Cain, Geneſ.</hi> 4. ver. 1. Adam <hi>knew his Wife and ſhe conceived and bare</hi> Cain. Nor is their objection more ſtrong but the ſame with this, who ſay, that if that which is generated by a man is in its time perfected into a man, a man begets his like. For if he hath not his Form and Rationality from his Parents, but from ſome other, Like is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred by its like.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Whereas ſome ſay that Axiom [Every Animal when it generates gives both the Body and Soul to its Iſſue] is to be underſtood only of thoſe ſouls which are drawn out of the power of the Matter, but the rational ſoul is not drawn out of the Matter,
<note place="margin">The Souls of Bruits are not drawn out of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the Matter. The nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of mans Soul may Iland with the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation thereof.</note> nor depends upon the Body, as to its Eſſence; that alſo is of no great moment. For it is falſly and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Reaſon preſuppoſed, that the ſouls of Bruits are drawn out of the Power of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and depend upon the matter as to their Eſſence; ſeeing by Virtue of the divine benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction they are propagated by the Parents to their yong ones. Nor does the nobility of our underſtanding both in reſpect of its Eſſence and Operations ſhew any other. For ſo it pleaſed the Creator to aſſociate a moſt noble ſubſtance to the Body. And therefore if a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional immortal ſoul can long abide in a mortal Body, Why may it not alſo be propagared with the Seed? Which if we affirm no abſurdity wil follow, as we ſhall ſhew here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, Some ſay, a man does ſo far beget his like, inaſmuch as he generates a ſenſitive Soul, yea and the inclinations of his Parents of Virtues and Vices, and which is more, Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſin alſo (they ſay) is transfuted by means of this ſenſitive ſoul from the Parents into the Children. But this is only ſaid and not proved, that there is in Man a ſenſitive Soul ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting of it ſelf beſides the rational: And if there were, yet a man by communicating the ſame ſhould not ingender his like. For the Eſſence of a man is not compleated by a ſenſitive ſoul but by a rational. But whether Original ſin in our firſt Parents did ſtick only in the ſenſitive ſoul, and not in the rational alſo, I leave to the judgment of Divines.</p>

<note place="margin">Whether God he the Cauſe of the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mans Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</note> ſince that which prevails moſt againſt thoſe who deny the ſoul to be in the ſeed is the Formation of the body of Man, and yet they wil not be content to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Truth, ſeveral men ſeek ſeveral excuſes. For ſince none can deny that ſame ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable ſtructure of our bodies, they ſeverally invent ſeveral Cauſes to which to attribute the ſame rather than to the ſoul immediately preſent in the Seed. And here ſome fly in the firſt place to God the firſt Cauſe of al things. So <hi>Alphonſus Caranza</hi> a Spaniſh Lawyer, <hi>tract. de part. natur. &amp; legit. cap.</hi> 1. when he had rejected al the Cauſes which others pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, at length he determines the firſt Cauſe of the Formation of Man to be God, and the Divine Power and Wiſdom, and for his Opinion he brings that in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 118. verſe 73. <hi>Thy Hands have made and faſhioned me.</hi> And that of <hi>Job,</hi> chap. 10. <hi>Thy Hands have faſhioned me. Haſt thou not poured me forth like Milk, and curdled me as Cheeſe? Thou haſt cloathed me with skin and fleſh, and covered me with Bones and Sinews.</hi> But in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry truth the Wiſdom and Power of God is ſufficiently ſeen in the ſhaping of our Bodies: but that is not therefore to be accounted the immediate and ſole Cauſe of our Conformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For the ſame power and wiſdom is ſeen in the Formation of Animals, yea, and of Plants too. And concerning the Lillies of the Field our Savior ſaies <hi>Matthew</hi> 6.30. That God hath cloathed them. As therefore it muſt not be thence concluded, that God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is the Cauſe of the Formation of Plants and Animals; ſo neither may we conclude that he is the immediate Cauſe of the Body of Man. For God is not the Phyſical Cauſe, but the firſt and univerſal Cauſe, not by Natural Motion, but after an eminent and unexpreſſible manner, as by his preſence he conſerves al things, cheriſhes them, and governs them in their actions. Who though at firſt he created the World and al that is therein; yet he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Nature which is the ordinary power of God, according to the Rules whereof the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of things is now perfected. That Wiſdom (truly) and infinite Power is primarily in the Creator; yet hath he given Power to Second Cauſes to perform artificial Works, which they alſo themſelves do really accompliſh (as was ſhewed before in chap. 2.) And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though it cannot be denied that God concurs in this work as the firſt and univerſal Cauſe (of which Concurrency of God as the firſt Cauſe with the ſecond I ſpake in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Chapter) yet that he is not the proper Cauſe does hereby appear, in that Errors do ſomtimes happen in the Conformation of living Bodies; which would not be if God were the immediate Cauſe of Conformation. For he never errs in his Actings. Nor could Natural Cauſes be rendred of thoſe Errors, which nevertheleſs Phyſitians do render either from the fault of the Matter, or inconveniency of the Place, or Imagination of the Mother. But the Actions of God cannot be corrupted or marred either through fault of the Matter, or Inconveniency of the Place, or Imagination of the Mother.</p>
                  <p>Others ſeek the Cauſe in the Seed it ſelf;
<note place="margin">Whether a Formative Principle be the Cauſe of ſhaping the Child in the Womb.</note> amongſt whom ſome hold there is a Formative Principle which ſhapes the Child, and that the Parents uſe the ſeed as an Inſtrument in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing their yong ones. But this Opinion hath been ſufficiently exammed before, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, unleſs by the Formative Principle they underſtand the Soul it ſelf. And to ad this one thing more, a certain late Writer conceits he may avoid al difficulties, if he holds that the Formative Power does not immediately follow the Eſſence of the Soul, but that by the Divine Benediction it was given to the ſoul to raiſe up in the ſeed a Formative Faculty, which the Seed afterwards being ſhut up in its place does faithfully retain; and that this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty does produce a ſubſtance, not by its proper vertue, but by that vertue it hath received from the Rational Soul; and that this Faculty when its work is finiſhed does remain joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Soul til the yong one be grown up, and then it puts it ſelf forth again, and infuſes into the ſeed a formative vertue like it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>But that which is wont commonly to fal out [that they who hold a falſe Opinion while they ſtrive to ſhun one abſurdity they fal into many] the ſame hath happened here.
<note place="margin">Whether any forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty can be in the ſeed without the ſoul.</note> For in the firſt place, whereas every accident requires its ſubject, and is in the ſubject by its form: I demand, By what form (if the ſeed is not animated) this faculty can be in the ſeed. Which ſince there can be none aſſigned there would be an accident without a ſubſtance and ſubject. Secondly, ſince proprieties are only in one and their own ſubject, this Formative power
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:35070:175"/>ſhould firſt be in the ſeed as one ſubject, and after it ſhould be joyned to the Soul as another ſubject. Thirdly, Whereas the Formative Faculty (as by the augmentation of the body, and the regeneration of parts loſt, and chiefly in Plants and Animals does appear) is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per power of the Soul, it can be no where ſave where the Soul is, and where it is we may firmly and demonſtratively conclude that there the Soul is. Fourthly, it is ſaid but not proved, that an accident by a vertue communicated may produce a ſubſtance. For no accident can ſo much as act, much leſs produce a ſubſtance unleſs it be directed by the Form from whence it flows, and from which it hath its power of acting, as hath been ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared before in Chap. 5. concerning the ſeparate Inſtrument. But which way ſoever they explain this formative faculty, unleſs they hold the ſoul to be in the ſeed, they involve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into inexplicable difficulties. For if they hold it to be a ſubſtance they multiply En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities in vain. And ſince al things belong thereto which are proper to the Soul, why ſhould it not be the Soul? But if it be an accident it can have no ſubject, and it wil act beyond its abilities.</p>

The words of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> may be ſeen in the place alleadged. But what the ſence of thoſe words of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſhould be, is as great a queſtion as any amongſt the Expoſitors.</p>
                  <p>For in the firſt place, Some hold that every Soul is a ſimple ſubſtance, and that therfore there does not firſt come a Vegetative, then a Senſitive, and laſtly a Rational Soul; but that one and the ſame Soul in the Conception does firſt perform the Operations of growing, then of feeling and moving, and laſtly of reaſoning. For ſince the Soul cannot exerciſe its Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties unleſs it be furniſhed with ſitting Inſtruments, and does firſt perform the moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary actions, and to Nutrition few Inſtruments are required, and that is in the firſt place moſt neceſſary, therefore that is begun in the firſt place to be practiſed; but ſince Senſe and Reaſon does require many Inſtruments, they teach that the operations thereof are exerciſed in proceſs of time, when the Organs of the Body are more perfect.</p>
                  <p>Others on the contrary do reject this Interpretation, and ſay that it is not agreeing to the words of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> while in the place alleadged he expreſly writes that the Vegetative Soul is firſt had in the Conception; and that the Senſitive Soul whereby he is an Animal is received after that, as alſo the Rational by which he is a Man, and that this only comes from without.</p>
                  <p>Since therefore the Expoſitors themſelves of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> are doubtful of his meaning, the ſureſt way is to ſet aſide Authority, as is altogether moſt fit in the ſearch of Truth, and to conſider the matter it ſelf, and mannage our buſineſs with reaſons only. Which doing we ſhal find that it is moſt ſuitable to truth to hold that there is only one Soul in Man,
<note place="margin">There is one ſoul in a Man.</note> viz. The Rational Soul, yet furniſhed with the abilities of the inferior Souls, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guifted with a Vegetative and Senſitive Faculty. And if the words of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> admit this ſence, of which I diſpute not, it is a ſence convenient enough. For (which we are to note in the firſt place) the Soul is a ſimple Eſſence, and there is one only Soul in every living thing, but furniſhed with divers faculties.
<note place="margin">Divers faculties and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons flow from one foul.</note> In every Plant there is a ſpecifick Soul; yet that hath ſundry Faculties, it nouriſhes, augments, ingenders Seed, and alſo performs the proper actions of its own kind; and the properties and actions of a Roſe are of one ſort, of Roſemary of another, of Rhubarb of another, of Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore of another, of the Eugh-tree of another. Every Animal is nouriſhed, augmented, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets its like, hath ſundry Senſes, is moved, and finally performs that which is proper to its kind; and a Bee hath one ſort of properties and actions, a Piſmire another, a Sheep ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a Crow another, an Elephant another, an Ape another: which are not indeed Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, yet as the Underſtanding is the ſpecifical propriety of a Man; ſo thoſe alſo (beſides ſenſe and motion, which are actions common to al Animals) have ſomwhat ſpecifical. And if it be not abſurd in a Plant or Animal for divers Faculties and Actions to proceed from one Soul, why ſhould it be abſurd to hold the ſame in Man?</p>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Reaſons to prove that there is but one ſoul in a Man.</note> And that we ſhould hold that there is but one Soul in every Animal from whence divers faculties and actions do proceed, and not divers ſouls, many reaſons there are that perſwade us. For in the firſt place, If there were divers ſouls in a man every man ſhould not be one Animal, but ſhould have divers operations from divers forms and acts. Whereof <hi>Julius Caeſar Scaliger, Exercit.</hi> 307. <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. hath treated largely. There is no reaſon (ſaies he) which can perſwade me that our Soul (an immaterial ſubſtance, and a certain particle as it were of God) ſhould be any waies compounded, eſpecially of two things actually contrary. For I do not think Water is ſo contrary to Fire, as that which is Rational is to that which is Irrational. The Soul which is totally in every part of the Body, how can it have at once two parts actually contrary one to another? And a little after: For a Man ſhould be ſo one as an heap of ſeveral things laid together, no true Man but a Geryon, and true Chymera or Monſter. Nor can thoſe who hold the contrary avoid the force of this Argument, by ſaying, That there is in Man only one firſt ſpecifick form, and that the reſt are generical and ſubordinate to the ſpecifical, and that the rational ſoul in Man as the chief does only perform the office of a form; but the reſt though of their own Nature they are forms, and are actually in the living Creature, yet being compared with the principal they are more like matter than acts. We may indeed grant that there may be divers forms in one Individual, of which only one is ſpecifical, and the reſt pertain to the diſpoſition of the matter; yet all thoſe forms as they belong to the matter are paſſively diſpoſed, and the ſpecifick form as the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Agent uſes them as its ſubject and primary Inſtrument; and they do not perform ſuch actions as determine and conſtitute any Individual to be of ſuch or ſuch a ſort. But the Vegetative and Senſitive Faculty (they cal it Soul) do not pertain to the diſpoſition of the matter, but are primary faculties; and according to their Opinion, the Senſitive per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms the office of a ſpecifick form, before the coming of the Rational. And therefore if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the coming of the ſenſitive ſoul the vegetative, and before the coming of the rational ſoul the ſenſitive ſhould conſtitute the ſame Individual, one numerical Individuum ſhould at divers times be informed with divers ſpecifick forms; which is abſurd: and ſo if an Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual ſhould contain divers perfect beings in it ſelf, it would be one by accident, and an heap of things.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If a man ſhould in proceſs of time receive divers ſouls, this abſurdity would follow, That there are divers living Individuals which ſhould belong to no ſort of live Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. For while a man lives only by the vegetative ſoul he muſt be a Plant, not yet ſhould he belong to any ſort of Plants; while he lives with a ſenſitive ſoul he muſt be an Animal, but yet not belonging to any ſort of Animals.
<note place="margin">There is no vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative thing but pertains to ſome ſort of vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</note> To which reaſon although ſome endeavor to anſwer; yet they alleadg nothing that is of any moment. <hi>Joh. Gallego</hi> allows the anſwer of <hi>Tolet.</hi> 2. <hi>de Anima, cap.</hi> 3. who ſaies, That ſuch an Individual is not eſſentially a Plant, and therefore is nor under any kind or ſort of Plants; but that it is contained under the kind of an <hi>Embryo,</hi> and under ſome ſort of the ſame kind; and that Nature bath made two diſtinct ſorts of Vegetations, the one of which is a Plant, and the other an Embryo or yong Conception; and that this kind of Embryo's does contain under i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſo many ſorts of Embryo's as there are of perfect Animals, and that the ſort of Humane Embryo's hath a Nature by it ſelf, which as the Inſtrument of the Generator makes an Organization conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to receive the Humane ſoul created by God. But one abſurdity being granted a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand follow, and thus one abſurdity is heaped upon another. For if this vegetative degree is common to Plants and Animals, how comes it to paſs that from that vegetative ſoul which is in the Embryo an Horſe is brought forth, and not a Roſe, or a Dog? And ſince they make ſo many ſorts of Embryo's as there are ſorts of perfect Animals, it muſt needs be that one Embryo, if it be of a different ſort from another, it muſt differ by ſome ſpecifical form. But that is of no moment which the ſame <hi>Gallego</hi> ſaies, that the vegetative form of an Embryo produced by the Womb of a Woman does not make the Organization of a Plant, nor of another Animal, but rather that of a Man; both becauſe it is directed by the ſoul of the Woman having the ſame Organization; and alſo becauſe of it ſelf it hath a natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to make ſuch an Organization. For in the firſt place, falſe it is, and not yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, That the ſoul of the woman directs that Organization, as was ſhewed before. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, whence hath it that inclination to ſuch an Organization? Certainly it cannot have it from the common and generical form, but every determination is from the ſpecifick form. And what wil it be then when it comes beyond the degree of a vegetative, to the degree of a ſenſitive Embryo? For ſince it is then neither a man nor any other Animal (for the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive faculty conſtitutes no particular ſort of Animal) what I pray you muſt it be, ſince it is conſtituted in no ſort of Animals as wanting a ſpecifick form? Therefore it muſt needs
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:35070:176"/>come to this, That the Soul which is in a perfect Child is alſo in the Embeyo, and that which finiſhes the work is the ſame which began it: viz. That the Soul of a Lyon forms it ſelf a convenient body, the Soul of an Horſe forms a body fit for it ſelf; and that in the Embryo of a Lyon there is no form diſtinct from other Animals but the Soul of a Lyon; and that the form of an Embryo (as it is deſcribed by <hi>Tolet</hi> and <hi>Gallego</hi>) is a meer fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>And except this be granted, a reaſon of the formation of an Humane Conception, of its nutrition and augmentation, and of al the operations performed therein cannot be rendred. For the formation of the child in the Womb, and of al its parts and Organs, as alſo its nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and growth, are quite different from other Animals. For no ſort is conſtituted by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers forms, either at the ſame or a different time, but by one only, which thence alſo hath its name, and is called ſpecifical. It does ſhape it ſelf ſuch a body as anſwers the Idea thereof in it ſelf, and by ſuch a body performs ſuch actions as by which it is diſtinguiſhed from other ſorts. Hence a man from his own ſpecifick form or ſoul hath ſuch a body as no other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal hath, and performs ſuch actions as no other Animal does.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If firſt the Vegetative ſoul ſhould inform the body, afterward the ſenſitive, at laſt the rational, a Man ſhould be compounded of a Plant, a Bruit, and an Animal. And this abſurdity would alſo follow, That if the ſenſitive and rational did flow from divers forms, it would be no eſſential axiom or declaration, when we ſay a man is an Animal or living thing; for the Nature of the Animal ſhould not flow from the form of Man. But if from both ſouls the ſame Attribute ſhould ſlow, a Man ſhould not be one Animal, but two; viz. An irrational Animal in reſpect, or by vertue of his ſenſitive Soul, and a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in reſpect of his rational ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Nor are the Objections made to the contrary of any weight.
<note place="margin">Whether a Man hath three Eſſences?</note> For in the firſt place they ſay, That many and divers beings cannot proceed from the ſame Form, nor can the ſame being proceed from divers and diſtinct Forms ſince the Form is the adequate Cauſe of the Eſſence. And therefore ſince the ſame ſubject is a Man, an Animal, a living thing, he cannot have theſe divers beings from one form, but from divers. And contrariwiſe, Becauſe Man, bruit Ammals, and Plants, are living things, and that diſtinct in their forms, that which is common to al of them cannot proceed from the forms by which they differ, but from that form which is equally in them al. But we deny that the vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative, ſenſitive, and rational, are three diſtinct Beings proceeding from divers forms; but they are only the powers of one and the ſame ſoul. And that which hath deceived many is this, That they hold that in ſome body there may be the vegetative ſoul alone,
<note place="margin">The Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative ſoul conſtitutes no Plant of it ſelf.</note> in another the ſenſitive, and that by it an Individual may be conſtituted. For the Vegetative ſoul conſtitutes no Plant, or other ſort of living thing, but nutrition and augmentation are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inon to al living things, and Plants differ ſpecifically one from another as wel as Animals do, and there is one form and ſpecifical ſoul of a Roſe, another of Roſemary, another of an Oalt, another of a Pear-tree, another of an Apple-tree; whence, though a Roſe, and Roſemary, and an Oak, and a Pear-tree, and an Apple-tree are nouriſhed and augmented; yet they are augmented after a different manner, and each draws a different Aliment, and produce leaves, flowers, fruits, after a different manner; ſome of them grow to a great height,
<note place="margin">Senſe and motion do conſtitute no ſort of Animals.</note> others creep by the ground, or at leaſt grow not very high. After the ſame manner ſenſe and motion does conſtitute no Animal, but al ſorts of Animals have their ſpecifick forms or ſouls, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of which ſenſe and motion are in al ſorts of Animals different, and the external ſenſes are in ſeveral ſorts different, as alſo motion; ſome creep, others fly, others walk. Howbeit, beſides ſenſe and motion they perform actions proper to their kind; a Dog is quick-ſcented and faithful; an Horſe is couragious, and after his faſhion proud; an Elephant is diſcreet in its way; of which ſee <hi>Juſtius Lipſius, Cent.</hi> 1. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 50. the Spider weaves its nets; the Bee makes Honey-combs, &amp;c. For in al living things there is a nouriſhing, growing, and generating faculty; but theſe faculties and actions do conſtitute no ſort of Plants; but in each Plant there appear yet other actions which flow from the ſpecifical form as ſuch, and by which Plants differ one from another. In al perfect Animals there is ſenſe and motion, but ſenſe and motion do conſtitute no particular ſort of Animal; but beſides ſenſe and motion there are in every ſort of Animal other powers and actions which proceed from the ſpecifick ſoul as ſuch, and whereby Animals differ one from another. Nor are the vegetative or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive, or the vegetative, ſenſitive, and rational, certain peculiar forms diſtinctly exiſting, and three Eſſences. For although they are really ſomwhat in Nature: yet they ſubſiſt not by themſelves apart, nor are they any where, or at any time ſeparately exiſting ſave in the mind, juſt as a Being, a ſubſtance, and a body; and therefore they do not multiply the Eſſence of a thing.</p>
                  <pb n="520" facs="tcp:35070:177"/>
                  <p> Secondly,
<note place="margin">From one ſoul flow all the ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>culties of the ſame ſort of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal.</note> They object, that if in a man there be not a vegetative and ſenſitive Soul, but only their faculties, then there wil be a power of a power. But this does not follow, nor does the vegerative faculty flow from the ſenſitive, nor the ſenſitive from the rational, but all the three faculties flow immediatly from one ſoul, as from the ſame form of Fire Heat and Lightneſs do proceed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly they ſay: Where there is the operation of any form there is the form it ſelf; but in Men beſides his underſtanding there are the operations propet to other ſouls, therefore there are in him other ſouls alſo. But the anſwer is the ſame we gave to the firſt argument. Nor are the vegetative or ſenſitive faculties, Powers which proceed from any peculiar and ſpecifick form. A Roſe, Violet, Willow, Oak, Dog, Lyon, Ox, are coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo many ſorts of living things, but there is no where exiſtent a vegerative faculty which does conſtitute any ſpecies by it ſelf: but the vegetative and ſenſitive (as was ſaid before) though they may be conceived and conſidered diſtinct in our minds, yet they do not any where or at any time exiſt diſtinct in nature. And what wil they anſwer concerning Bruits, of which the ſame queſtion may have place? For when an Horſe is formed, that action per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to the vegetative faculty, and is a work of the formative faculty; but that vegetative faculty is no peculiar ſoul different from the ſenſitive and the ſpecifick which Neighs (for by this mark the unknown ſpecifick form of an Horſe is commonly deſcribed) but theſe are faculties of the ſame ſoul, which in the firſt place forms the Organs of Nutrition, as being in the firſt place neceſſary, and afterwards the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, they object: Where there are operations differing in kind, there alſo are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent forms; but in a Man there are operations differing in kind, Vegetation, Senſation, Intellection: <hi>Ergo</hi> alſo ſouls differing in kind. But different operations do only argue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers forms where the ſubjects are divers. But in one ſubject different operations may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the ſame form.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly,
<note place="margin">How a Man is at once a Man, an Animal, A Vegetable.</note> they object: If the humane ſoul were a ſimple Nature not compounded of a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Eſſence and of a ſenſitive and vegetative ſoul, by the ſame very ſoul a Man ſhould be a Man, a Beaſt, a Plant; and ſeeing whatever belongs to a man that belongs to him of it ſelf and primarily by virture of his ſpecifick form, a Man ſhould be primarily and of himſelf, a Man, an Animal, a Vegetable. But a man can no waies be ſaid to be primarily and of himſelf a vegetable, or ſenſitive Creature; both becauſe vegetation is a proper paſſion of an animate body, which is the remote Genus of a man, common to every ſublunary living thing, and Senſation is the property of an Animal common even to Bruit Beaſts. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the adjunct of a kind does not of it ſelf primarily belong to a ſort of that kind. But out of our Anſwer to the firſt Argument an Anſwer may eaſily be brought to this alſo. For that which they count abſurd is not ſo, viz. that by the ſame ſoul a man ſhould be a man, and an Animal, and a Vegetable; or to ſay better, ſhould both underſtand, move, and grow. For neither is an Animal or Vegetable, any thing diſtinctly ſubſiſting in nature; but as a man by one and the ſame ſoul is a Being, and a Subſtance: ſo is be alſo a Living, Senſitive, Moving. Mean while, becauſe theſe Conceptions are different, ſome Generical, others Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifical, ſome moſt ſpecial, we may not attribute the adjuncts of a Being or Subſtance to the ſoul of Man as it is rational, and as he differs from all other animals.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly,
<note place="margin">Nothing Corruptible in the ſoul of Man.</note> they ſay: Corruptible and Incorruptible differ in kind. But the rational ſoul is incorruptible, the reſt corruptible. Therefore they cannot be in one ſubject. I grant the whol Argument. For neither is the ſoul of man compounded of a corruptible and incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, either ſubſtance or faculty: but the ſenſitive and vegetative faculty in man are as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible as the rational, ſince they flow from the ſame ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Sevently, Whereas <hi>Plato</hi> and thoſe who follow him, do therefore conceive they ought to hold divers ſouls in a man, becauſe there is a certain fight betwixt the rational part of the ſoul and that part which is ſubject to paſſions; ſince nothing fights againſt it ſelf: that by Chriſtians is eaſily Refuted, who know, that that ſame fight betwixt the divers faculties of the ſoul is not Eſſential thereunto, but came in by the ſin of our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore conſtantly retain the Opinion of moſt learned Men, which is guarded with ſtrong reaſons, and againſt which nothing ſolid can be alleadged; that the ſoul in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry living thing is only one, but furniſhed with divers faculties which in every Plant performs the acts of Nutrition, Augmentation and Generation, but in each after a peculiar manner, and moreover performs that which is proper to every Plant; whence a Roſe differs from an Oak and a Vine: and that in Animals there is ſomwhat which beſides Nutrition, Motion and Senſe, performs that which is proper to every Animal. For no Animal is perfected by
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:35070:177"/>ſenſe and motion only; but as underſtanding is proper to a Man, ſo in every Animal (beſide the moving and ſenſitive faculty) there is a proper faculty, which anſwers to ratiocination in a man, and by which one Animal differs from another.</p>
                  <p>Now the Soul does not perform all theſe operations together at the firſt Generation of an Animal, but thoſe in the firſt place which are moſt neceſſary,
<note place="margin">Why the ſoul pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently upon its Riſe does not propagate all its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</note> and therefore ſhe does in the firſt place finiſh the Organs of the ſaid moſt neceſſary actions. For not to ſpeak now of the Child in the Womb, but of the Infant when it is born; that it hath a perfect Soul is out of Queſtion; yet it does not preſently Go, it does not Speak, it does not Reaſon: but in proceſs of time it performs all theſe things; but it is preſently nouriſhed and augmented: but when the Organs neceſſary for thoſe other actions are finiſhed and perfected it performs all thoſe things. And hence alſo it happens, that although Generation pertains to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getative faculty yet it does not ſhew it ſelf before the twelfth or fourteenth year; although the operations of the ſenſitive and rational ſoul do ſooner exerciſe themſelves.</p>
                  <p>And ſuppoſe we ſhould grant that the rational ſoul hath ſomwhat peculiar: yet no cauſe can be aſſigned, why as in Plants (which cannot be denied) all actions proceed from one ſoul, they may not do ſo in all other living things, and why the ſpecifical ſoul of every Animal may not forthwith be preſent with all its faculties. Not can they alleadg at leaſt one proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reaſon whereby to prove that in a Dog, or Lyon, at firſt there is only a vegetative ſoul, and that the ſenſitive and motive faculties do come afterwards. For as it does not follow, that the moving ſoul is not in a Whelp, becauſe it does not run as ſoon as it is born, or in a Chicken or Pigeon becauſe it does not fly: ſo alſo we cannot conclude that in the ſeed there is not preſent the ſenſitive and motive ſoul, becauſe thoſe actions are not performed by the Seed.</p>
                  <p>And verily thoſe who think otherwiſe do involve themſelves into many difficulties; and whiles they build, now upon Reaſon, now on Authorities and falſe ſuppoſitions, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to reconcile Truth and Falſehood, they involve themſelves in Labyrinths and Mazes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extricable.</p>
                  <p>For in the firſt place, <hi>Aquinas</hi> grants out of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> That firſt there is only the vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative ſoul, and that afterward the ſenſitive comes, and then follows the rational. But he holds that the vegetative ſoul periſhes when the ſenſitive comes, and that the ſenſitive periſhes when the raional comes; and that becauſe (5. <hi>Phyſ. text.</hi> 38.) he finds written, that one numerical thing hath only one numerical Act, and that conſq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uently divers forms cannot be in one ſubject, and therefore he thought, when the later form comes the former muſt periſh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aquinas</hi> was in the right in judging that one thing hath but one form; and if he had held, that preſently upon the firſt original there is only one ſoul in every living thing, he might have eaſily acquitted himſelf. But while he endeavors to reconcile this true opinion with a falſe one, viz. that at different times different ſouls are produced and come into a man, he fals into abſurdities. For thus the Child in the Womb wil not remain the ſame in number, but wil be a different thing; being one kind of thing when in the firſt daies it is nouriſhed and augmented by the vegetative ſoul; afterwards another when it is governed by the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſoul; and again another when the rational ſoul comes into it. And if the ſoul or ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick form of another Animal, after it comes, is ſufficient for Nutrition, Augmentation, Senſe, Motion, and to perform that which is proper and ſpecifical to every Animal, Why may not the ſame alſo in Man preſently upon the firſt Conception be the Cauſe of Nutrition? And what great need is there to multiply Beings, ſince one ſoul is ſufficient to perform all the actions which belong to every Animal?</p>
                  <p>And the very ſhaping of our Body does ſufficiently ſhew the abſurdity of this Opinion;
<note place="margin">The Child is ſhaped only by the Soul.</note> and that formation is begun and perfected only by one ſoul there are many things which prove. For in the firſt place (as was alſo ſaid before) there is no vegetative or ſenſitive ſoul ſimply exiſting, which is not determined to ſome certain ſpecies. In Plants indeed there is a vegetative ſoul, and in the Conceptions of Animals.
<note place="margin">As the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getative is in Plants and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals after a different manner, ſo is the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive in Animals.</note> But the Vegetative in Plants is ſo ordered by Nature that it draws nouriſhment out of the Earth and faſtens it to the Plant: contrariwiſe the vegetative of Animals draws it not out of the Earth, but in the Womb from the Mother, and after the Child is born out of its Veins. In like manner the ſenſitive facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is in a Dog, in an Ox, in a Man. But in an Ox it delights in Hay, not in a Dog, not in a Man. Mean while, ſince according to theſe mens opinions there are the operations of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getative and ſenſitive ſoul in the Child in the Womb before the rational ſoul be preſent, there ſhould then be operations which ſhould proceed from no ſoul. For there could not be in the Child in the Womb the ſoul of any imaginable Plant, not of any Animal that can be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
                  <pb n="522" facs="tcp:35070:178"/>
                  <p> Secondly, Since preſently after Conception Conformation begins, that ſhould be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Vegetative Soul which is firſt preſent. But ſince that according to the Opinion of <hi>Aquinas</hi> it is ſoon extinguiſhed, and its conformative faculty is withal aboliſhed (for a faculty cannot paſs out of one foul into another) and nevertheleſs Conformation is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it muſt needs be that the ſenſitive muſt finiſh the ſame, and when that alſo is aboliſhed the rational. But it is abſurd, that one numerical Conformation ſhould be made by three powers of diſtinct ſorts, or (as they ſay) ſpecifically different, or the faculties of three ſouls ſpecifically diſtinct. And how wil they explain the Conformation of Bruits in which (according to their Opinion) there is no ſuch ſucceſſion not introduction of divers Souls? And therefore as in bruit Animals by the ſame faculty the yong one is nouriſhed, the tenth day, the twentieth, the thirtieth, and al the months of Geſtation, or while it is in the Mothers Womb, yea, and al the reſt of its life; and al thoſe acts or nutrition do make up one numerical entrition continued from the beginning to the end of the Creatures liſe: ſo alſo no cauſe can be given, for which the Child alſo in a Womans Womb ſhould not be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed the tenth, twentieth, thirtieth day, al the months of its being in the womb, yea, and al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ts life time by one Soul.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If the ſoul which is firſt introduced is the cauſe of the Conformation of the parts for the introduction of the following ſoul it ſhould act beyond its forces. For the vegetative ſoul hath not the ability to form parts neceſſary for the following ſoul being ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; nor hath the ſenſitive ſoul (I ſpeak according to their imagination of three diſtinct ſouls) power to form parts neceſſary for the rational ſoul. 'Tis therefore better to hold with <hi>Themiſtius</hi> that each ſoul is the builder of her own houſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Alphonſus a Caranza</hi> when he ſaw that he could not hold divers ſouls in one Man, he ſought another ſtarting-hole, and <hi>de part. nat. et legit. cap.</hi> 1. <hi>parag.</hi> 2. <hi>de anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione,</hi> holds a twofold Animation, anſwering to the double formation of a Man, the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and the perfect; and he teaches, That in the firſt time of that ruder formation the child lives with the life of Plants,
<note place="margin">Whether Plants do truly live?</note> and in the ſecond time with a perfect life, or with a ſenſitive and rational Soul at once. Now he teaches that by the life of a Plant we are to underſtand a certain vital and nutritive faculty, but not a true life which is not in Plants; ſince Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers in this manner of ſpeaking do not underſtand a true life, nor do ſpeak properly, but improperly and by way of ſimilitude. Foraſmuch as there is only one ſoul in man, and one life, and that there is no concourſe of ſouls, following one after another in the ſame ſubject, but one ſoul which is infuſed after the utmoſt perfection of the body. And he writes, That <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> being moved by this reaſon wrote in 7. <hi>Politic. c.</hi> 16. That to avoid over-abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Children (according to the Gentiles Cuſtom) it is lawful to endeavor Abortion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it be done preſently after the Conception, when the Child lives the life of a Plant; but that after the coming of the rational Soul it is wickedneſs to do it.</p>
                  <p>But in good deed, theſe things are thus ſaid without al reaſon, and do contain many falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. For in the firſt place, it is falſe that the Plants do not truly live. For though others do otherwiſe define life, yet which way ſoever it be defined it properly belongs to Plants as their operations do teſtifie. And where there is life there is a Soul, and there is no life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Soul. Since therefore he acknowledges vital Operations in that former and rude for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation (and it cannot alſo indeed be denied) he muſt needs acknowledg the ſoul to have been long ſince preſent; or let him ſhew us that ſubject to which thoſe faculties belong which perform thoſe Operations of nouriſhing, augmenting, and forming. And therefore ſecondly, if the rational Soul is not infuſed (as he holds) before the perfect Formation of the body, I deſire him to ſhew us what it is which forms the body til the thirtieth or fortieth day.</p>

The firſt is; That cannot be without a body, the action of whoſe Principles is corporeal, for examples ſake to walk without Feet: but the mind alone comes from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, becauſe the corporeal action communicates nothing therewith. But let us indeed grant that the ſoul ſeparated from the body does communicate no more with the body and bodily actions, and uſes no bodily Organ:
<note place="margin">Whether the human ſoul parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate with bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly actions</note> yet that the ſoul when it is in the body hath nothing to do with bodily actions, ſubſiſts by it ſelf, and therefore is in the generation of a Man created, is falſe. For the Queſtion is not now concerning the Soul, which hereafter (being ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the body) ſhal perſiſt by it ſelf through the ſingular pleaſure of God, as ſhal here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be ſaid; but concerning the work of Generation our Queſtion is, and concerning the Humane Soul as it ſhapes and informs the body. That this Soul in this life hath no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the body cannot be granted. Indeed if the Rational Soul in Man were a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar ſoul diſtinct from the vegetative and ſenſitive, this reaſon would have ſome probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But ſince there is only one Soul in a Man, having a vegetative, ſenſitive, and rational Faculty, as was proved in the foregoing Chapter, and the Soul of a Man does not only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and reaſon, but alſo informs the body (not of an Hart, or a Lyon, but a Man) nouriſhes it, augments it, conſerves it, and makes it enjoy ſenſe and motion, and that not after the manner of Bruits, but of Men; it is moſt manifeſt that it cannot want corporeal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, and that when it informs the body, and performs theſe Organical actions, it communicates ſimply with the body. And although in reſpect of the rational Faculty ſome of its actions are inorganical, as when it underſtands the intelligible ſpecies without a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and when it refects upon it ſelf, and knows that it underſtands that it is able to know it underſtands, alſo when it wills; and indeed the mind does not underſtand by the body as the means and Organ wherewith; yet becauſe while it is in the body it needs a Phantaſm for its object, and as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf (3. <hi>de Anima, text.</hi> 39.) ſpeaks, the Intellect needs to contemplate the Phantaſms; and nothing is in the Underſtanding which was not in the Senſe: certainly the Underſtanding muſt needs communicate with the Phancy. Which is ſufficiently declared by ſundry ſorts of mad men, in whom Ratiocination alſo it ſelf is hurt, by reaſon of the ſociety it hath with the diſpoſition of the body and bodily Inſtruments; as alſo the variety of Wits, whiles ſome are excellent for ſharpneſs of wit, and others are bloc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh, proceeds from the ſame cauſe. All which things being ſo, and though the Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding do not uſe the body to underſtand withal: yet ſince it is neceſſary that it ſhould ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Phantaſms, there is no cauſe why we ſhould ſo abſolve the Underſtanding from communicating with the body as long as it is therein. Much leſs is there any cauſe why at laſt when the body is perfectly ſhaped it ſhould come in from without.</p>
                  <p>But eſpecially al that have followed this Opinion have been deceived by that falſe Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis, touching the Education of Forms and Souls out of the power of the matter.
<note place="margin">The ſouls of Bruits are not drawn out of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the matter.</note> For ſince they beleeved the ſouls of Bruits were drawn out of the power of the matter; they would not aſcribe ſo ignoble an original to the Humane Soul, and therefore they argue; The Rational Soul is not drawn out of the power of the matter, <hi>ergo</hi> it is created. Or, Whatſoever is not made of a pre-ſuppoſed matter or ſubject, that is created; but the Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſoul is not made of another matter or ſubject, <hi>ergo</hi> it is created. That is the falſe Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis (I ſay) which they build upon, That ſome ſouls are drawn out of the power of the matter. If (truly) thoſe ſouls of bruit Animals and Plants did ſpring out of the power of the matter, it were not abſurd to aſcribe a more noble beginning to the Soul of Man; but ſince that Hypotheſis is falſe, and no ſouls of any kind are (to ſpeak properly) drawn out of the power of the matter; but ſouls were put into al living things, and received from the Divine Benediction a power to multiply and propagate themſelves, nor are they made of the ſeed as of matter, but are propagated with and in the ſeed: if the ſame original be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:35070:179"/>to the Humane Soul, no abſurdity wil follow: if namely we ſhal hold, That being in the firſt Creation made by the moſt good and great God, and implanted in the body of Man, by vertue of that Command <hi>Encreaſe and multiply</hi> it hath received a faculty to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate and multiply it ſelf in and by the Seed. Not is the Rational Soul an Eſſence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat by it ſelf, as the Angels are, which ſubſiſts alone by it ſelf; but it is the one half of a Man which informs the Humane Body, and therefore as its ſociety with the Body derogates nothing from its nobility and immortality, no more does the propagation thereof with the Seed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">Whether if the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſoul be propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated from the Father to the Son, it ſhould be therfore mortal.</note> Many have been moved to hold that the Humane Soul comes from Heaven and from without into the body, becauſe they conceit that if it were propagated with the ſeed, it muſt needs be mortal. And in good deed (to ſpeak ingenuouſly) this is a very promiſing Argument, and by many variouſly urged and aggravated. For ſince the ſeed is ſundry waies ſhed ſo that no Conception follows (as when a man ſpils it out of wantonneſs; in the Gonorrhea; when a man couples with a woman with child, or with a barren woman, and indeed many waies the ſeed is often ſo ſhed that no formation follows) they conceit it ſhould come to paſs that ſo often the ſoul of Man (which is otherwiſe counted immortal) ſhould periſh, and man-ſlaughter ſhould be committed. And therefore by this Argument which they count invincible and unanſwerable, being moved, many have held the infuſion of ſouls; and ſeeing they did acknowledg it neceſſary that the formation of the child ſhould begin preſently after the firſt Conception, and yet they durſt not attribute the ſame to the Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Soul, ſome invented one, others another cauſe of formation, and attributed the ſame to a formative Faculty, or to the Womb, or abſurdly to a certain ſenſitive ſoul preſent before the rational, the vanity whereof hath been ſhewed before. But the ſtrength of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not ſo great as is imagined. For as <hi>Scaliger</hi> rightly teaches, <hi>Exercitat.</hi> 61. <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. and <hi>Exercit.</hi> 307. <hi>Sect.</hi> 20. God alone is truly immortal and incorruptible, becauſe he only hath his being from himſelf, and depends on none; but in reſpect to God al created things are mortal and corruptible, which at the pleaſure of the Creator may be depoſed from that being wherein they are conſtituted. Yet ſome of them are not corrupted, as Angels and the rational Soul, becauſe the Creator wil not have them corrupted, and hath made nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to them whereby they might be corrupted, nor hath ſo plunged them in matter as that they cannot ſubſiſt nor operate without the ſame: and ſo they are immortal not by Nature, but by Grace and ſpecial favor, as <hi>Damaſcen</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>de Orthodoxa fide, cap.</hi> 3. And queſtionleſs (as was ſaid in the anſwer to the foregoing argument) there is great difference betwixt Angels and Men. They have never had any thing to do with matter, nor ſhal have. But the Humane Soul (while it is in the body) does neceſſarily uſe corporeal organs, and therefore it is not propagated without matter. And therefore that is falſe which they ſay, if the Humane Soul exiſt after death by it ſelf without matter, therefore it is alſo produced without and free from matter. For as it pleaſed God that the Humane Soul ſhould not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt without the body, but ſhould naturally have its ſubſiſtence in an Humane body; ſo it is alſo his pleaſure that it ſhould be propagated in and with the ſeed. In a word: the manner of Generation makes nothing to the corruptibility or incorruptibility of an Eſſence, but that depends ſimply upon the will of the Creator who made al things of nothing when they did not exiſt, and by his power preſerves them ſo long and after ſuch manner as he pleaſes from ſliding back into nothing again. Without which Divine pleaſure and peculiar Grace to Man-kind, the forms of men ſhould have periſhed as wel as thoſe of Bruits. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no conſequence, if the Humane Soul whoſe natural habitation by the will of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is an humane body, being ſeparated therefrom by death can ſubſiſt by the Divine plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, therefore of neceſſity it did ſubſiſt out of the body before it was aſſociated thereto. And whereas they who aſſert the Creation and infuſion of the ſoul do hold that God makes Humane Souls immediately without ſeed: it is impious to ſay that God could not alſo make them immortal by means of the ſeed. And to thoſe other things that are brought to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate this argument, touching the effuſion of ſeed without any conception following: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That the Divine benediction, and thoſe gifts of Grace which God by his free pleaſure and ordination hath granted to the ſeed and ſoul of both Parents joyned together in Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt by no means be attributed to the ſeed of one Parent alone, not ſhed after ſuch a manner as is neceſſary to Generation. Yea, and ſince neither in other Animals the ſeed of one Parent hath ſuch perfection that one alone is ſufficient to make a Conception, and thoſe attributes which are rightly attributed to the ſeeds joyned may not be attributed to the ſeed of either by it ſelf; that is much more true in Man.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, they object that the ſeed is an excrement of the third digeſtion,
<note place="margin">Whether the Seed be an Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and therefore not ſo noble as to be capable of the rational ſoul; but that only a perfect Body and furniſhed with al its Inſtruments is apt to receive the rational ſoul. Of this Argument we have ſpoken in the Chapter foregoing, and in Chap. 6. and 7. where I have demonſtrated that the ſeed is not an Inſtrument properly ſo called, nor that any unprofitable thing is generated in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; yet in that ſence it may be called an excrement inaſmuch as it is voided forth of the Body. Otherwiſe and of its own nature it is the moſt noble ſubſtance of the whol Body, and an Epitomy (as it were) and fruit of the whol Man, as hath been ſaid. Much leſs is it an excrement of the third concoction: but is bred of venous and arterial Blood, and vital ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in their veſſels, that it may be a ſit receptacle to receive the ſoul. And there in all ſorts of Animals it is capable of the ſoul. And if the rational ſoul may be received by a Body formed of the Seed and menſtrual Blood, Why may it not alſo be received in the ſeed?</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe three Reaſons, ſome do uſe divers general Arguments againſt the preſence of the ſoul in the ſeed propounded before, eſpecially in Chap. 7. as alſo the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> &amp; 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, which it is needleſs here to repeat, ſince they concern not the ſeed and ſoul of Man in particular, but the ſeeds and ſouls alſo of Plants and Animals; and <hi>Fienus</hi> himſelf confeſſor they are but weak, and alſo anſwers them, <hi>de format foet. quaeſt</hi> 5. But becauſe he adds two which he counts more ſtrong, I muſt not let them paſs. The firſt (and ſo the fourth objection which alſo we propounded before Chap. 9.) is this: Neither the Blood nor the Spirits are animated, <hi>Ergo,</hi> conſequently not the Seed. He proves the Conſequence, becauſe the former are produced in parts much more noble than the Stones, viz. the Heart, Brain, Livet; which if they could not beſtow a ſoul upon the Blood and Spirits, neither can the Stones do it. But it is there alſo anſwered, that the ſeed is the fruit of a living body, and far more noble and excellent than the Blood and Spirit.</p>
                  <p>His ſecond Argument and ſo the fifth objection is: if in the ſeed of a Man there were a ſoul it ſhould be either Rational, Senſitive, or Vegetative. But it can be none of cheſe. That it cannot be Rational is proved, Firſt, Becauſe if it were rational, the ſeed of a Man being in his Teſticles or Paraſtate ſhould be a Man. Secondly, The ſpilling of a Mans Seed upon the ground ſhould be Man-ſlaughter. Thirdly, The Seed caſt upon the ground muſt be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, leſt the ſoul ſhould be damned eternally. Fourthly, if the ſeed were animted with a rational ſoul, the ſeed of a Woman ſhould be no leſs animated than the ſeed of a Man: and if the ſeed of a Woman were animated ſhe might engender by her ſelf. Fiftly, if the rational ſoul were in the ſeed, either it ſhould be the ſoul of the Parents extended in the ſeed, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided and multiplied according to the diviſion of the ſeed, or it ſhould be ſome ſoul bred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new and produced in the feed or infuſed by God. But al theſe things he counts to be abſurd. Firſt he conceives that the ſoul of the Parents cannot be multiplied, becauſe then it would follow, that the rational ſoul is diviſible and conſequently mortal, and that all Men have one ſoul, and that our ſoul ſhould be a particle of our Fathers ſoul; and the ſoul of our Father a particle of the ſoul of our Grandſire; and at laſt al our ſouls ſhal be particles of the firſt man, and ſo communicated by Generation. Al which things he counts to be falſe &amp; different from the Catholick Religion. Alſo he ſaies the ſoul cannot be produced afreſh from the ſoul of the Father, for ſo it ſhould be drawn out of the power of the matter and become moreal: nor that it is infuſed by God, and Created in the Teſticles; becauſe there it could neves come to a perfect ſtate, &amp;c. Nor does he conceive the Soul to be in the ſeed, becauſe ſince a Man hath two Teſticles and a Woman hath alſo two, if in Copulation animated ſeed ſhould fal from four Teſticles, four ſouls ſhould be united, or one ſhould be coagulated of four glewed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Secondly, Becauſe then the ſeed of Animals ſhould be a Plant; and a Man before
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:35070:180"/>he ſhould arrive to a rational ſoul ought to paſs through the form of a Plant, and afterward through the Form of a Bruit, and be once an Aſs or a Dog. Thirdly, Becauſe that Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Soul ſhould be produced by a Rational ſoul exiſtent in the Teſticles, which cannot be, becauſe the Rational Soul cannot have the power to produce a Vegetative Soul, ſince thoſe ſouls are ſpecies diſtinct one from another. And many other abſurdities he objects in caſe we ſhal ſay that the Vegetative Soul is in the Seed, which for brevities ſake I omit.</p>
                  <p>But I wonder that ſo renowned a man, and who in the beginning of the foreſaid Book writes, that no man had found out the efficient cauſe of ſhaping a man in the Womb, or if ſome few had ſmelt it our, they had neither cleerly opened nor by any reaſons maintained the ſame, but that he would prove his opinion with ſuch firm and evident reaſons, that no man ſhould afterwards have occaſion to doubt, ſhould uſe ſuch frivolous and light reaſons in ſo ſerious a matter. For firſt of all intending to write accurately of the Efficient cauſe of the Childs formation, he ought to have remembred that a Phyſitian muſt borrow many things of the natural Philoſopher, that he may attain to the knowledg of the Subject he is to work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but becauſe he doth not equal Cauſes with their Effects, nor adjuncts with their proper ſubjects, viz. ſuch to which they belong primarily and of themſelves, and inaſmuch as they are ſuch, his diſcourſe breeds no true knowledg, as <hi>Jacobus Zabarella Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Method. cap.</hi> 11. teaches. For ſince it is not Man alone that is formed in the Womb, but alſo other Animals which bring forth live yong ones; moreover Animals are hatched out of Eggs, Plants are formed out of their Seeds: he ought to have enquired in general of the Generation of all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals, yea of all living things, and what Cauſe did ſhape both Plants and all Animals; and the Cauſe being found, to conſider whether it belong to a Man alſo, or whether we are to hold a peculiar Cauſe of the Conformation in a Man, and to render a Reaſon why that power which forms other Animals hath not place in a Man, but that another ought to be ſought out. Again, he ought to demonſtrate and not barely ſuppoſe it as a thing granted, that there are three ſorts of ſouls in a man, and not one furniſhed with divers Faculties. Thirdly, he ought alſo to have noted this, that not the Seed of the Man or Woman alone does ſuffice to produce the Child, nor is the ſeed cal'd a Conception whiles it is in the Teſticles, but when both Seeds are joyned in the Womb, which things being obſerved he might eaſily have anſwered all his own Reaſons. For in the firſt place, he might eaſily have marked that the Seed of a Man whiles it is in the Teſticles does not ſuffice to Generation, and that therefore when it is ſhed upon the ground it needs not be Baptized, nor does the Womans Seed alone ſuffice for Generation. And whereas he conceits that it is falſe, abſurd, and different from the Catholick Religion, that the Soul ſhould be propagated from the Father to the Son; indeed it is not agreeable to the Doctrines of the Schoolmen, but it is nevertheleſs moſt true and agrees with the holy Scriptures. For how ſhal that Precept <hi>Encreaſe and Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply</hi> be fulfilled, unleſs from the firſt Man and Animals at firſt Created all the Men and Animals that do live and have ever lived unto this day had received their Souls? And in <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 46.26. it is ſaid that Sixty ſix Souls came out of the Thigh of <hi>Jacob;</hi> and <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.4. that the Souls that came out of the Thigh of <hi>Jacob</hi> were Seventy, which I nevertheleſs do leave to the conſideration of Divines. Nor does it hence follow that al men have one Soul or that the Soul is mortal. The firſt Man had one Soul from whence al came. Nor is there any reaſon that the Soul of Man if it be multiplied ſhould be mortal: for the Creator commanded that it ſhould be multiplied, and nevertheleſs it was his pleaſure it ſhould be immortal. Which things being granted, al the reſt fals to the ground, ſo that there is no need of an Anſwer. Alſo it wil appear from what ſhal be ſaid againſt the ſixth and ſeventh Objection, what is to be anſwered to the reſt; and that though the Soul be communicated from the Father and Mother, that yet it is not compounded.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly,
<note place="margin">With what Soul the Seed is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated.</note> Some late Writers do thus argue; Either the Seed is ammated by the Soul of the Parent, or by its own proper Soul. Not by that of the Parent: for then the Soul of the Parent ſhould become the Soul of the Son; and ſhould go out of the Parents Body with the Seed. Nor with its own Soul; becauſe ſince both Parents contribute Seed, the Son ſhould then have a double Soul, or one ſhould grow to the other and it ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>
                  <p>But if this Argument were objected againſt the Generation of Plants and brute Animals, that which a man ſhould then Anſwer may here alſo ſerve for an Anſwer. Moreover, I ſay in general that both in Plants, Bruits, and Mankind, the Seed is animated with the Soul of the Parent, viz. according to the ſort; for otherwiſe like would not beget its like. Alſo
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:35070:180"/>true it is, that the Seed hath its own Soul, and that numerically different from the Soul of the Parent. Yet thence it does not follow, that after this manner the Soul paſſes out of the Patents Body with the Parents Seed. For the Soul of the Parent remains perfect and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, although it multiplies it ſelf. And as it does not follow, when in augmentation and in the ſhooting forth of the new Boughs on a Tree the Soul diffuſes it ſelf into the new matter and cloaths it ſelf therewith, that it goes out of the former Body: ſo it does not follow when it communicates it ſelf to the Sed, that it goes out of the Generator. For this is the force of the Divine Benediction, that the ſame Soul remaining perfect and entire ſhould be able to multiply it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>el<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. And whereas it is ſaid that the Soul of the Son ſhould be double, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, this may eaſily be anſwered by thoſe who hold, that the Seed of the Father or the Mother only is prolifical. Not do they want an Anſwer, who ſay that the Seed of both the Parents is prolifical; and before <hi>cap.</hi> 9. we have anſwered thereto, viz. how that the Souls being of the ſame fort when they are joyned together do not make a compound; and it hath been ſaid before Chap. 9. out of <hi>Scaligers Exercit.</hi> 106. <hi>ſect.</hi> 6. that of three ſtems of a Palm joyning together one Palm-tree is made, and a flame made of ten Torches or Links is called but one flame, and not a compounded flame. And if it be commonly ſaid without ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity that the ſoul is totally in the whol body, and totally many part; why ſhould it be abſurd to hold that the ſoul is totally in the Mans feed, and totally in the Womans? And moreover, as the whol ſoul is ſaid to be in the Eye, the Bram, the Heart, nor does it therefore follow that one ſoul is compounded of many ſouls; but this continues ſtil a truth, That it is one Soul which informs the whol and al its parts: ſo although it be ſaid that the leed both of the Man and Woman is ammated, it does not therefore follow that one ſoul is compounded of two ſouls, or one made up of two.</p>
                  <p>Another forms the ſame Objection after this manner: if the Soul of a man be propagated,
<note place="margin">The ſoul of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration remains entire.</note> it is done either by cutting off ſome part of the ſoul of the Parents, or by the inſtrumental efficiency of the ſeed, or the ſoul of the child is immediately produced from the ſoul of the Parents, ſo that the ſeed ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> no hand in the production of the ſoul, but only cauſes the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, or at moſt is the Vehiculum of the ſoul by which it is carried from the ſoul of the Parents into the Child.</p>
                  <p>But al theſe Objections ariſe from ignorance, becauſe they know not the nature of the ſoul, nor how that ſaying is to be underſtood, that every form and ſoul does multiply it ſelf, and how that Divine Benediction, <hi>Encreaſe and multiply,</hi> hath hitherto been effected, and is ſtil effected: but if they did diligently conſider, and in the firſt place ſearch out how ſouls are multiplied in Plants and Animals, alſo the manner how the ſame is done in Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, if (I ſay) they underſtood theſe things as far as they may be known in this darkneſs of our Minds, they would not invent ſo many abſurdities.
<note place="margin">The Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the Soul what it is.</note> For the laſt (if rightly explained) is true, viz. That the ſeed (underſtand the body of the ſeed) is the Vehiculum or carriage, by which the Soul is communicated from the Parents to their iſſue: which action is called traduction or delivering over, the word being borrowed from Plants. For as in Trees in which the ſeminal faculty is diſfuſed through their whol bodies, if any part be cut off, and grafted upon another Tree, the ſoul of that Tree from whence the branch was taken is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the Tree upon which it is ingrafted: ſo with the Seed the ſoul of Animals is tranſplanted into the womb of the Female, and ſo from that ſeed endued with its ſoul a perfect Animal does ſpring up. But as, when a branch is cut from the Tree with its Soul in it, that Tree neither loſes its ſoul, nor does that ſoul become leſs: even ſo when the ſoul of the Parent in the ſeed is delivered over unto the iſſue, the ſoul of the Parent remains intire. And as when in augmentation the ſoul is communicated to the aliment flowing in, the ſoul which is in the reſt of the body does not become leſſer; and as when from a root or ſtem of a Vine, or the root of an Hop, many and long branches grow up in one Summer, all which receive their ſouls from the root and ſtem, and yet the ſoul is totally in the yong branches, and totally remains in the old ſtock or root, not being made leſſer: ſo alſo the ſoul of the Parent is tranſplanted with the ſeed into the child, it ſelf nevertheleſs remaining entire. And this multiplication of ſouls preſents an image of the immenſe and infinite God, who (as <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caeſar Scaliger</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>reigns every where without place, al without al things, and the whol without parts.</hi> I ſaid an Image. For God the Beginning of al things is an infinite fulneſs, filling al things, whom neither the Heavens nor Earth do contain, totally exiſting within the World, totally without, and yet reſtrained within no limits. But our ſoul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is joyned together by dimenſions, and its fulneſs is only ſo large as the body is, and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily dimenſions: yet though we ſhould ſuppoſe a body to grow from the ſmalleſt quantity
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:35070:181"/>to the greateſt bulk, the ſame ſoul would fil it al remaining the ſame without any Addition. Alſo in like manner, though an Animal generate often, and the ſoul multiplies it ſelf, and communicates it ſelf to the iſſue, it is not diminiſhed of any of its parts as having none. Of which we have ſpoke more largely before, Chap. 9. Which things it were better attently to conſider, than to oppoſe the truth though far out of ſight.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, Neither are thoſe things of any great moment which <hi>Aphonſus Caranza</hi> here objects, and whereby he would prove, That the Rational Soul is infuſed at the laſt when the body is perfected. For in the firſt place, as to that place in <hi>Exodus,</hi> 21. which he cites out of the Septuagint, and proves afterwards from <hi>Philo, Lib. de ſpectal. leg.</hi> viz.

And let us ſuppoſe there was ſuch a difference of penalties, and let the Civil Laws and Lawyers here quoted by <hi>Caranza</hi> retain their Authority: yet thence it no waies follows that the Seed is not animated preſently upon the Conception. The Law-givers perhaps, and the Lawyers had their Cauſes known at home, into which I ſhal not now enquire, and which I leave to their place, why they would otherwiſe puniſh him who deſtroys a Conception per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſhaped, than they would do him that deſtroys one leſs perfect; and this perhaps a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt was not the leaſt, that before the Child begins to be moved there is no ſuch great certainty of its life, and many things might happen to it in the Womb, although no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal cauſe was added, which might take away its life before it came to ful perfection; ſo that what <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaies of the Child born in the eighth month, <hi>it is not, and it is,</hi> that may much rather be ſaid of ſuch an imperfect Conception; and therefore they would inflict a greater puniſhment upon him who ſhould deſtroy a perfect Child, and upon him a leſs that deſtroyed an imperfect one of leſs hope, and ſubject to more caſualties.

No man (certainly) wil ſay that a Child is not quick at the end of the fourth month, and at the middle of the time her wixt the Conception and the Birth, ſince al men count the fortieth day the longeſt term in the ſpace whereof the child receives the Soul.

Sanctacruz,</hi> That he who kils an animated Conception, however ſmal or imperfectly organized, wanting yet ſenſe and motion, is a murderer no leſs than if it were perfect; but it does not thence follow that al homicide ought to be puniſhed alike; ſince though both are alike perfect eſſentially, yet are they not alike accidentally perfect. Would not (adds he) any man think that a greater injury was done him by him who had hewn him down a very tall and fruitful Pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, than by him that ſhould pluck out of the Earth and break a ſmal branch only, a foot high, newly planted, and that therefore he is worthy of greater correction, and more ſtripes.</p>
                  <p>Nor is that argument which he brings in the Second place, of any great moment; whereby he concludes, Becauſe God made <hi>Adam</hi> of the ſlime of the Earth, and when he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and faſhioned, breathed into his face the breath of Life; that therefore in Generation alſo the Rational Soul is not infuſed before the formation of the body. But Creation and Generation are of a different Nature. The Woman was created of the Rib of the Man, yet is ſhe not ſo generated.</p>
                  <p>But in the third place, I admire that a Chriſtian ſhould endeavor to prove by that action of <hi>Hippocrates, de Nat. pueri,</hi> That the Rational Soul is not in the Child the firſt daies. For inaſmuch as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> adviſed the Dancing Wench with child, that within the ſixth
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:35070:181"/>day ſhe might caſt out the ſeed by dancing, he conceives that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> thought that the ſeed retained ſo long in the Womb had not the rational ſoul in it; for otherwiſe he would not have perſwaded her to cauſe Abortion. Moreover he brings for the ſame the Authority of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who <hi>Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>polit. cap.</hi> 16. allows the deſtruction of a child in the Womb as long as it is not furniſhed with ſenſe and life, as if he did ſuppoſe that the Conception was without life ſome notable ſpace of time. But <hi>Johannes Baptiſta Sylvaticus,</hi> becauſe of this very place, does conceive (and that not without cauſe) that the Book was not written by <hi>Hippocrates, Controverſ.</hi> 32. and if it were written by him, yet this Counſel of his is by no means to be allowed, but is to be reckoned amongſt the fooliſh Imaginations and Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinations of the Pagans, of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks <hi>Romans</hi> 1.21. And the like reckoning we are to make of that ſame deſtroying of Conceptions uſed by the Heathen, of which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>politic. cap.</hi> 16. And therefore alſo that Decrea of the Canon Law, in <hi>Decreto in cap. ſicut ex Literarum, de Homicidio,</hi> where a Monk by whoſe aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance a woman had procured her ſelf Abortion, is not counted irregular, and is allowed to ſay Divine Service, becauſe the Child (as was thought) did not live, is by <hi>Franciſcus Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinus,</hi> a moſt learned Phyſitian, in his Commentary on <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his Oath, rightly ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med unjuſt, and that diſtinction faulty.</p>
                  <p>If yet any further Objections may be made againſt our Opinion, their Refutation is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently apparent from what hath been ſaid. The ſum whereof comprehended in the words of a certain great Divine, is this: An whol Man according to the Primitive Ordination of God begets an whol Man. An whol Man Ical a Male and Female, who are made into one fleſh, or become one fleſh, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.6. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.31. Now the Parents generate inaſmuch as they are men, that is, according to that which belongs to the whol ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies or ſort of Mans Nature, in vertue of that Divine Word, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.28. <hi>God bleſſed them, and ſaid, bring forth fruit, and multiply and repleniſh the Earth.</hi> And they generate by the conjugal conjunction. Nor does the male ingender alone, nor the ſemale ingender alone, not the Body only, nor the Soul only, but the whol Man, viz. Male and Female coupled according to the Ordination of God, And therefore a Son or a Daughter proceeds not from the Father alone, or from the Mother alone; but the Son and the Daughter is from the whol Father, and the whol Mother, and equally the Son and Daughter of the one as of the other; and as the Generation of the Patents is common, ſo the work of Child-making or Filiation, is common to both as to Nature.</p>

                  <head>THE CONCLUSION.</head>
                  <p>AND thus I conceive I have delivered the true Opinion concerning the Generation of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving things, and the propagation of Souls by the ſeed from the Parents to the Iſſue, both in Plants and Animals, yea, and in Man himſelf; and eſtabliſhed the ſame by firm rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and refuted the Objections of thoſe that are contrary minded. In the mean while by the admonition of <hi>Scaliger, Exercit.</hi> 297. I ſee, obſerve, and remember, how weak the ſight of our mind is, to ſearch into the ſecret Cloſets of Nature; and I hear al learned men in a manner (eſpecially in the Queſtion of the Original of the Humane Soul) complain of the obſcurity and difficulty thereof. And therefore I alſo (peradventure) may be deceived and err. Yet this I conceive I have demonſtrated by a moſt firm reaſon from the Act to the Power, and from the Power to the Act, or Form and Soul, that there is the Soul in the ſeed both of Plants, and of Animals, and of Man himſelf (whether it be propagated by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, or ſent in by God) as ſoon as ever the formation of the living body begins. And this Tenet I ſhal ſo long maintain til it ſhal be to me demonſtrated how without the ſouls pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence this work of the formation of a living body can be performed. Which unleſs it can be done it wil be the part of a mind ſtudious of the Truth not to labor how to oppoſe that moſt firm demonſtration by certain Objections, and ſo to render it ſuſpected, but rat her to be careful how to anſwer his own doubts. For <hi>Julius Caeſar Scaliger,</hi> in <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> writes from <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> where the thing it ſelf is apparent, and Opinion oppoſes the thing, we muſt ſeek a Reaſon, but not be ignorant of the thing. Now that thing is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:35070:182"/>which is demonſtrated by moſt firm Reaſons. And here at laſt I ſolemnly proteſt that I acknowledg and confeſs the Excellency and Eminency of the Humane Soul, and its diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence from the Souls of Bruits; that it alone bears the Image of God, is ſeparable from the Body, and immortal. And therefore, if I have ſaid any thing (as I hope I have not) which may really oppoſe this Prerogative of the Soul, I wiſh it were unſaid. But whether the propagation thereof from the Father to the Son, do that, and whether therefore it muſt neceſſarily be held to be immediately infuſed into our Bodies by God; I leave that to the Judgment of every Man. What ſeems to me moſt probable I have freely declared.</p>

<note place="margin">The gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Live things how manifold.</note> becauſe <hi>like</hi> evidently Generates its like, is commonly termed univocal Generation, there is yet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, which becauſe there in <hi>like</hi> is not thought to generate its like, it is called vulgarly Spontaneous and equivocal. So, of Horſ-Dung thoſe flies are Generated which we cal Beetles, of Corne a certain Worm called in ſome places a Wibble, of Beans another ſort of Worms, of Wood another, of the foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Skin and Garments Lice and Fleas, as alſo out of Cheeſe and Fleſh and other putrefying things Worms and Inſects commonly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, of ſundry ſorts do ariſe, as ſhal afterward particularly appear, The conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the Generation of which kind of Living Things is neceſſary and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy the Cogniſance of a Natural Philoſopher; which very thing <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> did hint, when 1 <hi>de Part. Animal. Cap.</hi> 5. he thus wrote: <hi>With a certain Childiſh ſcornful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to deſpiſe the diſputation and Conſideration which may be had concerning the meaneſt Animals, and to count it tedious, is no way beſeeming a Philoſopher; ſince there is nothing in Nature in which there is not ſomwhat to be admired.</hi> And as it is reported <hi>that</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclitus <hi>ſaid to thoſe that came to ſpeakwith him, and becauſe they happened to find him ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by chance in a Bakers Cottage to Warm him at the Oven, they would not go to him, as abaſhed at his bomly manner of ſitting in ſuch a place: for he bid them enter boldly, ſince even this place</hi> (quoth he) <hi>is not void of the preſence of the immortal Gods: the very ſame may be ſaid touching the Inquiſition into the Nature of Animals. For we ought to contemplate and diſcuſs all things without ſhame; ſince in all things the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Nature and her Honorable and Beautiful contrivance is conſpicuous.</hi> And that ſo much the more diligently, inaſmuch as ſew have written any thing that is ſolid and agreeable to truth, concerning this ſubject. Above all others the moſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned <hi>Fortunius Licetus</hi> Profeſſor at <hi>Padua</hi> hath written moſt diligently and larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of this Matter, in his 4. <hi>Books of the Spontaneous Origmal of Live Things.</hi> As for me, though I acknowledg the difficulty of the matter, and am well aware that it is dangerous to hold any thing different from the vulgar opinions, and liable to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, eſpecially in this ſubject: yet I had rather freely ſhew my judgment in an obſcure matter and contribute mine aſſiſtance, then to ceaſe from the inveſtigation of truth Let every one follow what Opinion he pleaſes. I obtrude mine upon no man. And if any man will ſhewe me better, I ſhall willingly aſſent unto him.</p>
                  <p>Now this Generation, as hath been ſaid,

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:35070:183"/>from moral actions to Natural.

And the ſame <hi>Scaliger</hi> concerves <hi>Exercitat.</hi> 140. that it cannot be accurately or properly ſaid, that a Tree grows <hi>Sponte</hi> of its own accord. But the word ſeems to be more general, and to be oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to that which is againſt ones will, or to that which is not done ſave by an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Agent, and contrary to Natural Inclination. And therefore, as it is attributed to other actions which are performed by an internal Agent, no external Cauſe concurring, ſo alſo it is attributed to Natural Generation. Whence <hi>Virgil.</hi>

                        <hi>Whether</hi> Avicenna <hi>held that Men could grow out of the Earth.</hi>
                     </note> This Opinion is alſo by ſome attributed to <hi>Avicenna.</hi> But it is not credible that <hi>Avicenna</hi> ſo great a Philoſopher ſhould follow ſo Fahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous an opinion. <hi>Avicen</hi> indeed writes <hi>Lib.</hi> 15. <hi>de Animalib. Cap.</hi> 1. <hi>As men might cut themſelves off from Generation, either by their own free will, or by Peſtilential Air and ſo come all to die, and then if a man ſhould be made he would Generate, and ſo the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:35070:183"/>kind would be renewed: and making and engendring would mutually aſſiſt one the other, in preſerving the kind.</hi> But the ſence of thoſe words is this: if all Men ſhould periſh, either voluntarily, forbearing to Generate, or Slain by Peſtilence, if after the Death of all Men a new man ſhould be made, which way ſoever, whether by Gods Creation or any other means; he being a new man cannot be thought to want the power of engendring other Men like himſelf, by which the kind might be maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning the original and efficient Cauſe of ſuch living Things,
<note place="margin">The effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Cauſe of Living things Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated of themſelves</note> Authors do very much diſſent. <hi>Cardanus Lib.</hi> 9. <hi>de Subtil.</hi> ſaies that ſuch things as are ſaid to be Generated of their own accord are Generated by Fortune and Chance. But therein he is out. For Chance and Fortune have no hand in Natural things, and whatſoever things are made by Chance and Fortuitouſly, they are not alwaies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred of the ſame principles and after the ſame manner. But things which grow up of their own accord are alwaies bred of the ſame Principles, and after the ſame manner, and have certain efficient Cauſes, which alſo act for a certain ends ſake, and produce certain effects. So, of Horſ-Dung Beetles are bred, and not Eare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wigs; out of Cheeſe Mites, and other kind of Worms out of fleſh, and in general, alwaies things determinate breed of ſuch and ſuch things; Yea, and they are born at a certain Seaſon too; and the kinds of flies, Ear-wigs, Worms, Beetles and But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Flies do all ſpring and periſh at their certain Seaſons. And although as <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danus</hi> Objects, in ſundry places on the Earth, in the Waters, in dead Carkaſſes and elſwhere, we ſee the ſame things bred: yet they are Generated of a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate matter, which may be found in divers places frequently. And although it may happen, that the matter which is fit for the Spontaneous original of things may in ſome places be collected by Chance: yet that matter is determined, nor are living things made thereof by Chance, but the next efficient is determined, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies acts after the ſame manner. Nor matters it that ſuch things as ariſe Sponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly are leſs perfect (an Argument whereof they take to be their not Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting) and therefore cannot have the notion of an end, and ſo ſeem to be made by chance. For though compared to others they are ſomwhat imperfect: yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their own eſſence they are perfect, are Nouriſhed, Augmented, Moved, and perform operations beſitting their ſpecies. But that conceit of theirs is falſe, when as they imagine ſuch things do not Generate; ſince even the very leaſt and moſt ignoble of theſe kind of Creatures do couple and Generate, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches every where, and eſpecially in his 5. <hi>de Hiſtor. Animal:</hi> and Experience alſo it ſelf doth teſtifie as much. And although in compariſon of other Creatures they ſeem ignoble, yet are they neceſſary for the perfection of the whole Univerſe, as ſhall be ſaid anon from the <hi>Exercitation</hi> 250. of <hi>Jul. Caeſar Scaliger:</hi> and that <hi>Avicenna</hi> wrote well when he ſaid it was better Lice ſhould be bred, then that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid matter ſhould remain in that condition, is the Opinion of Learned men, who acknowledge a rare piece of workmanſhip even in the ſtructure of a Louſe. For if in the firſt place we conſider the prime Work-Maſter of all things, he that he might diſcover his infinite Wiſdom and Omnipotency, had rather that living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſhould be multiplied in the world, then corrupt and putrified matter void of Life; and it is his pleaſure, that the bodies of more perfect living Creatures, when they are corrupted ſhould not turn ſimply to putrid matter, but into more ignoble Aniruals. Hence, from the parts and Excrements of Animals, from Plants and their fruits ſundry ſorts of living Things do proceed, and from ſuch and ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate Things ſuch and ſuch determinate Creatures ariſe and no other. So thought and wrote <hi>Jul. Caeſar Scaliger,</hi> who <hi>in the forecited place</hi> thus writes: Man was made for God, the world for Man. And ſoon after: Man is the Prince of Animals. Now man ſhould not have been Prince, if he had not been made as he is, <hi>viz.</hi> in the middle. Nor could he be in the middle, unleſs betwixt extreams. They were therefore made for the Mediums ſake. Now if any of the extreams, or of thoſe things which are ſeated betwixt the middle and the extreams, were wanting, there would be a vacuum amongſt the forms. Which would be a greater fault in Nature, then a <hi>Vacuum</hi> in Quantity without a Body. For what is more abſurd then a middle without Extreams? which <hi>Auſtin</hi> alſo taught long ago, <hi>de Civitate Dei Lib.</hi> 12. <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. It were Ridiculous (ſaith he) to imagine that the faults of Cattle and Trees, and other Mutable and Mortal things, which want either underſtanding
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:35070:184"/>or Senſe or Life, ſhould be damnable: ſince thoſe Creatures have received that manner by the appointment of God, that by giving way and ſucceeding they might accompliſh the loweſt pulchritude of times, in their kind, agreeing to thoſe parts of the World. And a little after: the comlineſs of which order therefore doth not delight us, becauſe we according to this our mortal condition being Woven in as a part thereof, we are not able to diſcerne the whole, to which thoſe particles which offend us do very aptly and decently agree. <hi>And again:</hi> Nature conſidered in it ſelf and not with reference to our commodity or diſcommodity, gives Glory to its Work-Maſter.</p>
                  <p>Others though they do not hold that ſuch things are bred by Chance or Fortune;
<note place="margin">Whether things ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated of them are produced only by the common Cauſe.</note> yet they conceive they have no other immediate Cauſe efficient, but only the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and remote one, in which opinion is the <hi>Conciliato,</hi> who <hi>Differ.</hi> 29. doth make this difference betwixt other Living Creatures and thoſe which breed of themſelves, becauſe the former beſides the Univerſal agent, <hi>viz.</hi> The Heaven, do alſo require a particular one, ſince the Sun and Man Generates a Man; But the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter want an immediate Cauſe, and are produced without a particular agent. And the Name it ſelf ſeems to ſay as much. For ſince they are ſaid to ariſe of their own accord, that ſeems to hint that they have no external immediate efficient Cauſe diſtinct from themſelves: for elſe they would not be ſaid to be Generated of themſelves. But in very truth, there ought alwaies to be a proportion betwixt Cauſes and Effects, that Univerſal Effects may have Univerſal Cauſes, and Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Effects Particular Cauſes, and General General, and Special Special. And if it were not ſo, no demonſtration could be made; which is not made by the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Cauſe, and ſo no demonſtration nor ſcience can be had of ſuch thing as are generated of themſelves. Moreover, the common and remote Cauſes are all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and manifeſt. But that ſuch things as grow of themſelves do ariſe from an internal Cauſe lying hid in the matter, we ſhall ſhew anon ſufficiently. Moreover, ſince there is a great variety of things which breed of themſelves, and differences, and certain ſorts, they verily cannot all proceed a like from one common Cauſe, but to every ſort its next ſpecial Cauſes muſt be aſſigned. And that thoſe common Cauſes do not ſuffice doth hereby alſo appear, that which way ſo ever they turn themſelves who defend this Opinion, they cannot diſintangle themſelves. Whence they are divided into ſundry Opinions concerning that remote Cauſe</p>
                  <p>

But the anſwer is the ſame which was given to the other Opinion. For ſince God created all things very good, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo furniſhed them al with neceſſary forces, and conſequently here is no defect, no weakneſs, which need to be ſupplied either from Heaven, or by the extraordinary aſſiſtance of God.</p>
                  <p>Others therefore take pains indeed to find out this immediate cauſe, but all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily, whiles they ſeek the ſame out of the matter, and not in the matter, and define Equivocal Generation to be that in which the efficient out of matter which came not from nor out of it ſelf, but is of a quite different Nature, generates a thing ſpecifically unlike it ſelf and its own form. But none of them hath been able with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Abſurdity to ſay or ſhew what that efficient is, and how it could Generate a thing ſpecifically unlike it ſelf, and its own form.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Avicenna</hi> held that an Intelligence Subordinate to God,
<note place="margin">Whether the form of theſe Creatures is made by Intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> whom he calls <hi>Colco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> doth produce the Souls of theſe things. But it is not yet proved, that there are ſuch Intelligences from which things Natural proceed. For from God alone as the firſt cauſe of all things, and Nature, all Natural things proceed. Nor is Creation to be attributed to any other thing but God Omnipotent. But the immediate effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Cauſe of Generation ought to be like, either in ſort, or in the next kind, to that which is Generated. And therefore theſe Spontaneous live Things cannot ariſe from a Cauſe of a quite different kind from themſelves, ſince they are Natural Bodies.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">Whether they are generated by the Heaven.</note> Others hold the immediate efficient Cauſe of theſe Bodies to be the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. But this Opinion will not hold Water, more then the other. For in the firſt place, the Heaven is the common cauſe of all things Sublunary, as Subſervient to their Generation: and therefore it cannot be ſaid to be only the immediate cauſe of theſe Spontaneous Creatures, for the Heaven after its faſhion advances the Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe kind of Creatures, and of ſuch as engender one another, all a like; nor can any Reaſon be aſſigned, why it ſhould rather advance the Generation of Spontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things then of others. For if they will run to Heaven for want of an immediate Cauſe, we ſhal declare ſufficiently hereafter, that it is not wanting neither, in the Generation of theſe Spontaneous Creatures. Moreover, although they that hold the Heaven to be the Cauſe of this Generation do ſundry waies endeavor to declare the ſame: yet none of them do ſufficiently explain the matter: For ſome, as <hi>Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes,</hi> do hold that the heat of Heaven is the efficient Cauſe of theſe Creatures: or that theſe Creatures are produced by the Heaven, by help of its heat. Others (as <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi>) do hold that the light of Heaven is the immediate Cauſe of the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:35070:185"/>Original of things; others, the motion of Heaven, as <hi>Thomas Aquinas;</hi>

<note place="margin">Whether the Heaven be alſo a Particular Cauſe.</note> But every effect requires an immediate Cauſe, and a ſpecial effect a ſpecial Cauſe. Moreover, Heat, Light, Motion, and occult Influences are acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. But no ſubſtance, ſuch as the Souls of theſe creatures are, can be produced by an accident. Some indeed do hold, that Heaven is not only an univerſal Cauſe, inaſmuch as it affects all Sublunary things, but alſo a Particular, in as much as by a Peculiar Virtue it concurs mediately or immediately to the generation of all things. But neither is the knot thus looſed. Indeed I grant, that after its faſhion the Heaven doth alſo particularly concur to the making of all things Sublunary, and that not one face of Heaven nor poſture of the Stars, and influence thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, and ſeaſons thereon depending, but ſundry, are neceſſary for ſeveral Plants, when they grow, when their flowers ripen, when their fruit comes forth; and that ſome things ſpring at certain poſitions of the Heaven, and die away at other poſitions, and that doubtleſs there is a Peculiar Sympathy betwixt ſome certain ſorts of things and ſome Stars. But the queſtion is whether the heaven gives the forms which conſtitute thoſe ſpecies: which we deny, and hold that the Heaven by its influx doth only ſtir up ſome firſt qualities in the Air, and alſo by an occult influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence excite the forms of living Things, and cauſe them to buckle themſelves to their proper operations. And ſo, as the Heaven in Univocal Generation ſo called, while the Sun and a Man do generate a Man, is not the next and immediate, but the remote and mediate cauſe: ſo alſo, in this Spontaneous original, it is not the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate and next, but the remote and mediate cauſe. Which in Plants and Eggs is hereby manifeſt, in that even the heat alſo raiſed from Elementary Fire doth often perform as much. So the heat of a Stove can in the Winter cauſe, that forms which lie hid in Seeds will begin to rouze themſelves up and ſprout. After the very ſame manner Fleſh alſo in the Winter time kept in an hot place wil pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifie and breed Worms, as wel as in Summer. And as the Dugs of Virgins whiles by their heat they hatch the Silk-Worms Eggs do not give a form to the Silk-Worms, nor the heat of the fornace doth not give to Eggs the form of Chicken: even ſo the Heaven doth not either by its heat or hidden influx give the form to theſe Spontaneous Creatures; but as it cannot ingender a Man without a mans help, ſo, unleſs there lie hid in the matter a ſeminal principle it can engender nothing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from. For the Heaven indeed may hold its courſe without inferior cauſes: but in the things themſelves below it alone can ingender nothing without the concourſe of inferior cauſes, they being in every Generation the immediate and principal agents.</p>

But in good deed, we have elſwhere ſhewed, that there is no Soul of the World. For though in Animals
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:35070:185"/>ſundry actions proceed from one Soul: yet it is not proved, that the world is after ſuch a manner one as an Animal is one. And if the world indeed had a Soul, it ſhould be only an univerſal cauſe, not an immediate, nor could any Reaſon be given why Spontaneous things ſhould rather proceed therefrom then non-ſpontaneous: and of neceſſity a cauſe muſt be which in Spontaneous things ſhould determine the ſame to this action, as there are ſpecifical cauſes in the Generation of other living Things. Nor was it therefore to be conſtituted, that it might ſupply the defect of a next Cauſe, in things of Spontaneous original. For we ſhall hereafter ſhew that ſuch a cauſe is not wanting in the Generation of thoſe things. And how can ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſorts of things Spontaneouſly generated proceed from one Soul?</p>
                  <p>The Opinion of <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> differs not much from the foreſaid opinion,
<note place="margin">Whether from the Soul of the Earth.</note> who attribute that which the Platoniſts aſcribe to the Soul of the World, unto the Soul of the Earth and Water, or of the Terrene Globe eſpecially. For ſo <hi>Cicero,</hi> 2. <hi>de Natura Deorum</hi> writes: And if ſo be thoſe things which are contained in Plants of the Earth do live and grow by the Art of Nature, verily the Earth it ſelf is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and held in by the ſame force and Art of Nature: foraſmuch as ſhe being ful of the Seeds of things, engenders al things, and pours plants out of her ſelf, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces, nouriſhes and encreaſes them: and the her ſelf likewiſe is nouriſhed by the upper and extream Natures. And <hi>Seneca,</hi> 6. <hi>Quaeſt. Natural Cap.</hi> 16. 'Tis evident ſaith he, that the Earth hath a Soul. I do not mean that Soul only whereby ſhe holds her ſelf, and joyns her parts together, which is even in Stones and Dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: but I mean a vital vigorous Soul which nouriſhes all things. If She had not this Soul, how ſhould ſhe infuſe Spirit into ſo many Trees which have their life from nothing elſe, and into ſo many Herbs? How ſhould ſhe be able to foſter ſo many Roots, ſo different, in ſo various manners buried in het, ſome creeping in her ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, others growing deep downwards, unleſs ſhe had plenty of Spirit, which gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates ſo many and vatious things, and affords nouriſhment to the ſame? And <hi>Marſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Ficinus, Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Immortal. Animae Cap.</hi> 1. We know for a certain (ſaith he) where nutrition and augmentation follows Generation, there is Life and Soul. But we ſee the Earth by her own Seeds Generate, nouriſh and cauſe to grow innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Trees and living Creatures. Alſo ſhe cauſe Stones to grow, as it were her Teeth, and Herbs as it were her hairs, as long as they ſtick faſt by their Roots, which if they be plucked up and rooted out of the Earth they do not grow. Who will ſay, the Womb of this Mother is void of Life, which of its own accord brings forth and nouriſhes ſo many Children; which ſuſtains its ſelf, whoſe back brings forth Teeth and Hairs? The ſame may be ſaid of the Body of the Water. The Water therefore and the Earth hath a Soul, unleſs perhaps ſome man will ſay, that thoſe living Creatures which we (becauſe they ſeem to have no Seeds of their own) ſay are generated by the Soul of the Earth, are not bred of the ſaid Soul, but from the influences of Heavenly Spirits.</p>
                  <p>But as this Opinion differs not much from the former, ſo after the ſame manner it is eaſily refuted. It is truly manifeſt that much Air and Spirit is contained in the Bowels of the Earth. But that the ſaid Air and Spirit is the Soul of the Earth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proved. Nor are thoſe Spontaneous living Things we ſpeak of Generated only in the Earth and Water, but alſo in Animals and Plants, as ſundry ſorts of Worms. And if in the Earth there were ſuch a Soul, ſhe would not be leſs noble then her effects, but would alſo be nouriſhed, grow, and exerciſe Senſes. Alſo no neceſſity forced them to ſuppoſe ſuch a Soul in the Earth. For it is moſt known that all other living Things have their Seed from whence they are Generated: and we ſhall hereafter ſhew that Spontaneous things are not without their immediate cauſe neither. And if there were indeed ſuch a Soul, ſince it would be but one, it could not produce ſo many different ſorts of Creatures, but of a determinate ſpecifical Effect a determinate Cauſe is requiſite. And though the Earth as a common Store-Houſe doth afford nouriſhment to Plants and certain Animals: Yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not, that ſhe gives them their Souls. The Plants are firſt conſtituted by their Souls, before they draw nouriſhment out of the Earth. Nor doth the Earth of Her own ſubſtance afford nouriſhment to Plants, but only as a Store-Houſe, in which are many mixt Bodies, which prove nouriſhment for Plants.</p>

                  <p>But theſe things are ſaid, not proved, nor do they make appear that the Heaven lives, and that ſuch a vital Spirit is ſent from the Heaven into theſe lower Bodies. And if this ſame ſpirit be the immediate Cauſe, what needs a determinate matter? Which being neceſſary, we ſhould therein rather ſeek the Cauſe of Spontaneous living Things. But the Heaven can be only a common Cauſe, as it is in thoſe things which are generated of Seed: and becauſe it hath only one uniform faculty, it is no more diſpoſed to breed a Flie, then a Waſp, or Flea, and therefore it cannot be the proper cauſe whereof we treat in this place.</p>
                  <p>Others therefore,

Which by this only Reaſon may be proved, in that the whole Nature of putrefaction conſiſts herein, that it is the corruption of a mixt Body, conſider'd as ſuch. And if any thing elſe proceed from putrefaction, it is by accident. Moreover, experience ſhews that many Plants and other things are generated of their own accord without putrefaction. And of worms ſundry flying infects are bred without putrefaction. And in <hi>Cyprus</hi> in the Braſs Fornaces <hi>Pyrauſtae</hi> or Fire-flies are bred without putrefaction.

                  <p>Others ſeeing that putrefaction could not be the Cauſe of theſe Creatures held that concoction was the Cauſe.

Vivent. Ortu.</hi>) another cauſe muſt be ſought after. For the right finding whereof, we muſt firſt enquire what is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt the Generation of living things which breed of their own accord and of ſuch as ariſe from Seed, and what living Things are properly ſaid to be Spontaneous. And we muſt know in General, that thoſe things are ſand to be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated Spontaneouſly, which are generated without any evident and manifeſt cauſe. So <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in the 1 Book of Aphoriſmes, Aphoriſme 2. calls thoſe fluxes of the Belly and vomiting Spontaneous, which happen without the uſe of Medicaments, and <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Aphoriſ.</hi> 5. he calls thoſe wearineſſes Spontaneous, which proceed not from motions and exerciſes, but from ſome hidden fault of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors. So alſo Plants which grow without the care and labor of the Husbandman are cal'd Spontaneous. Of which <hi>Virgil</hi> in his 2 Book of his Husbandry.

                  <p>And Animals which ſpring from Copulation of their Patents are not cal'd Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous; but ſuch as are generated without the help of Parents are cal'd Spontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Thus <hi>Pliny Lib.</hi> 9. <hi>Cap.</hi> 51. writes of Frogs: <hi>'Tis wonderful bow after ſix months life they turn to ſlime, no man diſcerning; and again in the Spring they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated after the ſame ſecret manner, and this happens every year. Alſo Limpins and Scallops do breed of their own accord in ſandy places.</hi> But yet from the premiſes it is not ſufficiently apparent, what thoſe living Things are which be ſaid to ſpring of their own accord. For although many plants grow without the Care and Labor of Men: yet they do not all grow without Seed; ſince many ſow themſelves, and caſt their Seeds into the Earth, or Propagate themſelves by Roots. We are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now to enquire the difference betwixt things that are generated of their own accord and ſuch as are not.</p>

                     <hi>Fortunius Licetus, Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Spont. Vivent. Ortu, Cap.</hi> 2. holds, that the Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous Original of living Things proceeds from an Occult Principle which lies hid in the matter wherein the Generation is to be made,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunius Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetus.</note> and therefore from a principle internal to the thing generated, though Latent. But the Spontaneous original of things is not thus ſufficiently differenced from the non-Spontaneous; ſince alſo in the non-Spontaneous original of living-Things the hidden principle of the thing to be generated lies lutking in the matter or Seed. For the principle of generation is equally hidden to the ſenſe, in an head of Garlick, an Onion, or a Corn of Wheat, as in Horſ-Dung, whence the beetle ariſes. This rather ought, I conceive, to be
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:35070:187"/>accounted the difference:
<note place="margin">The true difference.</note> that ſuch things as are not Spontaneouſly generated do proceed from a Seed, or Bulb, or ſome other thing anſwering to Seed, manifeſtly produced by a plant of the ſame kind: but ſuch living things as Spring of their own accord are produced without a manifeſt generator of the ſame ſort. Truly when generation it ſelf is made, or rather the formation of an organical Body, the generation of a Spontaneous living Thing differs not from that of a non-Spontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. For in both the motion and the formation of the Body is made by an agent, which lies concealed in the matter. But herein they differ, in that, before the parts begin to be formed, the Soul in its eſſence, and as ſuch, and as it performs the office of a Soul, is in the Seed or matter in the non-Spontaneous generation: but in Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous generation, although the Soul be in ſome ſort in the matter of which the living thing is made; yet the Body of a Carkaſs, or what ever other matter, doth not participate the ſame under the notion of a Soul; becauſe a Carkaſs is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly animated, nor yet under the notion of an efficient cauſe, becauſe as yet it is dul and Stirs not.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit,
<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of Spontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous living Things.</note> in this thing, there is ſtil no ſmall difference. For ſome things are really engendred of matter ſpecifically different; as the Beetle of Horſ-dung, worms of Cheeſe or fleſh; but ſome things ſeem only to the ſenſe to be generated without ſeed, and of a thing ſpecifically different, when as indeed they are made of ſeed, or of ſomwhat anſwering to Seed: as ſome Plants are ſaid to grow of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, after Rains or Inundations of Water, when as in truth they are made of Seeds mingled with Rains or Waters. So of Swines dung, Carduus, and Sow-Thiſtle and other Plants do grow, not as Beetles do out of Horſ-Dung, or Worms out of Cheeſe, but becauſe ſome of the Seed of theſe plants unchanged by digeſtion are voided afterwards with the Dung.

Text</hi> 13. and <hi>Text</hi> 18. he therefore rejects the Platonical Ideas, becauſe all things both Natural and artificial have like univocal cauſes by which they are produced.</p>
                  <p>Although therefore it is to be granted,
<note place="margin">How ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous living Things are generated by an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerator.</note> that even the Spontaneous Generation of living Creatures is after a fort univocal; Yet I ſhall not deny that Generation is an Analogical kind; and that Univocal Generation is more evident in non-Spontaneous, then in Spontaneous living things. Which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf ſeems to hint, who in the place but now alleadge, 7 <hi>Metaphſ. Text</hi> 30. ſaies that all things are made after a ſort by an Univocal agent. And indeed the Nature of the Generation of Plants which proceed from Seed properly ſo called, (ſuch as that is of non-Spontaneous live Things, as alſo of thoſe things which ariſe from a latentſeed) is different from that of thoſe live things which are moſt properly ſaid to ariſe Spontaneouſly and Equivocally. For in the former, the Seed of which they are Generated, <hi>viz.</hi> Herbs, hath actually a Soul in it already: but in theſe latter, the matter of which the living thing is Generated hath not actually in it the Soul of the thing generated; ſuppoſe a worm. Yet the form lying hid in the matter is apt to be turned into a Soul, ſo as to communicate it ſelf to the matter, in notion of a Soul, and thereout to frame a living Body. Whence that difference betwixt <hi>Seneca, Scaliger,</hi> and <hi>Licetus,</hi> concerning the Seed, may eaſily be compounded. For
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:35070:187"/>
                     <hi>Seneca</hi> 3. <hi>de Beneficiis Ch.</hi> 29. and <hi>Scaliger</hi> in <hi>Theophraſt. de Plantis Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Ch.</hi> 5. teach that al things have their Seeds. But <hi>Licetus, de Spont. Vivent. Ortu, Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. denies that al things have their Seeds, and holds that ſome things are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated by no Seed properly ſo called, though they have ſomwhat anſwering to ſeed by way of proportion. For an anſwer may be made out of the very words of <hi>Licetus; viz.</hi> Seed is taken properly, and improperly.
<note place="margin">Seed taken properly &amp; improperly</note> Seed properly ſo called is a Body, which as the proper ſubject contains in it ſelf a Soul, in the firſt formal act; which comes to paſs in ſuch things as are not generated of their own accord: but improperly that may be called a Seed, or at leaſt ſomwhat anſwering to a Seed, which hath not indeed a Soul actually, yet containes a principle or form, which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a fit diſpoſition of matter begins to exerciſe the Office of a Soul. Whence, the Carkaſſes of Plants and Animals out of which Worms are Generated do not contain in them the Seed of Worms, yet they have in them a form, which doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward advance it ſelf into a Soul. Mean while this alſo is true, that ſuch things are not altogether Equivocally Generated as is vulgarly imagined: which appears even hereby, that thoſe living things which are thought to be generated of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and Equivocally, are of the ſame ſort with thoſe which are not ſo Generated: which thing is manfeſt from Generation it ſelf. For although ſome things Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly bred do not generate, as Toad-ſtools, and Vine-Worms, and other vile creepers: yet moſt of them engender a living Thing like themſelves, as Experience teſtifies. <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> writes 1. <hi>de Cauſ. Plant. Ch.</hi> 1. and 5. and <hi>Scaliger</hi> upon him, that a Plant Sprung of its own accord hath by its Seed produced another like it ſelf. So <hi>Laſerpitium</hi> which grew up naturally of its own accord, and a whole Wood of Trees, where never were any before, did produce Plants that bare Seed. Bees bred out of a Bul are fruitful. And <hi>Avicen,</hi> 15. <hi>de Animal. Cap.</hi> 1. doth teſtifie, that he had a friend who made Scorpions, either by burying the Juyce of Baſil, or by ſome other means, and they afterward generated other Scorpions. And that in a certain City of the <hi>Saracens,</hi> called <hi>Scealikam,</hi> after a great Rain, Silk-Worms were ſeen to cover the ground many miles together, and every Worm made Silk, and afterwards they flew away and made Seed.</p>
                  <p>Now that the univocal Agent by which Spontaneous living Things are bred is a Soul of the ſame ſort with that whereby they are conſtituted in their being,
<note place="margin">The effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of ſpontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous live Things it the Soul.</note> and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſied, <hi>Fortunius Licetus teaches Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Spont. Vivent. Ortu, Cap.</hi> 26. For fince, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> both in other places and in 1 <hi>Magn. Moral. Cap.</hi> 10 teaches, Plants and Animals ariſe from Seed as an univocal principle, but the Seed is not univocal to the Animal or Plant to be generated, ſave as it participates a Soul of the ſame ſort; it ſeems from thence apparent, that the Univocal efficient from whence Animals have their original which are Spontaneouſly generated, is a Soul of the ſame Nature with that wherewith they are enlivened. And queſtionleſs the caſe is plain. For ſince it is moſt Natural and proper to the Soul to generate live things; nothing can Naturally procreate living Things which hath not a Soul in it.</p>
                  <p>Now that the Soul of theſe living Creatures is in the matter, and that we are not to ſeek their efficient Cauſe out of their matter, the Generation of Worms out of Fleſh doth ſhew, in which no external Cauſe helping, unleſs the heat of the Ambient Air, Worms break out of the Fleſh of their own accord.</p>
                  <p>Now whence this Soul which is the efficient Cauſe of theſe Spontaneous Animals doth come into the matter, of which they ariſe, is further to be enquired into.
<note place="margin">Whence the ſoul comes which Cauſes Spontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation?</note> And although this be a very difficult point, and one of the obſcureſt in Nature, and it is alſo hazardous for a man to propound his opinion herein: yet will I freely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound my mind, which if it ſhall not pleaſe all men, yet ſuch as are ſtudious of the truth will acknowledg thus much, that it comes nearer the truth then that Opinion of the Eduction of forms out of the power of the matter, which is an Opinion that paies a man with words, but hath nothing in it to ſatisfie a ſtudious mind, as is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently declared in the 4. <hi>Chap. of the foregoing Diſcourſe.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Spontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous live Things grow only out of Things living.</note> And firſt of all we muſt hold (which I conceive to be out of queſtion) that nothing can contribute ſuch a matter nor conſequently the Soul, unleſs it be a Living thing, or proceed from a living Thing; and that therefore Spontaneous living Things do only proceed from living Things or ſuch as have lived: which alſo experience teaches. For it was never yet known, that of the ſimple Elements, of Metals, Minerals, Jewels, as ſuch,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:35070:188"/>any Animal or living Thing hath been bred, but every thing of which ſuch Animals are Generated is either a living Body, hath lived, or hath proceeded from a living Body.</p>
                  <p>Now to find out the manner of this generation,
<note place="margin">
                        <p>How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waies the Soul may be in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? A twofold Act of the ſoul.</p>
                        <p>Eſſential Accidental</p>
                        <p>A double operation of the ſoul.</p>
                     </note> in the firſt place we muſt enquire, how many waies the Soul may be in a thing. For in the firſt place, which no man denies, there is a twofold act of the Soul: one Eſſential, called the firſt Act, and is the bare Eſſence of the Soul: the other accidental, which is called the Second, and is the operation proceeding from the Soul. And therefore the participation of the Soul is alſo twofold, the firſt is the Participation of the ſimple ſubſtance of the Soul, as of a form perfecting its matter; the Second is the Participation of the Soul operating. The Second participation is when Organs are provided for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the actions; to the firſt there needs only a diſpoſition of the matter, that the Soul may thereby be fit to perform the Office of an Efficient Cauſe and to form the Body.</p>
                  <p>But beſides theſe two manners, there is yet a Third, and the Soul may yet after another manner be in ſome kind of matter,
<note place="margin">A ſoul may be in a matter &amp; not inform it.</note> ſo as neither to inform the ſame and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vifie it, nor to perform the proper operations of ſuch a living Thing. So the Seeds of Plants and Animals may be in the Water and in the Earth, and the Soul may be in them, and yet they neither inform nor Viviſie the Water nor the Earth. Hence <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid, not without reaſon, 3. <hi>de Gen. Animal. Cap.</hi> 11. that all things are ful of Souls, while he thus writes: <hi>Now Animals and Plants are bred in the Earth and Water, becauſe there is moiſture in the Earth, Spirit in the Water, Animal Heat in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe, ſo that all things are in ſome ſortful of Souls. And therefore they come ſpeedily to a Conſiſtence, when that heat is comprehended or received.</hi> Which very thing manifeſtly appears from things putrid, out of which ſundry kinds of Worms are every where bred, and in Plants which grow in Common Fields and Gardens where no Seed hath been caſt. And ſcarce any place is ſo barren but that Plants and Animals will breed therein of their own accord.
<note place="margin">How all things are ful of ſouls.</note> Now this ſpeech of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is thus to be underſtood, not that all things do live and are animated; for which cauſe he did not ſimply ſay, that all things are ful of Souls, but in ſome ſort, <hi>viz.</hi> in all things in a manner there is ſuch a like ſubſtance, which when all impediments being removed it hath got a ſitting matter, it rouſes it ſelf and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms the Office of a Soul.
<note place="margin">What 'tis to live.</note> For, to live, is not to have and contain a Soul after any faſhion; but to participate the ſame and to be informed by it, and as that which frames and preſerves the organical Body. For, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> teaches, Animal heat, and conſequently that which hath the Soul adjoyned thereto, is truly in all the lower part of the world, the Air, Water and Earth: but not as their eſſential part or attribute; ſince the Earth and Water are of their own Nature cold, and neither of them are informed by any Soul: but as a thing placed in a place or Veſſel, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe the Earth, Water and Air, do contain the Carkaſſes parts and Excrements of Living Things, in which are Atomes and ſmal Bodies having Souls in them. And ſo the Generation of things Spontaneous is then cauſed, when the Souls (as <hi>Fort. Licetus</hi> ſpeaks) are now by the benefit of heat united and aſſociated to ſuch things in which they were contained only as in a place or Veſſel, under the notion of a Cauſe efficient, forming an organical Body; or as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaks, when the matter ſhall comprehend that ſame heat of Animals and the Soul with it, and ſhall make it proper to it ſelf; preſently by way of Spontaneous Generation that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter receives the Conſiſtency of a living Nature, putting on the Soul in Nature of a Form, which before it contained diſtinct from its Nature, like a Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel.</p>
                  <p>Concerning which thing <hi>Fort.
<note place="margin">The ſoul is two waies in the matter</note> Licetus</hi> treats at large, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Spont. Vivent. Ortu, Cap.</hi> 11.28. <hi>et Seq.</hi> and endeavors with much labor to prove, that the form and Soul is two waies in the matter, <hi>viz.</hi> as an act and perfection in its proper ſubject, and then as a thing contained in a Veſſel, not belonging at al thereto, or as an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the ſubject. And this diſtinction is the foundation of his whole Doctrine of the original of theſe kind of Creatures. 'Tis not worth while to cite here all that he there alleadges. For ſure it is, the Fire with its form is in the Iron, is in the hot Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is in Rain, is in the Earth, and yet doth not inform them. And which is a moſt clear example, Gold reſolved into its ſmalleſt Atomes is in <hi>Aqua Regia,</hi> and Silver in <hi>Aqua Fortis;</hi> yet ſo as to retain their forms entire, as appears by their
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:35070:188"/>Reduction; yet they do not inform thoſe Waters, but the Form of Gold and Silver is in the Waters, as in a place. The ſame appears in the Souls of living Things. For the Seed caſt into the Earth is therein as in a place, nor is the Earth informed by the form of the Seed. Yea and which is much more wonderful, the Form of a Plant will ſomtimes remain in dry Wood, as <hi>Virgil</hi> writes of the Wood of an Olive Tree, in the Second of his Husbandry.

                  <p>But whether Souls may properly be ſaid to be in a place, and whether all the Souls of Spontaneous Creatures are thus in the things whence they ſpring, I doubt. Truly if Seed, or a Body anſwering to Seed conſiſting of matter and form, may be ſaid to be in a place, as Frogs ſpawn, or that Seminal Body out of which after Raine Plants do Spring, it is rightly ſaid to be in a place. But whether the Soul it ſelf which is therein, in the Water, or Rain, may properly be ſaid to be in a place, I doubt. But let us thus take the Soul with its proper ſubject, and let it in this manner be ſaid to be in a place: yet whether after the ſame manner in a Pine, out of which Ear-wigs, or in other woods whence worms ſpring, or in Corn whence the Wibbles are Generated, that Soul of the living Creature be preſent, may be juſtly doubted. For the Atomes of Gold and Silver conſiſting of their matter and Form, are in the <hi>Aqua Regia</hi> or <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> as in a place: and the Seed of ſome Plant or Frog, conſiſting of a Soul and matter, wherein the Soul is as in its proper ſubject, may be in the Earth or Water, as in a Veſſel or place, but by means of the matter or Body wherein it is. But when of Wood or Fleſh a live Animal is bred, there the Soul which of it ſelf is in no place, hath no matter wherein it may be as its own proper ſubject, and in reſpect of which it may be ſaid to be, in Wood or Fleſh, as in a place or Veſſel; but the proper ſubject of that Soul is that ſame thing or Fleſh, wherein nevertheleſs it is not formally, but only really, nor hath the notion of a Soul, but then begins to be formally, and to be ſeparated from the Wood and Fleſh, and to live and exiſt by it ſelf, and to have the notion of a Soul, and to exerciſe living operations, when through putrefaction or rather the heat joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the putrefaction, that matter is ſo elaborated that it may become a fit ſubject wherein the Soul may formally exiſt.</p>
                  <p>And therfore as was ſaid before,
<note place="margin">Spontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation how maniſold?</note> there is not only one way of Generation of Plants and Animals which are Generated of their own accord. For ſome are indeed Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated from Seed bred by a living Creature of the ſame kind, although they ſeem to be Generated of their own accord. So, after overflowings of water, after Rains and Winds, Plants do ſomtimes ſpring of themſelves, of Swines dung Thiſtles and Sow-Thiſtles are bred. In which there is no other difference betwixt the Spontaneous and non Spontaneous, ſave that in the former the Seed lies hidden, in the latter it is manifeſt. And there are Seeds of different Nature. For ſome unleſs they be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently lookt to and manured they loſe their Seminal faculty and their Soul. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers although they ſeem corrupted, yet in a certain Juyce or in ſome Atomes the Seminal faculty is preſerved. Again there are other Spontaneous live Things which are bred without Seed, as when of Cheeſe, Fleſh or Wood, Worms are bred, in which there is no ſuch Seed found as is in the Waters and in the Earth.</p>

Ortu, Cap.</hi> 36. holds that the efficient Generating Cauſe of Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous Animal, is a Soul of the ſame Nature with that whereby ſuch Animals are conſtituted in their being, but not quickening nor any waies actuating the ſubject wherein it is, but lying concealed, as in a veſſel, in that Carkaſs out of which theſe Animals are Generated: and that the Soul which is in the Carkaſs is the ſame with that which did conſtitute the Animal or other living thing, but impaired, not having the notion of an actuating form, and perfecting that wherein it is, but of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; ſince ſuch an impairing deprives the Soul of its Ancient perfection, which was to quicken and perfect its ſubject Body. For as a ſenſitive and ſeeing Soul is an habit in an Animal that is found; but in one that is blind, it being evervated by the marring of the Organ it degenerates into Privation: ſo alſo he holds that after
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:35070:189"/>Death the Soul of an Animal which remains in the Carkaſs degenerates into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and being weakned it Creates Spontaneous imperfect Animals.</p>
                  <p>Now how the Soul is caſt down from that perfection, he teaches <hi>in the ſame Book Cap.</hi> 37. and ſets down two waies, by which the matter of the Carkaſs obtains a non-Quickening Soul. The firſt is; that when the Live-Creature dies, all the heat neceſſary to life is not aboliſhed, but ſo much of it remains as ſuffices to retain the Soul in the Body, as in a Veſſel. In which caſe, he writes, that as it may happen frequently, that together with the weakning of the heat and Death of the living Thing, the ſubſtance of the vegetable and ſenſitive Soul ſupported by that heat may ſuffer an Eſſential Empairement, whereby it may come to degenerate into a more imperfect nature and a baſer kind of Soul; ſo he conceives it may ſomtimes come to paſs, that retaining its Ancient Eſſence it may put forth its weakned forces. The other manner he makes to be this: becauſe, ſaith he, while the old living Creature dies, and while the Excrement is driven out of the Body of the living Creature, its Soul yet remaining may introduce a new Soul into the next matter lately bereft of the ſame Soul, with a ſmal heat in the firſt inſtant of Nature, not yet able to vivifie its ſubject Body, but may be bred therein as in a Veſſel, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of the very ſame ſort with the generating Soul; but moſt frequently imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecter and Baſer: both becauſe of the imperfection of the matter, which cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſo perfect a Soul, as alſo by Reaſon of the Infirmity and Debility of the forces of the Soul Generating, which in the Death of the former Animal either periſhes, or is very much weakned, that it cannot engender one like it ſelf, but is able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce one inferior to it ſelf. Of which he treates at large to the 39. <hi>Chapter;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in at laſt he concludes his Opinion in theſe words: the immediate efficient Cauſe of the original of Spontaneous living Things from which they immediately receive their Soul and all Spontaneous living Things are generated, is nothing elſe but a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable or ſenſitive Soul, abiding in the Carkaſs, or in the Excrement proceeding from living Creatures, as in a Veſſel, lying hid with a weak heat, not actuating the ſame, nor any waies perfecting it, ſomtimes of the ſame ſort, or alſo Numerically the ſame with that which was formerly in thoſe living things: yet many times of a different ſort and a more baſe Nature, and imperfecter ſubſtance; into which with the decay of the Body and heat, the former Soul is degenerated: which Soul in the Carkaſs or Excrements, proceeding from the former living Creature not quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning its ſubject Body, it remains therein, not exerciſing the actions of life, not as a form in its ſubject, but as in a place, and in a veſſel, as it were by neceſſity of the matter, or at laſt by the total vaniſhing of the heat whereby it is ſupported, it ſelf periſhing; or with the augmentation of the ſaid heat and vigour acquired from the Warmth of the Ambient Air, communicating it ſelf to its ſubject Body, as a form and quickning Soul, and performing the functions of life, as ſhaping of a Body and generating of a Spontaneous live thing.</p>
                  <p>But in very good deed,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>the opinion of</hi> Licetus <hi>examined.</hi>
                     </note> it ſeems hard to hold, that the former Soul remains in the Carkaſs; and to affirm it in a man, is moſt abſurd: whereas nevertheleſs worms are as well bred of the Carkaſs of a man, as of other Animals. Indeed, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 39. <hi>Licetus</hi> excepts the rational Soul, and writes that only the Senſitive and Vegetative Souls remain. But it is only affirmed and not proved, that there are three Souls in a Man, of which the Senſitive and Vegetative may remain after his Death. Yea and in Brutes that ſame degenerating of nobler forms unto leſs noble is abſurd, and is propounded without Reaſon. Rather the Conſtitution of Body and various operations do ſhew, that Spontaneous Animals which are Generated out of dead Bodies do differ in kind and Form from thoſe Creatures out of which they are bred. Nor doth he ſhew any Reaſon, why the Soul of the living Creature ſhould degenerate into the Soul of this creeper rather then another: ſince we ſee that every Spontaneous Animal is not bred of every living thing, but certain Animals are bred of certain Bodies. Nor in a blind Man doth the ſeeing Soul degenerate into a Privati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but in the Eye, becauſe of the diſeaſe thereof, Privation of ſight is introduced; but the ſoul it ſelf hath the ſame perfection it had before, and the diſeaſe being removed fees again; nor while a man is blind doth it perform other operations. Yea, and the Soul while it lives informs the blind Eye, although it cannot cauſe ſight therein by reaſon of its diſeaſe. And if the ſoul ſhould remain in the eye of a blind man, as it doth
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:35070:189"/>in a Carkas, contributing nothing thereto, the Eye would be mortified and Sphacela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but we ſee the contrary. And although it is true that ſome part of innate heat and Radical moiſture remains in the Carkaſſes of Plants and Animals, which is not deſtroied ſave by Putrefaction and Rottenneſs which many times happens long after Death; yet that temper and heat of the living Thing doth not remain, and therefore neither can the ſpecifick Soul of the living thing remain; ſeeing the death of an Animal and of a live Thing is the extinction of that Vital heat, and thereby Souls are ſeparated from their Bodies, but the Soul doth no way ſuffer any eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al impairment (for the Eſſence of forms is indiviſible) whereby it can degenerate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a more imperfect Nature. And when a living Thing is Generated of the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Animals, it is not credible that the Soul remains in the Excrements; ſince in the living Body, the Soul was never in the Excrements.</p>
                  <p>But to me it ſeems more agreeable to truth,
<note place="margin">The opinion of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the original of Spontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Live things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called.</note> that in living Things there are divers Auxiliary and ſubordinate forms, yet ſo that one is principal and Queen, which informs the living Creature, and from which the living thing hath its Name, <hi>viz.</hi> The Soul it ſelf of every living Thing; and the reſt are Servants as it were, which as long as that ſuperior and Lady Soul is preſent, do pertain to the diſpoſition and condition of the matter, and therefore they do after a ſort inform the ſaid matter, that it may be a ſit ſubject for the ſpecifick form, and they have alſo actions of their own, yet they do not animate the ſame, nor do they give it the Name of a living thing; which is the Office of a ſpecifick Soul only.
<note place="margin">There are ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſouls.</note> Nor let any man hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully traduce this Doctrine of ſubordinate forms as new.

Alſo he writes <hi>in the ſame place,</hi> that it is commonly repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that of Wig-Lice broken Wig-Lice do alſo engender. Which he counts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely. But that from the ſame original whence thoſe that are broken did ariſe, new ones are Generated in the ſame place. But I ſee no cauſe why thoſe rudiments of the Wig-Lice may not remain in thoſe that are rubbed in pieces. <hi>Shegkius</hi> the German, <hi>Ariſtotle, de Occultis Med. Facult. Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Page</hi> 103. <hi>in my Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> ſaies, it will be no abſurdity, if we ſhall ſay that divers forms are in one ſubſtance. And afterwards, he proves in Plants, that the ſpecifical form being aboliſhed, there remains not only the temperament, but alſo the ſubſtantial form, and that it is the Author of Occult Faculties. <hi>Zabarella</hi> alſo, <hi>Lib. de Gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at. and Interitu, Cap</hi> 4. writes, that the form of a mixt Body in a living Creature doth not perform the Office of a form, in reſpect of the whole living Creature, but rather of Matter. But that the Soul being taken away, the ſame Form of mixture begins to perform the Office of a Form, and to conſtitute that Body ſpecifically. And this he declares in the ſame place by an example. Juſt as, (ſaith he) if when a King is dead ſome Servant be made King, he was alſo before during the Kings Life, but he was not as King; and therefore if any ſhal ask whether a new King be created or no, anſwer ought doubtleſs to be made, that a new King is created, and the King is changed. Even ſo, at the Death of a living Creature, a new Form is acquired, inaſmuch as that which was before as a Condition of the matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubject to a more noble Form, doth now begin to be a Form to conſtitute the compound, and to bear Rule. And that which <hi>Zabarella</hi> ſpeaks only of the forms of mixt bodies, that is to be underſtood of all Forms excepting the Elements, which are neceſſary to the Conſtitution of a living Body. And that there are ſuch Forms, is proved before in the <hi>Second Diſcourſe</hi> of this work. Nor doth it import any abſurdity, that beſides the ſpecifical Forms there ſhould be other ſubordinate Forms: but as <hi>Zabarella, Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Generat. &amp; Interit. Cap.</hi> 2. writes, if it be not againſt Reaſon there ſhould be two, neither is it that there ſhould be four or an hundred together in the ſame ſubject.</p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:35070:190"/>
                  <p> There is one who argues here,
<note place="margin">Whether the ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate forms are ſpecifical.</note> that ſubordinate Forms are alſo ſpecifical. But either he underſtands not what a ſpecifical Form is, or he cavils Maliciouſly; and in the mean time he grants in the ſame living thing divers forms. Verily, There is no form, which by it ſelf conſidered may not be termed ſpecifical. So the form of fire, where ever fire is, is ſpecifical: but when Fire is in a man, it is not the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick form of a Man, but the rational Soul is mans ſpecifick Form. He Fights there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with ſhadows, and Toies with cavillations, who denies ſubordinate Forms, and thinks they are not to be diſtinguiſhed from ſpecifick forms, becauſe they alſo are ſpecifick. The Form (ſaith he) of the Earth is under the command of a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Form, yet it is in its proper matter, and retains the Nature of a ſpecifick Form, although it be under another Specifick Form. For it is not the Specifick form of that thing to the Form whereof it is ſubject, but of that matter whoſe Form it is, with which it abides, comes and goes. But if the form of the Earth be ſubject to another Form, why ſhall I not term the ſame (with <hi>Zabarella</hi>) a ſubordinate Form? But in a Man to hold both the Form of Earth, and the Humane Form to be ſpecifical, is moſt abſurd. For there is no Natural thing which hath two ſpecifick Forms. Yet thoſe ſpecifick Forms which whiles they are in the living Thing do belong to the matter, the ſpecifical form departing, do become ſpecifical, as the ſame <hi>Zabarella</hi> teaches, and perform the operations of a ſpecifical Form. So that Form from whence there ariſes out of a Carkaſs a Beetle, a Waſp, a Bee, while it is in the Horſe, or other living Animal, it cannot be called the form of a Waſp, a Beetle or a Bee; ſince then it performs not the Office of a Form, but is in place of matter. But when it performs the Office of a Form, it can then multiply it ſelf, and beget its like. And indeed the Nature of a Form is far different when it is ſubordinate and in the place of matter, from what it is when it becomes ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical. Therefore alſo ſubordinate Forms do not give a Name to their ſubject, nor can I ſay that in a man there are Worms, in an Heyfer fed with Mulberry Leaves there are Silk-Worms, but at laſt when the Specifical Form departs, they begin to perform the Office of a ſpecifick Form, and give a Name to the thing.</p>
                  <p>Whence alſo that is of no moment which ſome Object, if the Soul of a Worm were in a Plant, the ſame ſubſtance would be a Plant and an Animal; ſince the Form gives as well the Name as being to a thing. For the ſpecies or Forms of Things, truly, are not ſimply known or defined by us according to their Eſſence, but ſo far forth, as being ſenſibly parts of the World, by their Bodies and actions they fall under our ſenſe; and a Name is given them, not from their eſſential act, but from their faculties and actions which they exerciſe in ſuch a ſubject. For indeed, the Seed of a Dog doth not eſſentially differ from a Dog: yet becauſe by the term Dog we do not underſtand ſimply the Soul of a Dog with any kind of matter, but a four footed barking Beaſt, the Form of a Dog in the Seed is not called a Dog, before it have ſhaped a Body fit for it ſelf. After the ſame manner, in a Silk-Worm and Butter-Fly, there is one and the ſame Soul, yet is it not termed a Butter-Fly, til it is changed into a Winged Creature. So alſo, in a Plant, though there is the Soul of a Worm, yet the plant is not termed an Animal, but the Government of the Plants form ceaſing, and another Soul receiving and exerciſing the Soveraignty, 'tis termed an Animal.</p>
                  <p>Nor can it be hence concluded (as ſome object and think it may) that there are in man and ſundry other Animals Worms,
<note place="margin">How ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate forms are in thinge.</note> or that this or that living Creature hath Worms or other live Things in it. For to the Conſtitution of ſuch Animals, as of all other Natural Bodies, there is requiſite not only a Form, but alſo a matter, and the Form ought to inform the ſaid matter. But thoſe Forms, though they are really in other living things, yet are they not therein in the Nature of forms, nor do they perform the Office of Forms, nor Animate the matter, nor quicken the Body, nor exerciſe the operations of life therein, but all theſe things are performed by the more noble and ſpecifick Form, or Soul of the living Thing: but they themſelves belong to the diſpoſition and determination of the matter. But when that ſpecifick and more noble Form or Soul goes away, they being ſtirred up by the ambient heat, and having gained a fit diſpoſition are advanced into the quality of Forms, and communicate themſeves to the Body as vivifying Souls, and in the firſt place they ſet themſelves to ſhape Bodies fit for them, but afterwards they begin to exerciſe
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:35070:190"/>therein the functions of Life.
<note place="margin">One Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal form may put on divers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ones</note> Yea and the ſame Forms do lie hid under different external Figures, and ſo paſs into the Theatre of Nature. 'Tis a clear caſe in the Palmer Worms, in which one Soul puts on divers Bodies, and as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> 5 <hi>de Hiſt. Animal. Cap.</hi> 19. and <hi>Pliny, Lib.</hi> 11. <hi>Nat. Hiſt. Cap.</hi> 22. ſaies, there is a various ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Forms, <hi>viz.</hi> external ones. For the internal remains the ſame. Which though it may ſeem to ſome abſurd: yet is it no waies abſurd, but it is eaſie for any one to make obſervation of the truth thereof. For firſt of all, of the Egg of a kind of Butter-Fly is made a Palmer Worm; this Worm, according as <hi>Libavius</hi> dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently hath obſerved, <hi>Singular. Part.</hi> 2. <hi>Bombycior. Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 21. in a months ſpace changes its Skin four times. And who will ſay, that here the internal form is changed; unleſs he will ſay when Snakes caſt their Skin that a new Generation is made. Afterwards, it becomes a Silk-worm; where again there is no eſſential mutation, for a Silk-Worm is no other then a Palmer Worm grown up. And when afterward it becomes a Nymph, there is again no eſſential mutation, but the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal form only working it becomes a Butter-Fly. Nor doth this happen only in the Palmer Worm and Silk-Worm, but in all Egg-bearers, as for example in the Chick of an Hen. For look as, while by the heat of a Bird of another kind, or alſo of the Fire, a Chick is hatched out of the Egg of an Hen, there cannot ſo much as any thing be imagined which ſhould give the Soul to the Chick, unleſs it had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Egg: ſo alſo when by the Warmth of Womens Dugs the Eggs of Silk-Worms are hatched, and there comes out Silk-Worms, nothing can be aſſigned which might generate the Soul. And that one Soul can aſſume various Bodies the degeneration alſo of Plants doth ſhew, whiles Rie and Barley do turn to Wheat, and Wheat again into Rye and Barley, the ſame internal Form remaining, and the external duly changed.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto alſo belongs the degeneration of Plants into other Plants;
<note place="margin">The dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Plants.</note> which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in thoſe Plants whoſe Seeds are either ambiguous, and contain divers forms in them, yet ſo as that one Rules and the other ſerves; unleſs upon occaſion ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alteration be made; or whoſe Soul is diſpoſed to receive divers forms ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, as appears in Silk-Worms, yea and Bees too. For as the ſame eſſence of a Form doth in them remain under divers external ſhapes, and firſt there is a Palmer Worm, then a Silk-Worm, then a Butter-Fly: ſo alſo in Plants, there is the ſame tranſmutation of the external Form. Which alſo <hi>Julius Caeſar Scaliger</hi> doth grant, when in 1 <hi>de Plantis,</hi> (ſaith he) there are the confuſed principles of divers things in Seeds, as of Rapes, Cole-worts, and others <hi>Licetus</hi> indeed <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Spont. Viv. Ort. Cap.</hi> 14. writes, that a Form upon great mutations of the matter is changed into another ſpecies, and depreſſed into a more inferior degree. But this degeneration upon the mutation of the matter is made not only into an inferior degree but alſo into a Superior: which experience doth teſtifie. Wheat degenerates into Darnel; Water-Creſſes into Mints; Rape into Radiſh; Baſil into running Betony; the white Vine into the black, and the black into the white; Barley into Wheat, and again Wheat into Barley. If in <hi>Hungaria</hi> they ſow German Rye it turns into Wheat. If a Field be ſomwhat barren, our White Oats (as they call them) degenerate into black; if the ſame Seed be ſowed ſome years together, it grows more baſe. And therefore after ſome years the Husband-men are forced to change their Seed. Contrariwiſe, if black Oates be ſowed in a fat Soil, white Oats will Spring up ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from. Gilly-flowers, Roſes, Violets, do oft change their Colours. Whence <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> writes of Seeds.

He therefore found among the Wheat frequent Darnel, and amongſt the Barley wild Barley or wild Oates; and made the ſame experiment in other Seeds. He therefore found in Lentils alſo, that they were changed into hard and round
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:35070:191"/>Vetches and Ax-wort, alſo Goof-graſs grow therefrom. If ſome would now adaies uſe the like diligence, they ſhould merit moſt worthy commendations.

And this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience would tend more to the gaining of the knowledg of Natural Philoſophy, then thoſe Vain ſpeculations, and more baſe then Ditch-Water, ſo much in requeſt.

                  <p>And ſo much may ſuffice to have ſaid of the primary efficient cauſe of the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Spontaneous live Things. Only this one thing is yet to be noted, that theſe degenerations are not properly Spontaneous Generations, ſince they are made of Seed and that evidently: although thoſe Forms, according to the divers diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the matter, have the power to ſhape ſundry figures of the external Body. Alſo the Ambient heat, eſpecially that of the Sun and Moon, do concur to their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration: but that heat is not the primary agent, but only ſtirs up the Soul which lies ſecretly hidden, and prepares and affords fitting matter to the ſame. And therefore that what we have ſaid of the Spontaneous original of living things may be more apparent, we muſt ſpeak yet ſomwhat concerning their matter.</p>

He ſaies the Spontaneous and non-Spontaneous Generation of live Things do herein agree, that each is made of a perfectly mixt Body being very near of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate complexion, having in it ſelf the laſt diſpoſition and immediate aptitude to receive a Soul for its Form; and that the preceding diſpoſition or that ſame priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both in the non-Spontaneous and the Spontaneous generation is nothing elſe
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:35070:191"/>but a temperament juſt under the degree of the Soul, not having the Soul any waies adjoyned thereto, and that it is a certain degree of heat. But that the difference is herein, that the non-Spontaneous Generation of a living thing is cauſed by an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal agent, firſt preparing the matter for it ſelf by previous alteration, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward when it is prepared, by way of Generation furniſhing the ſame with a Soul: but contrariwiſe, the Spontaneous Generation of living things is cauſed by an agent lurking within the matter, prepared by virtue of the Ambient Aire. And that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the diſpoſition of the matter ſubſervient to the Spontaneous Original of living things is nothing elſe but Coction by the Ambient Heat. Moreover he laies down two attributes of the immediate matter of Spontaneous live Things. The firſt is, that no Animal can be Spontaneouſly generated, ſave of a matter which was alſo before in ſome ſort living, and Animated, either in the rank of Plants or of Animals, whether it be the part of a living Thing, or the Fruit, or the Excrement, or ſomwhat elſe belonging thereto; which nevertheleſs hath not now its Soul any longer as a form, but contains it as a Veſſel, foraſmuch as it belongs not to the eſſence of the Carkaſs wherein it is contained. Another is, that it muſt be immediately collected and prepared by the heat of the Ambient Aire, that it may put on the Soul and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a living Creature, either of the ſame ſort with the former, or of another ſort. For when the matter hath comprehended a natural heat and made it its own, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently it attains a living Nature, and puts on a Soul under the notion of a Form, which before it contained only as a Veſſel, being diſtinct from its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>But in good truth, this Opinion needs a convenient Explication and Limitation.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The opinion of</hi> Licetus <hi>examined.</hi>
                     </note> For in the firſt place, we muſt needs here repeat what we ſaid before, that there is not one manner of Generation of Spontaneous living Things, but ſome proceed from a concealed ſeed of the ſame kind, as when of a ſecret Seed a Plant is Generated after Rain, even out of Stones; and others do Spring from dead Carkaſſes. And therefore, the firſt attribute of the matter of Spontaneous live Things, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is a Carkaſs, wherein there is a Soul as in a Veſſel, not Animating, doth agree only to the ſecond kind. But if, as he himſelf holds <hi>Lib. 3. Cap.</hi> 117. ſome powder or Juyce of a plant, having in it a Seminal principle, ſhal creep into the Chink of ſome Stone, being brought thither by Rain, there truly a Plant doth not grow out of a Carkaſs, but out of a Seed of the ſame fort. Which alſo happens out of the Dung and excrements of Animals, in which there is either undigeſted Seed, or ſome Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Juyce. For, as was ſaid before, the Seminal principle is not in al Plants Seed peculiarly ſo called, which is Generated in a certain part of the Plant endued with a certain Form external, but in ſome it is diffuſed through the whole Plant, as in the Wllow, and therefore a Willow may be generated by a bough pluckt off from the Tree and Planted in the ground. When therefore of ſuch a Seed or ſuch a Seminal Juyce a Plant is bred, either in the Earth, or in a Stone, or in another Tree, there the plant is not made of a Carkaſs, but of Seed. Moreover, this alſo wants explanation; when he writes, that the matter of which ſuch a Generation is made muſt be very near temperate. For this indeed is true of the efficient cauſe. For neither a faint heat nor a burning heat can diſpoſe the matter to receive a ſoul, but it ought to be moderate and of a digeſtive Nature. But I think it is not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that the matter which is bred by that digeſtion ſhould be temperate in all. For there is a great difference in reſpect of temper in the Bodies Generated. For worms are bred of Cole-worts, Wormwood, Pitch wood, Fleſh, which have moſt differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Temperaments.</p>
                  <p>But as to the difference betwixt Spontaneous and non-Spontaneous Generation,
<note place="margin">The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Spontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and non-ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tax<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>.</note> true indeed it is, that in the non-Spontaneous Generation of living Things, or that which is cauſed by Seed, the matter is Elaborated by the Soul of the living Thing in the Body thereof, and is ſo prepared, that that which before was not (for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the Blood in Animals nor the Alimentary Juyce in Plants Animated) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a fit ſubject for a Soul, and the Soul communicates it ſelf thereto, and then it is called Seed, out of which afterwards when it is cheriſhed by the heat of the Womb or the Sun, or ſome other thing, and the Latent Soul ſtirred up, a living Creature of the ſame kind ſprings forth. But after this manner the firſt kind of Spontaneous live Things doth not differ in manner of their Generation from that lately decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. For ſince, as <hi>Jul. Caeſ. Scaliger</hi> ſaies rightly, <hi>Exercit. 6. Sect.</hi> 10. a Tree or
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:35070:192"/>Plant generates when it produces ſeed, but not when the Tree or Plant Springs up out of the Seed, but then the thing generated which was before imperfect becomes perfect. That Seminal principle, out of which either in the Water or in the Earth or out of Stones, Plants Spring without the culture of man, was Generated in Plants of the ſame kind, and did for a ſeaſon lie hid in the Water, Earth, or Stone, til it obtained a fit matter whereof to frame it ſelf a Body. And then if that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of a Plant ſhall be counted a generation, it is alſo performed by an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal principle. But in the other kind of Spontaneous living things, when Worms are bred of the Carkaſſes or Excrements of Plants, the Soul is alſo preſent in the Carkaſs, although not under the notion of a ſpecifical Form, yet realy notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. But it cannot proceed into act, and exerciſe the Office of a Form and Soul, nor can it prepare a matter whereto to communicate it ſelf, which is done in Plants and Animals, but there is need of the Heat either of the Ambient air, or that which ariſes from pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>refaction, that the matter may be fitly prepared and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; which when it hath obtained the ſaid form begins to put it ſelf forth, and to exerciſe the function of a Soul. Alſo the influx of the Heaven and eſpecially of the Moon, doth not a little aſſiſt towards the introduction of ſuch a diſpoſition. For experience teaches that Wood which is cut a little before the new moon is not eaſily infeſted with Worms; contrariwiſe, ſuch as is cut about the full-Moon is moſt ſubject to Worms. So out of mud which is dug up about the New-Moon to make furnaces and Hearths,
<note place="margin">The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous live things</note> Crickets are eaſily bred. Now the Bodies in which theſe Souls lie hid are either the Carkaſſes of Living things, or parts of the ſaid Carkaſſes, or the fruits or Excrements of living Things, of which very things <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle 2 de Generat. Animal. Cap.</hi> 3. expreſly writes, that they have a vital principle; and thoſe Souls did pertain to the diſpoſition of the matter which was the proper ſubject of that living thing. Hence it is, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaies well, that every form requires its proper matter, that as the Souls of living things differ, ſo alſo thoſe ſubordinate Forms which conſtitute the proper matter for every Soul muſt differ, and therefore every Animal is not bred of every Carkaſs, or of every part of a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or dead Body, or of every Excrement, but determinate Animals are bred of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate matter. Of Fleſh one kind of Worms and none elſe is bred; of Cheeſe Mites proper thereto and no other: of the Leaves of Herbs Palmer-Worms; of the Pine the <hi>Bupreſtes</hi> and Pityocampe, and no other Worms; of Horſe dung a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſort of Beetles; Long-worms bred in the Guts; Lice and Fleas in the ſoyl of the Skin; a certain kind of Worms and Beetles under the Shoes, of the ſilth of the Feet.</p>

But this is a great ſuppoſition, that a ſoul ſhould remain in the Carkaſs of an Animal after its Death; as alſo that theſe Forms ſhould be changed into other ſpecies. Nor is it truly credible, that the ſoul of a Pitch-Tree, or a Pine-Tree ſhould be changed into a worm, or the ſoul of an Horſe into a Waſp. And when Worms are bred of the Excrements of Animals. Whence hath the ſoul its Original in ſuch a caſe? Yet we grant, that the ſoul or ſeminal principle of ſuch things as have been once generated of their own accord, their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy being corrupted, may ſtick in ſome matter, and come to live again. So Flies and Frogs may melt in the mud, and of that corrupt matter in the ſpring time other Flies and Frogs may breed. But all theſe things ſhall be hereafter made more manifeſt, in our Particular Diſcourſe of the Original of Spontaneous live Things, where we ſhall ſpeake of all the ſorts of them.</p>
                  <p>To conclude therefore this preſent ſubject,
<note place="margin">The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous live things</note> this I conceive may be moſt probably held concerning the matter of theſe kind of Creatures: (ſince there are two kinds of Spontaneous live Things, as was ſaid before;) that in the former the Seminal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as the proper ſubject of the ſoul, is communicated from the Generator it ſelf, and that ſo diſpoſed, that it can retain the ſoul though it be divided never ſo ſmal.
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:35070:192"/>Nor is this abſurd;
<note place="margin">Forms re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in Atomes.</note> but that forms may be contained in the ſmalleſt Atomes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible to the ſenſes, even Metals do ſhew, which are diſſolved into their ſmalleſt particles by <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> and <hi>Aqua Regia,</hi> ſo as they may be ſtrained through a paper, and yet nevertheleſs they retain their Eſſence entire in thoſe ſmal particles, as by reduction doth appear. Whereof we have ſpoke at large in the <hi>Third Diſcourſe, Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>of this Work.</hi> But in the other kind, as in dead Carkaſſes, the Soul hath that ſubject wherein it was in the living Body, while it was in place of an immediate matter to the ſuperior Form. But as the Seeds of non-Sponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Live Things although they are caſt into the ground do not alwaies put forth their inbred Virtue, but are corrupted, ſomtimes by cold, ſomtimes by heat, or through want of fit nutriment, and ſo come to die, or to reſt a long time before they put themſelves into action; (as many Seeds reſt al the Winter in the ground, until by the heat of the Ambient Air they be cheriſhed, and can draw fit nouriſhment out of the Earth:) ſo alſo in thoſe things which are ſaid to ariſe Spontaneouſly, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal virtue reſts, til it obtain a fit matter out of which to frame it ſelf a Body, and be rouſed up by the heat of the Ambient Air, and cheriſhed: whence it comes to paſs, that Animals which ariſe of their own accord are not generated in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, unleſs ſomtimes under Dung, where the cold cannot come, but in the Spring, Summer and Autumne, <hi>viz.</hi> When by the heat of the Ambient Air cauſed chiefly by the Sun and Moon, a fit matter is afforded, out of which the Latent Soul may frame it ſelf a Body, and the Soul it ſelf may be ſet on work. But ſomtimes this ſame Seminal Virtue doth quite periſh and die. Nor would I have any Man carp at what I have hitherto ſaid and ſhall hereafter ſay concerning Souls, and the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Virtue in Atomes and ſmalleſt bodies, and charge me as if I held that ſuch ſouls, becauſe in ſo many mutations they remain entire, are immortal. For,
<note place="margin">The Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal virtue ſomtimes dies.</note> as the ſeeds of non-Spontaneous Plants do many times remain long entire, and yet at laſt die: the ſame may alſo happen in the Spontaneous, <hi>viz.</hi> if they meet with ſome contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or the matter be too much divided. Concerning which thing <hi>Franciſc. Agui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius, Lib. 5. de Optic. Propoſ.</hi> 8. thus writes: although there is no ſmalleſt quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, yet there is the ſmalleſt light Natural, that is, a light ſo weak and thin, that it cannot be made thinner without periſhing. After which manner there are alſo the ſmalleſt parts of Natural Bodies; <hi>viz.</hi> which if they be further divided they loſe their Form and Eſſence. And <hi>Propoſ.</hi> 15. And this Imbecillity of Subſiſtency is common not only to theſe qualities which admit the diverſity of greater and leſſer, but alſo to al Bodies which vary their magnitude. For as theſe without ſome bulk, ſo the other without ſome degree of excellency cannot preſerve themſelves from periſhing. For their forces being further attenuated do periſh and come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, not deſtroied by any contrary, but only through want of meaſure, which is a neceſſary condition by the irrefragable law of Nature required for the proper maintenance of every one. For that which <hi>Aguilonius</hi> ſpeaks here concerning qualities muſt alſo be underſtood of Forms from whence the qualities do flow.</p>
                  <p>Now one there is, who from this Doctrine indeavors to Calumniate me,
<note place="margin">The ſouls of Brute Beaſts are not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal.</note> as if I held that al the Forms of Beaſts are ſeparable, and may exſiſt in the firſt act, out of their matter, and that therefore they are immortal. For this never came into my mind, but I have held with all Philoſophers, that no Form ſaving the Humane is ſeparable from its matter, but doth periſh therewith. Yet this we muſt hold, that al Forms are not of the ſame kind, but ſome ſo coupled to their Bodies and perfect, that the ſaid Bodies periſhing, they alſo periſh, ſuch as are the Forms of an Ox, a Lyon, a Gooſe, a Crow, and of other perfect Animals. Nor can it be that the Body of a Lyon, an Horſe, a Gooſe, a Crow, being deſtroyed, the Souls of the ſaid Animals ſhould remain alive. But it is otherwiſe in plants, wherein the Soul may remain in the Root, Seed, branch, Leaf, yea and as ſhal be ſhewn hereafter, in the Juyce. And the ſame holds in Inſects, whoſe Soul may be preſerved in baſe matter unfurniſhed with Organs. Yet theſe Forms cannot exiſt any where, but though they are not in an Organical Body, yet they are in a proper matter, and indeed the very ſame which was their matter in an Organical Body. Much leſs are they immortal, but that matter periſhing or being corrupted, they alſo are aboliſhed, as was lately ſaid.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THere remains yet one thing to be explained in General,
<note place="margin">Sundry opinions concerning the end of Spontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things.</note> 
                     <hi>viz.</hi> to what end Spontaneous living Things are Generated. For that ſuch Things are not made by Chance or Fortune, was ſaid before. But concerning the end of theſe things ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral men are of ſeveral minds. Some are of Opinion, that they are therefore ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, that putrid matter might be conſumed, and the Air by that means purged. For ſince out of putrid Bodies many bad exhalations are lifted up, which defile the Air, whereby afterwards more perfect Animals are hurt and become diſeaſed; to prevent this, and to provide for the health of men and other perfect Animals, they hold that Nature produces theſe petty Creatures, and ſpends the matter both in their Generation and nutrition. But in good deed, theſe petty Animals are neither generated of putrid matter as ſuch, nor are they nouriſhed therewith. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are made of matter which putrifies, yet are they not made thereof as it is putrid, but rather of the digeſted and better part thereof being Separated from the putrid. And therefore after the Generation of Worms and ſuch like Animals, putrid matter remains, which pollutes the Air no leſs then it did before. Nor are theſe petty Animals which are Generated out of putrifying matter nouriſhed by putrid matter, but ſeek their food upon other Creatures, as Plants and live Animals. Nor are thoſe Countries or places where theſe Creatures are plentifully bred, more healthful, but for the moſt part more unhealthful then other places.</p>
                  <p>Others are of this Opinion, that as other created things, ſo theſe alſo are made for the ſake of Man. But <hi>Julius Caeſar Scaliger, Exercit.</hi> 250. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. doth juſtly laugh at them who ſay that Fleas were created for mans ſake, to ſuck out his unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Blood, or that Wig-Lice are ſent by Nature to wake us out of our ſleep in the nights, that we might pray to God. For are not Dogs alſo and other brutes ful of Fleas and Lice?</p>
                  <p>Others, as <hi>Avicenna,</hi> do hold that it is better that Lice ſhould be bred, then that the putrid matter ſhould ſo remain; and they acknowledg rate workmanſhip in the ſtructure of ſuch petty Animals. Others conceive ſuch Animals were made for the perfection of the Univerſe, and that not only perfect Animals, but alſo ſuch imperfect ones as theſe do make for the Pulchritude and Integrity thereof. Which <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſeems to have taught, who <hi>in the place forecited</hi> thus writes: Man for God, and the World is made for man. And <hi>a little after:</hi> Man is the Prince of Animals. Now man ſhould not have been Prince, if he had not been ſuch as he is; <hi>viz.</hi> in the middle. He could not be in the middle, ſave betwixt extreams. Extreams were therefore made, that he might be in the middeſt. They were therefore made for the ſake of the middlemoſt. Now if any of the extreams, or of thoſe which are betwixt the middle and the extreams were wanting, there would be a Vacuity or Empty ſpace among the forms. Which would be a greater fault in Nature, then an empty ſpace without a Body. For what is more abſurd then a middle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out extreams?</p>
                  <p>Which two laſt Opinions ſeem not much different,
<note place="margin">The true Opinion.</note> and are convenient enough, if rightly explained. For God the Work-Maſter of all things would every where diſcover his Wiſdom and power, and therefore was rather willing that living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſhould be multiplied in Nature, then corrupt and putrid matter; and that the Bodies of perfect Animals when they are corrupted ſhould rather turn to Ignoble Animals, then meer putrid matter. Which kind of Animals are various, yet determinate, and every one according to their kind. For ſeeing, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> well writes, that as Souls differ one from another in Nobleneſs and baſeneſs, ſo alſo the Nature of that Body wherein they are, and which is the proper ſubject of every Soul, doth differ: this difference muſt needs proced from ſome Form, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in the living Body of perfect Animals it is inſtead of matter; yet afterward, the Soul departing, it rouſes it ſelf up, and performs that which is in its power to do. Hence, look how many ſorts of perfect Bodies there are, ſo many ſorts there are alſo of Animals ariſing from them; of which alſo <hi>Auſtin, Lib.</hi> 12. <hi>de Civitate
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:35070:193"/>Dei. Cap.</hi> 4. to count (ſaies he) the faults of Beaſts, and Trees,
<note place="margin">The Glory of God ſhines in the ſmalleſt Creatures.</note> and other mutable and mortal things, wanting either underſtanding, or Senſe, or Life, to be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, is a ridiculous Thing: ſince thoſe Creatures have by the will of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter received that manner of being, that by going and coming they might perfect the loweſt Pulchritude of times, agreeable to the parts of this world, according to their kind. <hi>And a little after:</hi> the beauty of which order therefore delights us not, becauſe in this condition of our mortality being interwoven therein we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcerne the whole, to which the particles which offend us are decently and aptly fitted. And <hi>Again:</hi> Nature conſidered in her ſelf and not with reference to our commodity or diſcommodity Gloriſies her Work-Maſter. For living Things make a nobler degree of Bodies, then things ſimply mixed. And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf 1 <hi>de Part. Animal Cap.</hi> 5. (which place alſo we cited before) acknowledges the Wiſdom of the moſt good and great God, in ſuch petty Animals, while he thus writeth: <hi>With a Childiſh ſcornfulneſs to deſpiſe and be troubled at the diſputation and conſideration of the meaner ſort of Animals, is an unworthy thing: ſince there is nothing in Nature which hath not ſome wonder in it. And that which</hi> Heraclitus <hi>is reported to have ſaid to thoſe who coming to ſpeak with him, and becauſe they found him fitting in a Bakers Shop Warming him at the Oven, they ſtept back and would not go to him; come in boldly quoth he, and be not aſhamed, for the Immortal Gods are even in this place al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. The ſame muſt be done in the ſearching out of the Nature of Animals. For we ought to attempt every thing, without any ſhame ſince the Divinity of Nature is in them all, and her comly and beautiful Artifice. For that is every where chiefty joyned to the works of Nature, where nothing is done raſhly and by chance, but all to ſome end and purpoſe. Now the end for which any thing is, or was made, hath in it the Notion of goodneſs and Honeſty. But if any man think the contemplation of other Animals to be Baſe and Vile, be muſt needs think the ſame of himſelf alſo, for we cannot behold without much loathing thoſe things whereof the Body of man conſiſts, as Blood, Fleſh, Bones, Veins, and ſuch like.</hi> So far <hi>Ariſtotle.

Yea and the more Ignoble ſort of Animals ſome of them, although they ſomtimes ſeem deprived of life, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe no Second act of the Soul, as it happens in Flies, Frogs and ſome other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, which lie all Winter long as it were dead: yet the Soul lying hid even in vile matter doth vivifie the ſame, and being in the Spring cheriſhed and awakened by the Ambient heat, it exerciſes vital actions by the Second act, and is then ſaid to revive again. Moreover there is no living thing, out of whoſe Carkaſs Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Urine, Sweat, Vapors, and ſteams going out of the Body, and filth gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Skin and Garments ſundry kinds of Worms are not produced; ſo that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid rightly, that all things were after a ſort ful of Souls. Now the Soul which lies hid in ſuch things as proceed from perfect Animals, and afterwards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from them, is alwaies of an inferior degree and ſort, but never of the ſame or an higher, unleſs they be ſome imperfect Animals, as was newly ſaid of Flies and Frogs. For the ſame Soul cannot inform Bodies of divers ſorts, nor cannot any thing act beyond its ſtrength. And although as was alſo ſaid before, <hi>Fortunius Licetus, Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. teaches that the ſame Soul, or of the ſame ſort and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition with the Soul of the former live thing, is in Spontaneous live things: yet that may not be allowed, for the cauſe aforeſaid. And the Nature of Degenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is far different from that of the Spontaneous Original of living Things. For in degeneration, as alſo in Silk-Worms and Butter-Flies, it may happen, that the ſame Soul may be in divers bodies, and ſo be naturally diſpoſed to put on divers external Forms, as when Rye is turned into Wheat, and of the Egg is made a Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-worm, then a Silk-Worm, then a Butter-Fly: but in Spontaneous Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, properly ſo called and of the ſecond kind, it is impoſſible, that a more noble Form ſhould remain in the Carkaſs or Excrements. But theſe things will be more clearly underſtood, now we come to particulars.</p>

                  <p>In the firſt place all Puckfiſts are generated without any tillage or manifeſt Seed, which as <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaies are to themſelves Root, Stem and Fruit; alſo Muſhroms, and Toad-ſtools, which ſpring up ſo ſwiftly that they are generated in one Night, and attain that greatneſs which belongs to their Nature. For they neither afford any Seed of which to be generated, nor are they procreated and multiplied by ſetting any part of them into the ground. Since therefore they are bred of their own accord, they muſt needs have the common way of generation with other Spontaneous Live things of which we ſpake before. For whereas <hi>Matthiolus</hi> writes, that the Earth by an hidden faculty doth breed Puck-fiſts, and Muſhroms in her ſelf, that muſt be fitly explained. For the Earth is not in it ſelf and by its own Nature the efficient Cauſe of Puck-fiſts and Toad-Stools, but a Soul lying hid in the Earth, or in ſome Juyce mingled with the Earth. But whence that Soul pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds is not ſo manifeſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fortunius Licetus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Whence toad-ſtools have their Soul.</note> 
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Spont. Viv. Ort Cap.</hi> 4. thus writes thereof: the Spontaneous Original of Puck-ſiſts and all Toad-ſtools in general, is, when the Soul of a more perfect living thing, Plant or Animal, abiding in the Carkaſs, as in a Veſſel, being much impaired, and having gotten a matter not exactly diſpoſed, and having none of the beſt inſtruments for the Organization of the parts, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates it ſelf for a Form and quickening Soul to the ſubject matter, firſt diſpoſed by the moiſt warmth or heat of the Ambient Air, which works chiefly upon the Earth in the Spring and Autumn, with Thunder and Rain, or rather with the Sun,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:35070:194"/>after Rain. The ſame <hi>Licetus, Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Spont. Vivent. Ort. Cap.</hi> 5. conceives that the matter of Toad-ſtools is an aliment fit to nouriſh plants, falling upon the ground from the Carkaſſes either of other Plants or of Animals, which when the neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Plants do not draw to nouriſh themſelves, the Soul of its own accord turns it into Toad-ſtools and Puck-fiſts.</p>
                  <p>But in very deed, there is not only one kind of Toad-ſtools,
<note place="margin">The kinds of toad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtools or Muſhroms</note> as hereafter will appear when we ſpeak of their differences. Some grow to Trees, ſome Spring out of the Earth. The former proceeds from the Soul in the Body of the Tree, nuſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by reaſon of the unfitneſs of the matter it works upon, but not from the Soul weakned. And as in Man certain Toad-ſtools are bred, ſundry ſorts of Warts, Wens and other Excreſcences, by reaſon of Vitious Aliment, which Nature chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges into the beſt Form it can, and ſuch as the Nature of the place will bear: ſo alſo in Trees, eſpecially thoſe that are aged, when either vitious Aliment flows in, or in a weak part it is not well digeſted, Nature generates ſuch like Toad-ſtools. The reſt have their nouriſhment in the Earth, but not all that which <hi>Licetus</hi> would have. For if all that which <hi>Licetus</hi> would have were the immediate matter of Toad-ſtools, they would grow every where in Fields and Gardens; ſince there is ſuch matter in all places: which nevertheleſs doth not come to paſs. Nor hath it ever been obſerved, that Toad ſtools and Puck-fiſts were bred out of Animals; as for thoſe which are ſaid to breed upon men, they are only ſo called by way of ſimilitude.</p>
                  <p>And therefore I conceive it is more probable that Puck-fiſts do ariſe and grow on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon and out of Plants.
<note place="margin">All toad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtools or Muſhroms ariſe from Plants.</note> And that in the Earth they are generated out of the Roots and Barks of Trees and Shrubs, either Putrified and Corrupted, or ſending ſome Juyce out of themſelves, and conſequently of ſuch matter which was the proper and immediate ſubject of the Soul of the Plant, and contains in it a ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Form, which being afterwards ſtirred up by heat, and having got a fitting matter it turns to a Toad-ſtool to which it is Naturally diſpoſed. For when ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what is ſeparated and divided from the Tree, and is no longer governed by the Form of a plant, then that concealed Form is ſtired up by the moiſt Heat of the Earth about it, and begins to exerciſe the Function of a Soul, and of its ſubject matter being diſpoſed thereto it forms the Body of an imperfect or half Plant. Whence it is that after Thunder and Showers great ſtore of Toad-ſtools are wont to Spring up. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And becauſe Toad ſtools are ſpeedily Generated and grow up,
<note place="margin">Why toad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtools are ſo ſuddenly Generated.</note> 
                     <hi>Licetus</hi> holds <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Spont. Viv. Ort. Cap.</hi> 10. that there muſt needs come together at once ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch Atomes as are fit to Generate Toad ſtools, ſo as to make up a ſenſible bulk; becauſe the Soul of one Atome is ſo weak, that it cannot vivifie nor ſhape the matter of a Toad-ſtool, nor perform that which the Souls of many Atomes flowing together into one Body and becoming one, can do. But there is ſome doubt in this point. For wonderful, truely, is the Nature of Forms and Souls, which of it ſelf hath no quantity, and hath the ſame force in a ſmal Body which it hath in a great. Nor doth the bulk of a Toad-ſtool prove that which he ſaies; ſince we ſee of an exceeding ſmal Seed a great Plant doth ariſe, matter being drawn out of the Earth for the formation and Augmentation thereof. The moſt ſwift encreaſe of Toad-ſtools doth rather ſeem to perſwade what <hi>Licetus</hi> thinks; ſince it is not cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, that in ſo ſhort a ſpace of time a Soul lurking in ſo ſmal a Body can draw to it ſo great a quantity of matter. Unleſs any man will peradventure ſay, that the matter is prepared by little and little by the Soul of the Toad ſtool, and afterward it ſuddenly Springs up.</p>

                     <head>The Differences or Sorts of Muſhroms or Toad-ſtools, and of Puck-fiſts.</head>
                     <p>And although all Toad-ſtools do ariſe from plants, and the Roots, Branches,
<note place="margin">The differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of toadſtools.</note> Stocks, and Barks of Trees and ſhrubs: yet there is great difference amongſt them,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:35070:195"/>in regard of diverſity of their matter. For ſome grow to Trees and Wood, ſome grow under Trees and in the ground. Nor is it eaſie to find a Toad-ſtool where there is not or hath not been ſome Tree or Wood.
<note place="margin">The origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of toad ſtools which grow upon Trees.</note> And the matter, truly, of ſuch as grow upon Trees and Wood proceeds in the firſt place from the ſubſtance it ſelf of the Trees, or that matter which is the proper ſubject of the Soul of the Tree. But a Toad-ſtool is not made thereof, ſo long as it is under the dominion of the Soul of the Tree, or Shrub, but when it is deſerted thereby, and either the whole Plant, or ſome part thereof comes to die. And therefore we ſee that Toad-ſtools for the moſt part do not grow upon ſound and uncorruped Trees, but on ſuch as are old, and in ſome part decaied. Secondly, The vitious Aliment of the Tree or Shrub. Thirdly, ſome Excrement ſhed from the Tree or Bark; whence <hi>Pliny, Lib.</hi> 22. <hi>C.</hi> 23. writes that Toad-ſtools are bred of the Flegm of Trees. And indeed, it is credible that Toad-ſtools which grow on living Treees by means of the two laſt cauſes and manners are the works of the Soul it ſelf of the Tree. For like as, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what was formerly ſaid, Toad-ſtools and Warts are generated on the Body of Man, while Nature, which is never idle, turns and Forms the vitious and ſuperfluous Humor (which breaking through the Membranes and Pores, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not change into the ſubſtance of the part, by reaſon of the unfitneſs of the matter and the weakneſs of the part) into ſuch a ſubſtance; ſo credible it is, that the ſame doth happen in trees.</p>
                     <p>The matter of thoſe which Spring out of the Earth is either ſome part of a Root,
<note place="margin">Toadſtools Springing out of the Earth.</note> or a Bark, or ſome other part ſeparate from the Tree. And therefore where Toad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtools are bred, there for the moſt part you ſhal find the Barks and parts of Trees, which when they are corrupted and Rot, by Rain falling upon them they are cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Earth, and being cheriſhed with the Heat thereof are changed into Toad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtools.

And that this is ſo, not only when the ſticks are burnt, but alſo when they are not burnt, any one may eaſily try. For when I had uſed to manure my Garden with Earth that had ſmal fragments of ſticks mingled therewith, the ſecond year there grew up ſtore of ſmal Muſhroms or Toad-ſtools al about.</p>
                     <p>Again though no part of the Tree or Shrub be found evidently corrupted in the ground: yet of them Toad-ſtools are bred, when the Juyces or Excrements of Trees lie hid in the ground. For ſuch is the Nature of theſe more Ignoble Forms, that even in the ſmalleſt Atomes and Juyces they can remain intire, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards gaining a convenient place, and being ſtirred up by the heat of ſome Ambient Body, they rouze themſelves, and Form and ſhape the Body of a Toad-ſtool. For ſince a Soul can abide in the ſmalleſt Seeds of Plants, and when it gets place and matter it can Form a great Plant: why may not theſe Forms much more Ignoble be preſerved entire in the ſmal Bodies or Atomes of Plants?</p>
                     <p>Now the chief cauſe of the variety of Toad-ſtools is the diverſity of Trees and Shrubs from whence they ariſe;
<note place="margin">The varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Toad ſtools.</note> for ſome forts grow upon or under ſome kind of Trees or Shrubs, and ſome upon or under others. So, thoſe great and very white Toad-ſtools like a mans Skul, which Chirurgeons uſe to ſtop Blood, and are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Crepitus Lupi,</hi> do hardly grow any where but in Vineyards, and they grow out of Vine Branches dead and corrupted. Alſo the variety of the Parts themſelves of the Trees.</p>
                     <p>Howbeit, I am apt to believe that the variety of Toad-ſtools doth not only depend upon the diverſity of the matter which Trees afford them, but alſo upon
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:35070:195"/>the variety of matter which is otherwiſe found in the Earth. For ſeeing certain it is that all this great bulk of ſome Toad-ſtools doth not come from the Tree, doubtleſs the form or Soul communicated by the Tree doth in the Earth aſſociate ſuch matter as it meets with, and thereof frames to it ſelf a convenient Body; as alſo we ſee that ſmal Seeds do draw matter and aliment out of the Earth, and that thence great Plants grow up. And that the Soul of the Toad-ſtool doth ſnatch any Obvious matter, and thereof ſhape a Toad-ſtool, appears even hereby, that <hi>Pliny Lib.</hi> 19. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. writes: We know what hapned to <hi>Laertius Licinius</hi> a Pretorian, being Judg at <hi>Carthage</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> a few years ſince; who biting a Muſhrom had his fore Teeth looſned by a Braſs Farthing that was therein.</p>

                     <p>And ſince among other Toad-ſtools, both in regard of the ſhape and ſtrong ſmel, the <hi>Fungus Cervinus</hi> or Harts Toad-ſtool is remarkable, Now <hi>Matthiolus</hi> writes thereof, as of a thing by himſelf lately found out, <hi>Lib. 3. Epiſt. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lt. ad Julium Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratum</hi> in theſe words: ſeeing I know that you are much delighted with novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, I have ſent you with theſe my Letters a certain Subterranean Puck-fiſt, which the Bohemians cal Harts Muſhrom. For I conceive it is a thing you never heard of before, becauſe no Ancient nor late writers make any mention thereof; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not to be found, ſave in thoſe Woods where there are many Harts and Hunters, who know theſe ſecrets of Nature: but becauſe theſe things are unheard of in your parts, I will not have you any longer unacquainted with the Hiſtory and Virtue of this Toad-ſtool. Now Hunters relate that this Toad-ſtool after the manner of ordinary puck-fiſts grows under the ground, where the Earth is infected with the Harts Sperm falling thereupon. Which many times happens when the Male draws his Yard out of the Genitals of the Female containing Seed in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, by reaſon of the Females withdrawing her ſelf from the Violence of the Male. And perhaps no man could ever find this Toad-ſtool, did not the Harts themſelves at a certain ſeaſon of the year diſcover the place where they grow. For led by a Natural Inſtinct they ſcrape with their fore Feet upon the ground whereunder the ſaid Toad ſtool grows which they are ſaid to diſcern by the ſmel. For the Toad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool hath a very ſtrong ſmel, eſpecially when it is firſt dug up. Hunters and Country-men which are acquainted with the Secret and frequent the Woods dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently obſerve the places, being drawn by the Harts Feet, and digging the pit they take out the Toad-ſtools and ſel them to the Apothecaries, who cut them in pieces, draw them upon Threds, and dry them afterwards in the ſhadow, and keep them for Medicinal uſes. They are of the ſame ſhape (for the moſt part) which we ſee in other Puck-fiſts, yet all are round like Globes and uneven. The outmoſt thin Rind is ſwarthy ſomwhat, but the fleſhy <hi>Fungus</hi> ſubſtance is white. Some ſay there is a certain kind of theſe Puck-fiſts reſembling a mans Yard Erected, with the Nut un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and at the other end certain Knobs reſembling Teſticles. But that vulgar Opinion of the Hunts-Men touching the Original of theſe Toad-ſtools ſounds like a Fable, into which perhaps the ſtrong ſmel, and in the latter ſort the ſhape, might bring them.

At <hi>Trenzine</hi> a Famous town of <hi>Hungary</hi> about the Clifts of <hi>Carpathus</hi> they are very plentiful; in Mountanous places, and dark Woods, where though you may find Harts, yet is there not ſo great plenty, as to ſuffice for the Generation of Wain-Loads of theſe Puck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſts, if that were to be thought true which is related of their Generation. Alſo I have as touching the latter kind been brought into a ſuſpition by what I obſerved here at <hi>Wittenberge,</hi> in the year 1626. For the Trench being to be repaired and the City to be fortified, the Captain of the Garriſon walking accidentally in the Ditch, drawn by the ſmel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he found one of theſe Puck-ſiſts having the form of a Mans Yard, and wondering (for he had from Hunters drunk in the foreſaid Opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Original thereof) how in a place where no Hart had been this Toad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool could be Generated, he brought me to the place, and being ſome ſpaces diſtant I alſo perceived that ſame exceeding ſtrong ſmel proper to this kind, and under an

<note place="margin">What kind of Stones they are out of which Muſheoms grow.</note> foraſmuch as the ſaid <hi>Licetus,</hi> in the place cited, relates, that he ſaw at <hi>Padua,</hi> in the Garden of <hi>Benedictus Sylvaticus</hi> a Famous Phyſitian, three ſuch Muſhroms bearing Stones, ſent him from the Country of <hi>Naples,</hi> and that he did Eat Muſhroms which grew upon them; and adds, that thoſe Stones were very ſoft, yielding to the touch, ſo that they ſeemed rather pieces of Wood then Stones; we may juſtly conclude, that Muſhroms never grow out of true Stones, but that theſe Neapolitan Stones ſo accounted are pieces of wood, by a Stone-making Juyce hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into the Similitude of Stones; or as <hi>Licetus</hi> would have it, that theſe Stones had their original from Earth, which being ful of the parts and Juyces of Plants was by a ſtone making juyce hardned.

                  <head>Chap. <hi>7. Of Plants which grow up of themſelves.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>NOW ſeveral Men are of ſeveral minds as concerning the manner how Plants come to grow of their own accord.
<note place="margin">Plants, how they grow up of themſelves</note> Some follow the Opinion of <hi>Eraſtus</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. and hold, that every Earth is endued with a peculiar faculty of producing Peculiar Plants, or that it hath a Seminal power communicated by the bleſſing of God at the firſt Creation, which is brought into act by the Sun and influx of the Stars. And they are induced ſo to think, becauſe, if Earth digged out of the deepeſt Pit or Well be placed upon the higheſt turret, it produces Plants. And <hi>Johannes Baptiſt. Port.</hi> writes <hi>Lib. 2. Phytognom. Cap.</hi> 1. That when he had gotten Earth out of the deepeſt Cellars of certain Houſes, that there might be no ſuſpition of Seed, and had ſet it in the open Air on the top of his Houſe, leſt the wind ſhould bring ſeeds into it from elſewhere, not many daies after out of the ſeveral ſorts of Earth in ſo many baskets ſeveral kinds of Plants Sprung up, but ſuch as uſually grow in the Neapolitan Soil. For clayiſh ground did bring forth one ſort, the <hi>Pateolan</hi> Mould another, gravelly Earth another. And <hi>Porta</hi> adds that in the Iſland of <hi>Crete,</hi> whitherſoever a man carry the Earth, unleſs ſomwhat elſe be ſowed therein, it preſently brings forth Cypreſs. And moſt certain it is, that in Fields and Meadows ſome Plants are Natural to one Field or Meadow, ſome to another. Which Opinion if any man will follow, I ſhall not quarrel with him. Yet theſe doubts occur in this Opinion: firſt, that God did once command the Earth, at the Creation, to produce Plants, and it was accordingly done: And he bleſſed the Plants, and commanded them to produce their Seeds, whereby they might multiply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but he did not bleſs the Earth. Which doubt whether it can be anſwered by ſaying, that it is not to be underſtood of ſimple Earth, but of the kinds of Earth, of which Queſtionleſs there are many, and they mixt Bodies, and that theſe mixt Earths have a Seminal faculty put into them by the Creator whereby they produce Plants; I leave to the Judgment of the Reader. St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſeems to incline to this Opinion, who in <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Hexamer.</hi> Writes thus concerning this matter: <hi>That firſt word of God whereby he created all Creatures, is the Law of Nature, which hath continued ever ſince in the Earth, giving a rule to Future ſucceſſion.</hi> Another doubt is, that this Earth doth not bring forth Plants before it is moiſtened with Rain. So that the Seminal Virtue may ſeem rather to be communicated thereto by Showers of Rain, then to be Naturally implanted therein.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe, indeed,
<note place="margin">The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Spontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Plant</note> that this is one manner of the Spontaneous Generation of Plants; Yet is it not the only manner: but that oftentimes Seed is communicated from elſewhere to an Earth of it ſelf barren, appears even hereby, in that it hath been obſerved that after Rains and inundations of Water new Plants have ſprung up in certain places. But how this comes to paſs, is not very apparent. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that all this Spontaneous Generation of Plants, may be reduced to thoſe two manners, which I formerly propounded in General. For ſome plants although they are not Generated of Seed manifeſt to our ſenſes, nor ſpring from branches ſet in the Earth, yet they really proceed from another Plant of the ſame ſort, and from the Seed thereof; which although it be not in a viſible Body, yet is it in the ſmalleſt Particles or Atomes containing the Soul of the ſame ſort, which Particles may lie concealed in Rain or in the ground; whoſe Soul having afterwards gained a fit place, and being provoked by the heat of the Ambient Air, it diſplaies it ſelf. <hi>Licetus</hi> indeed. <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Spont. Vivent. Ort. Cap.</hi> 13.
<note place="margin">Whether Atomes containing the Soul may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Seed</note> doth grant that theſe Atomes perform the Office of Seed, and anſwer to Seed by way of proportion, but he denies that they are really ſeed: but I ſee no cauſe why he ſhould do ſo, unleſs peradventure inaſmuch as this Seed hath no external Figure as other Seeds have; meanwhile it may wel be called a Seminal Principle. For an external Figure and a certain man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Formation doth nor primarily conſtitute Seed, but the Soul lying hid in the ſame with that ſame implanted Spirit which is ſaid to anſwer to the Element of
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:35070:197"/>the Stars, and makes the Seeds fruitful: which becauſe they with their ſubject may be in the ſmalleſt Atomes, there is no cauſe why they may not be called a peculiar ſort of Seeds, or a Seminal Principle. And although the Soul which lies hid in ſuch ſmal Bodies or Atomes doth not inform the Earth or Water wherein it is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but lies therein concealed as in a Veſſel; yet thoſe little Bodies it informs wherein it is as its proper ſubject, and is in them according to its firſt Act, and it then comes to its Second Act when it hath got a convenient place.</p>
                  <p>But other Plants are more properly ſaid to be Spontaneouſly Generated, when they proceed not from a Seed or Soul of the ſame ſort, but from that Form which in a more noble Plant was inſtead of the next matter, and the ſubject of its ſpecifical Soul, juſt as Toad-ſtools (whereof we treated in the former Chapter) and moſs do grow upon Trees.</p>
                  <p>Now Moſs grows upon ſundry Trees, as on the Cedar, Poplar, Oak, and Pitch-Tree, from which in the Mountains of the Valley of <hi>Anania</hi> above Trent,

                     <hi>Matthio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> ſaies he had frequently gathered very long Hairy moſs, much ſweeter and fairer then that which grows upon the Poplar and Oak, <hi>in</hi> 1 <hi>Dioſcorid. C.</hi> 20. Yea, and there is hardly any Tree but when it is old it bears Moſs, and it is a token of a Trees being Old, when it begins to be covered with Moſs. Alſo <hi>Fab. Columna</hi> hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed ſundry ſorts of Moſs, <hi>Minus Cognitar. Stirp. Lib.</hi> 10. <hi>Cap.</hi> 158, 159, 160.</p>
                  <p>To Moſſes belong the kinds of Liver-wort, which although, as <hi>Dioſcorides Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 48. writes, it grows familiarly on Stones, as on Rocks, the Stones of Wells, the Tiles of Houſes: yet the ſame <hi>Fabius Columna</hi> tels us they grow alſo upon the ſtumps of Trees, in moiſt and Champian Countries eſpecially, in the foreſaid Book, <hi>Cap.</hi> 154. Yea in our Countries alſo that ſame kind of Moſs which they cal Tree-lung-wort doth grow upon Trees.</p>
                  <p>Nor muſt we here paſs over that ſingular Opinion of <hi>Fortunius Licetus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Plants out of dried Plants.</note> which will ſeem a Paradox to ſome, touching the Generation of Plants out of dried Plants, which are commonly thought to be dead and void of all Soul. We have in Gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, indeed, ſpoken ſomwhat hereof before: yet I think fit more Particularly in this place to repeat the ſaid Queſtion, and more clearly to explain the ſame. Now <hi>Fortunius Licetus</hi> is of this Opinion, that the ſame Soul which did conſtitute the Living Creature doth remain in the dead Carkaſs, but doth not inform the ſame: Yet that it doth again rouze it ſelf, and is able again to perform the Office of a Form; and that two manner of Waies. For ſomtimes the ſame Soul (he ſaies) being decaied and weakned doth procreate imperfect things: and ſomtimes again, as he ſhews <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de his qui diu ſine Alimentis Vivunt, Cap. 7.</hi> out of the Body which is accounted for dead a new plant is produced. Foraſmuch as Plants pluckt up out of the Earth, or broken off from their Roots or trunks, do not preſently die, only being deſtitute of a fit place out of which they may draw Aliment they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not grow, and they ceaſe bearing branches, leaves, and Fruits; yet in the mean time the ſelf ſame Soul doth Vegetate that Body: as ſeeds that are kept in the Winter time ſhew no other ſign of a Soul in them, but that their Body is thereby kept alive; whence it is, that the ſaid ſeed is fit to be ſown and to be uſed in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick: but when it is no more animated but corrupted, it becomes both unfit to be ſown, and loſes all its vertue in Phyſick: If the Wood of an Olive (ſaies he) be ſimply dry, it will live no longer; ſince life conſiſts in moiſture, and dryneſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is the Death of Plants; but there wil be the Carkaſs of an Olive-Tree, wherein with ſome degree of Heat, and ſome Foot-ſteps of the former temper, (if the Soul be yet contained in it as in a Veſſel; not quickening the Wood) when it is digged up and hath gained a fitting heat for life from the Ambient Air, and like its former temperament, then it becomes fit for the Soul again therein as the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting Form of an Olive Tree to ſhew it ſelf:
<note place="margin">A dry alive ſtock wil ſprout againe.</note> but if the Olive Wood were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly dry, but ſtill had life in it, it would ſprout of it ſelf, and produce an Olive Tree, by a non-Spontaneous Generation. Now this chiefly brought him into that Opinion, in that Woods do laſt many Years and preſerve their ſtrength. Yea, and which is ſtrange, it hath been obſerved that they have ſprouted the Second time and performed the operations of the Soul. Of Which <hi>Virgil,</hi> 2 <hi>Georgic.</hi>

                  <p>Which Verſe although ſome interpret concerning ingrafting: yet they do it contrary to the mind of <hi>Virgil,</hi> who treats of ingrafting in the verſe following. And why ſhould that be counted a wonder? But <hi>Servius</hi> hath rightly interpreted this Verſe. That (ſaith he) which is here ſaid is true of the Olive and Myrtle, whoſe dry ſtocks are cut to the middle or pith, and ſo put under ground, and from them Trees do ſhoot forth, which is ſtrange indeed. <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> taught the ſame thing <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Cauſ. Plant. Cap</hi> 4. who writes, that in an ordinanry courſe of Nature the dry wood of an Olive Tree will ſprout again. For thoſe Woods alſo, ſaith he, which ſprout of their own accord, as the Olive-Tree-Wood, and all ſuch like, which they reckon for Miracles and Wonders, have their Reaſon in Nature. For they are Naturally long lived and apt to ſprout, becauſe of their thickneſs and moiſture, and therefore as ſoon as they are ſenſible of any Liquor from without, preſently they ſend forth branches. In very deed, for the moſt part Wood covered with Earth and laid in moiſt places doth Sprout; beſides that, a bough cut off hath been ſeen to ſhoot forth Twigs ſoon after, becauſe it had in it moiſture enough, and the Spring was at Hand, the like whereof happens to the Squil or Sea-Onion, and ſuch other Plants as Sprout after they are hanged up in the Houſe. And the ſaid <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> in <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>de Hiſt. Plant. Cap.</hi> 10. writes, that the Wood of the Olive Tree doth above all other Woods Sprout and ſend forth Twigs, both rude, or rough and when it is wrought into ſome work, if it be ſenſible of any moyſture and have attained a moiſt place, ſo that a part of a folding door hath been ſaid to Sprout, and a wooden Cup which fel into the Dirt. So, credible Authors relate that <hi>Hercules</hi> his Club which was made of Olive-Tree-Wood did Sprout.
<note place="margin">Hercules his Club did ſprous.</note> And <hi>Fortunius Licetus,</hi> in the place fore alleadged <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de his qui diu vivunt fine Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento, Cap.</hi> 7. writes that he ſaw at <hi>Rechum</hi> in the Garden of his Unkle <hi>Bartholomew Licetus,</hi> the ſtock of an Olive Tree which had been Planted, and was now near dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up and had been Naked ten years together, and of it ſelf ſeparated from the Trunk, and never after that Planted in the Earth; which being thruſt into the ground near a Wel to prop up ſome other Wood, and Nailed to the Wood which it bore up with Iron Nailes, it budded and branched many Olive branches laden with Leaves and Fruit, and afterwards bare in like manner, many years. <hi>Johannes Ludovicus de la Cerda</hi> confirms the ſame, who, upon that Verſe of <hi>Virgil</hi> aforeſaid, commenting, thus writes: the Eyes of many moſt skilful Husband-men have been witneſſes, of whom I made enquiry: the Art it ſelf is a Witneſs, which is now much in requeſt in <hi>Spain,</hi> where at preſent I live. The Husbandmen cut the ſtock of an Olive Tree (whoſe Root and branches are taken away) into many parcels, and ſo they bury it in the ground, which forms firſt a Root and then a Tree, which <hi>Virgil</hi> wonders at; for it is really a wonderful thing.</p>
                  <p>Other Trees alſo beſides the Olive have been obſerved to do as much. Yea <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> himſelf grants, 2. <hi>Phyſ. Cap.</hi> 1.

                  <p> The premiſes therefore being ſuch, and confirmed by the Teſtimony of moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, Yea, by experience it ſelf, upon which the Judgment of <hi>Licetus</hi> is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, although his Opinion ſeem Paradoxical, yet it is not ſimply to be rejected, but to be dextrouſly explained and limited.
<note place="margin">All Plants do not die as ſoon as they are pluckt out of the Earth.</note> This in the firſt place is certain; that all Plants pluckt up out of the ground do not preſently die, as may be ſeen in the Squil and the American <hi>Sempervivum.</hi> But that all Plants pluckt up out of the Earth and dried ſhould retain their Souls and live, and that only nutrition in ſome ſort ceaſes in them, this cannot eaſily be granted, eſpecially if the Root being cut off, and the bark taken away, they be cut in pieces. Much leſs can it be granted, that the Carkaſſes of Animals do retain their former Soul. For every Soul requires its proper ſubject, <hi>viz.</hi> Innate Heat, conſiſting of the implanted and influent heat, in Animals; but in Plants, likewiſe, a temperament ſo and ſo diſpoſed, which becauſe in dried Plants it is changed, ſo they come alſo to loſe their Life.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe the former experience cannot be denied,
<note place="margin">Which way a dry Olive tree may come to ſprout a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</note> we are now to enqure how it hath and may come to paſs, that the Wood of a dry Olive Tree ſhould Sprout again. Which though it be hard to find out, yet becauſe it is not Miraculous but Natural, I will propound my Opinion: let every man follow what Opinion he likes beſt. And in the firſt place, this muſt be remembred, as hath been many times ſaid before,
<note place="margin">Sundry waies of the Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Plants.</note> that there is not one manner of the Propagation of Plants. For all Plants are not propagated by Seed formed after a certain faſhion, and included in one part, but that ſame juyce containing in it the Seminal principle is in many d<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>p or branch puld off, or by their Roots, and ſo multiply themſelves; and after this manner the Seminal faculty communicated either from Seed properly ſo called, or from a Root, or any other way from a Plant of the ſame ſort, may many times lie long hidden. <hi>Jul. Caeſar Scaliger</hi> relates, that the Seed of Bears-Foot hath thus lain hid in the Earth eight years together, <hi>Exercitat.</hi> 140. In my little Garden (ſaith he) which is next my ſtudy, I planted Bears-Foot, I kept it a long time diligently. Some Thieviſh Herb gatherers, from whom nothing can be kept, had to my think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pluckt it all away by the Roots. For above eight years there was no appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance therof. A Berberry was ſet near that place. The place it ſelf was digged and rak't, and ſowed with patience Seed, which they here falſly count to be <hi>Raved.</hi> The Patience grew and fild the bed and was gathered. I falling ſick, that plat lay waſt and was not ſtirred for three years together. This preſent year I find the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of my Bears-Foot, <hi>viz.</hi> two Plants with moſt beautiful neat leaves, a large ſtalk and fairly flowred. And therefore as in Wheat, Barley, Oates, and other dead Plants, the Seed may remain in the ſtraw ſhut up in its Chaffie caſes: ſo alſo, that ſame juyce containing the Seminal Principle, diffuſed through the whole Plant, may in ſome Plants dead and dried laſt for a ſeaſon. And as (nevertheleſs) he ſhould not ſay truly who ſhould ſay that dried Oats or dried Wheat in the barn doth live, although in the dried ſtraw a living Seed is contained: ſo alſo it muſt not be ſaid that the foreſaid wood doth live, but only that it containes in it ſelf a Seminal principle. Yet few Plants once dried do recover that ſame Ancient Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal diſpoſition which was neceſſary to the exerciſe of the Second Act. That it ſomtimes ſo happens in the Olive Tree hath been obſerved, ſince it above all others abounds with that ſame Fat Balſamick Juyce. That the ſame hath hapned in an Aſh and Poplar hath been ſaid before.
<note place="margin">Herbs that Root, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive again</note> But that Herbs after they are rotten and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted may revive again, daily experience ſhews, while in Fields and Gardens manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Dung thoſe Plants which have putrified in the Dung are Generated, the Juyce which contains the Seminal principle having remained unhurt. And al Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band-men know,

And al theſe things although they ſeem wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and almoſt incredible: yet that they are true appears even hereby, in that alſo of the Tears and Gums of Plants Plants are generated, as ſhall be ſaid hereafter.</p>
                  <p>But although theſe things are true of Plants:
<note place="margin">The Souls of Brutes Mortal.</note> yet the Souls of perfect brute Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals cannot ſurvive after Death. And whereas out of the Carkaſſes of Animals ſuch Ignoble petty Animals are bred as aforeſaid, that doth not happen becauſe the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:35070:198"/>Soul of the Animal remaining the ſame being reduced to a more Ignoble degree does produce worms (for the Soul of a Man, a Lyon, an Ox, doth not go into ſuch Animals) but becauſe the ſubordinate Form lying hid doth then rowze it ſelf up, as was ſaid before.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, after both the manners before propounded ſundry Plants do Sponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly ariſe. For in the firſt place, out of the Ground although never ſowed with any Seed ſome Plants do ſpring up of themſelves, as <hi>Virgil</hi> ſaid of Trees.

                  <p>Now this doth nor only happen when (which belongs not to this place) the Seeds themſelves intire are carried by force of Winds or overflowings of Waters into ſome other place; but alſo when thoſe little Bodies containing ſeed in them are carried thither either by Winds, Rain, or inundations of Water, or when ſome Plant of the ſame kind hath putrified in that place, and yet hath there left its Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal rudiments.

                  <p>Hither may be referred the degeneration of Plants,

But it never ſprung up according to the uſual manner: but another Plant quite different therefrom, to my admiration. It was that which the more learned call <hi>Scorodotis</hi> and hath been hitherto falſly taken to be <hi>Scordium</hi> by many. Its leaves when it is yong (if you look on it at a diſtance) are like Violet Leaves, it hath a white flower, with the Smel and Taſt of Garlick. <hi>[This ſhould be that we call Jack by the Hedg, or ſawce alone, and our Herbals All<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

We ſpake before of Bears-Foot from <hi>Scaliger, in the place lately cited,</hi> how that when he thought it
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:35070:199"/>was Rooted al up, and had not appeared for about eleven years, at length it ſprung up again.</p>
                  <p>Now how this degeneration comes to paſs is doubtful:
<note place="margin">How it comes to paſs.</note> 
                     <hi>Fortunius Licetus,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Spont. Viv. Ort. Cap.</hi> 35. and elſewhere, holds that Forms do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo degenerate whiles they are weakned, and through weakneſs come to degenerate into weaker Forms. Now he writes that they are weakned, either by a contrary agent working upon them by it ſelf; or upon the mutation of the ſubject upon which they depend as to their Eſſence; or from both cauſes together. So the Soul of a Calf when it dies degenerates into the Souls of Worms and Bees, which Spontaneouſly breed out of the Carkaſs thereof; ſo the Eſſence of Wheat is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into the ſubſtance of Darnel and Oates; ſo heat Fainting away degenerates in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Luke-warmneſs, ſo that not only the Forms of the ſubſtances but of the accidents alſo are changed, as he writes. But as was ſaid before, this degeneration of forms, ſo that the form of a calf ſhould degenerate into the form of worms, is not agreeable to Reaſon. Rather there is a certain kndred of Forms, as <hi>Matthiolus</hi> ſpeaks in his preface upon <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> and ſome Seeds are Equivocal, that is, common as it were to divers ſorts. And as the fame internal Form Bears one while the Form of a Palmer Worm, another while of a Butter Fly, another while of another Worm, and then of a Silk Worm: ſo alſo in Plants, ſome Souls are ſo conſtituted, that, according to the diſpoſition of the matter they may form now this, now that ſhape of Body; or they are ſo ſubordinate that one is Lady and the other a Servant, and the Lady exerciſes her Soveraignty ſo long as the matter of which the Plant is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and nouriſhed is wel diſpoſed; but when there is any deficiency therein, the Hand Maid takes the Soveraignty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> diſputes whether Plants degenerate in the Seed or in the Root,
<note place="margin">The Dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of plants where cauſed.</note> 4. <hi>de Cauſ. Plant. Cap.</hi> 6. and denies that it is made in the Root, becauſe the Nature of the ſtalk, Leaves and Seed, do alwaies follow the Nature of the Root; and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes that it is made in the Seed, and that it grows fruit leſs either through penury or ſuperfluity of nouriſhment. <hi>Johan. Gallego de la Serna de Princ. Generat. Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 7. conceives that theſe degenerations of plants may happen two manner of waies, either becauſe the Soul of the Seed weakned by faultineſs of the matter could not produce its proper iſſue, and bred a monſter, as happens in Animals; or becauſe the form of Wheat, for example, is quite corrupted, and upon the corruption the matter remains ſo diſpoſed, that by the univerſal cauſe the form of Darnel or Spelt may forthwith be produced in it. But neither of theſe waies may be ſimply allowed. For, as to the firſt, this is true, that through fault of the matter the Soul cannot produce that which it is ordinarily accuſtomed to do, otherwiſe. Yet that Body which it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces is not alwaies a monſter. And the generation of Monſters is ried to no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rules. But the degeneration of Plants is made certain waies, and ſuch Plants degenerate into ſuch and no other, or not into any at leaſt. But the ſecond manner is abſolutely falſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Soul is corrupted, and from the diſpoſition of the matter remaining the univerſal Cauſe produces another. For the Univerſal cauſe doth not produce any ſpecifical effect. And he acknowledges, that the ſaid effect is not indefinite and indeterminate, and that of Wheat Turnep or Cole-wort is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made, but only Darnel or Spelt. As alſo of the Carkaſſes of Animals only ſome ſorts of Animals ariſe, and not any whatſoever. This therefore is more likely, that the Creator hath given to thoſe forms the faculty to ſhape themſelves ſundry Bodies; ſo that when the matter is rightly diſpoſed it makes ſome kind of Bodies; and ſo of Wheat grows commonly Wheat, but when the matter is ill diſpoſed, yet that Nature may not be idle it hath the power to produce another Body; for examples ſake, when the Soul of Wheat hath matter indiſpoſed, it makes the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Darnel or Spelt. And it is here much after the ſame manner as was ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concerning Palmer Worms and Butter-flies, where the ſame form at ſundry times makes ſundry Bodies. And that the Soul doth not periſh appears even hereby, in that after Spelt is ſprung form Wheat, black Oates from white, if it find again a convenient ſoil it will return to Wheat and white Oates again.</p>
                  <p>And although all Spontaneous Generation of Plants may be reduced to theſe two manners, whether it be properly or improperly ſo called: yet that the thing may be more Plain, I think fit to explain this buſineſs according to the matter and ſubjects in which theſe Plants Spontaneouſly ariſe.</p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:35070:199"/>
                  <p> Secondly therefore,
<note place="margin">Plants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from dung.</note> what hath been newly ſaid of the Earth is much more true of Dung; ſince therein lie hid and Jumbled together the Seeds, parts and juyces of ſundry Plants, and other things, and al the cauſes of Spontaneous Generation in the Earth may be found much more in Dung.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That many Plants Spring up in the Waters, Duck-weeds,
<note place="margin">Plants breeding in the waters</note> Water-Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, Water Caltrops, and many others, is moſt notoriouſly known. Now ſuch Plants are not all of them Spontaneouſly Generated (to ſpeak properly) but the Roots of ſome are divided out of which new ones ſpring up, others ſheed the Seed which they generate into the Waters, whereof Plants of the ſame ſort are bred, and the Seeds of Plants by the Wind and Inundations of Waters are brought in from other places. But thoſe which are ſo Spontaneouſly bred that they ſpring not from intire Seed, are Generated either from Plants putrefying in the Waters, or from Atomes or ſmal Bodies having Souls in them, falling into the Water in Rain ſhowers; which may alſo be cauſed by the Winds, when they blow into the Water amongſt the Duſt ſuch petty ſmal Bodies containing the Souls of Plants in them; or becauſe from the Roots of Trees ſome Juyce or Excrement containing in it a Seminal principle is ſhed into the Water. For by all theſe manner of waies thoſe petty Bodies containing the Souls of Plants, or at leaſt their forms which will turn to Souls when they meet with fit matter in the Water, (which chiefly comes to paſs in ſtanding Waters) and are cheriſhed by the ambient heat; they are rouzed up, and generate ſuch a plant as they are Naturally fitted for.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Some hold that Plants are alſo bred out of the Snow.
<note place="margin">Plants out of Snow.</note> But more credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it is, they grow under the Snow. For although it may come to paſs, though ſeldom, (for that cannot eaſily happen in Snow which happens in Rain) that pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Bodies (with the rudiments of Plants in them) may deſcend with the Snow: yet the heat by which they might be brought into act is wanting therein, and therefore very ſeldom or never, if by chance the Snow begin to be warmed and Melt with the heat of the Sun, or if that part of the Snow eſpecially being deep which is next the Earth do begin to be warm through hot Exhalations Springing out of the Earth, and the Soul lurking there be rouzed up and brought into act, Plants are bred out of the Snow.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, 'Tis alſo found that ſome Plants grow upon other plants. So,
<note place="margin">Plants growing upon other plants.</note> many times, upon Willows great Celandine, Bitter-ſweet and ſomtimes Elder doth grow, yea and Services and other Plants. Which happens, either becauſe whole Seeds are brought thither by the Winds (which yet is not Spontaneous Generation properly ſo called) or ſmal Bodies containing in them the Seed of Plants are brought by the Rain or Wind. Now this happens chiefly in thoſe Trees in which part of the Tree begins to Rot, and turn to duſt as it were: which often happens in old Willows cut off about the Head as they cal it. For ſince there is found matter fit to Form and Augment a Plant, the Soul of a Plant can eaſily diſplay it ſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. And therefore in ſuch Generations the Tree which grows in the Earth affords only a place to the Plant which grows upon it.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, 'Tis alſo very wel known that Plants do grow upon Rocks and Stones,
<note place="margin">Plants growing on Rocks. Whether Corals grow ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly.</note> as a kind of Moſs doth every where grow upon Stones, and Coral grows out of Sticks upon Rocks in the Sea, and Sea-Moſs grows upon Rocks and upon Shell-Fiſhes. But I doubt whether Corals do grow of their own accord. For although no Body Plants it in the Sea: yet becauſe it is a certain ſort of Natural thing, which is no where elſe Found ſave on the Rocks of the Sea, (nor can it be ſaid to grow from the Corruption of any other Plant or Animal;) this doubtleſs is its Natural place, and it was doubtleſs created upon theſe Rocks at the firſt Creation, on which it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated, either by Roots or by ſome juyce containing in it the principles of this Plant. But as to other plants, they grow upon ſtones, when ſhowers fal upon them, which contain either petty Bodies with the Forms of plants in them, or ſmal Bodies ſeparated by the corruption of other plants, yet fit to produce plants. And this happens more eaſily, if upon the Rains any Clay or Earth ſtick upon the ſaid Stones. For then thoſe Seeds find a more convenient place to diſplay themſelves. The ſame alſo may happen by the Excrements of Birds falling upon the Stones; ſince alſo in thoſe very Excrements the Forms of plants may remain unchanged. But it oft fals out, that not perfect Plants, but only ſome Moſs grows on Stones. For ſince by Reaſon of defect of Aliment that ſame Soul cannot make what it
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:35070:200"/>would, it makes what it can, and rather then be out of employment it frames Moſs.</p>
                  <p>And whereas Plants ſeem to grow ſomtimes, not only on the ſurface of Stones, but alſo to ſpring out of the depth of them; the cauſe (doubtleſs) is, that thoſe Stones have Clifts not diſcernable by our Eye-ſight, into which thoſe petty Bodies or Atomes, containing in them the form of a Plant do inſinuate themſelves with the Rain, which Form being wakened by the Heat of the Ambient Aire doth at laſt rouze it ſelf up and fall to work.</p>
                  <p>And whereas Plants do ſomtimes grow out of Brick or Stone Walls Joyned with Mortar, Yea, and Shrubs and Trees; it is no wonder. For their Original is the ſame with Plants that grow out of the Earth, when as either in the Sand which is mixed in the Mortar the Seed of ſome Plant is mixed, or is brought thither by Birds, or by the force of Winds, and inſinuates it ſelf into the chinks of the Walls (which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs is not Spontaneous Generation properly ſo called) or when with the Excrements of Birds or Rain petty Bodies containing in them the form of Plants are brought thither, and creep into the Chinks, and ſo in time Sptout forth.</p>
                  <p>Alſo <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> teaches,
<note place="margin">Plants from the tears of plants.</note> 
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Cauſis Plant. Cap.</hi> 4. that Plants do alſo grow out of the Tears and Gums of Plants. Which Generation although <hi>Licetus</hi> ſaies it is Spontaneous, <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Spont. Viv. Ort. Cap.</hi> 25. yet I had rather hold that this is no Spontaneous Original; ſince they are produced in a manner of Seeds, and that of the ſame ſort; and <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> himſelf ſaies, that the Generation from Tears doth plainly anſwer to that which proceeds from ſtalks; which queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs is not Spontaneous. And he teaches that there is a fruitful principle in the Tears, when he writes: But that is a moſt peculiar way of Generation which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from Tears, as that of Horſe-ſmallage, Lillies and ſome other Plants. Nor is a Reaſon wanting, but this plainly anſwers to Stalks. For the tears have in them a fruitful principle, and that is al the cauſe. And whereas <hi>Licetus</hi> holds a threefold fruitful principle, <hi>viz.</hi> Seed, a bodily part of the plant, as a Root, or ſtalk, and the Soul, he is out. For he doth ill to ad the Soul, as a different manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation from the others; ſince all propagation is made by the Soul, and the ſoul is never propagated without the Body. And whereas he propounds the ſubjects or Bodies wherein the Soul is, and by which it is propagated, to be the Seed, and Root, and Stalk, he errs therein alſo. For the Soul may alſo be in the Tears them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which <hi>Julius Caeſar Scaliger</hi> cauſeleſly oppoſes, when upon the forecited place of <hi>Theophraſtus,</hi> he writes, if of a Gum ſowed a plant is bred, the Gum cannot be the excrement but muſt be a part of the plant, wherein there is a vigorous generative principle. For all know that the word Excrement is taken equivocally when it is attributed to the Dung of the Belly, Urin, and other Excrements properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and afterwards to the Seed. But as <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> hints, al plants wil not ſpring from Tears, but only ſome certain kinds.</p>
                  <p>But thoſe plants which ſpring from plants of a different ſort are properly ſaid to grow of themſelves.
<note place="margin">Plants from plants of a ſeveral ſort.</note> So ſundry ſorts of Moſs do grow upon trees. So Miſſelto grows upon the Oake, the Hazel, the Apple-Tree, Pear-Tree, plum-tree, Birch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, but grows no where by it ſelf. That other Herbs and Shrubs grow upon trees, as hath been ſaid, is not unknown. But that is not Spontaneous Generation; ſince they grow not out of the Trees, but only upon the Trees, from their own Seeds, and the Tree which ſticks in the Earth doth only afford the place; which chiefly, comes to paſs when ſome part thereof is putrified and turnd to Earth as it were, whereof we have already ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Licetus</hi> propounds four manner of waies whereby plants of a different ſcart are bred of other plants,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The four manners of</hi> Licetus.</note> 
                     <hi>de Spont. Viv. Ort. Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 27. two Spontaneous and two non-Spontaneous. The firſt he makes to be, when the Soul of an old plant in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome waies within it ſelf procreates a new Soul different from it ſelf, which conſtitutes a new plant of a different ſort, and leſs perfect then it ſelf. The ſecond is, when the ſeed of any plant doth any waies fall upon another plant. Of which ſecond manner there is no doubt, but the firſt can hardly be allowed. Nor is it credible that a Soul ſhould procreate another Soul different from it ſelf. More likely it is that the generation of a new and different plant doth proceed from a
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:35070:200"/>ſubordinate form; as hath been ſaid concerning Worms bred out of plants. But that manner is properly Spontaneous.</p>
                  <p>The Third manner, and that not Spontaneous, he makes to be; when in the chinks and paſſages of an old Plant the pouder of Animals and Plants containing in it the Soul, as in a Veſſel, are by the heat of the Ambient Air diſpoſed to life. But, ſince thoſe pouders do contain in them a Seminal principle, we have formerly ſhewed in what ſence this generation cauſed by them is Spontaneous. For Moſs doth not belong to this manner of Generation, as he imagins with <hi>Coſtaeus.</hi> For Moſs is not made of the poudery matter of Moſs caſt upon the Trees from elſwhere, but out of the barks themſelves of Trees when they now begin to be corrupted, as was ſaid before.</p>
                  <p>The fourth manner is, when ſundry Excrements of an old Plant, (the former Soul that had Animated the ſame being put off by Death, but yet contained in them as in a Veſſel) when they come by the heat of the Ambient Air to be digeſted they are diſpoſed to a new life, and take to themſelves again the weakned Soul, degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from its old ſpecies or ſort, ſo as to become a new vivifying Form, conſtituting a new Plant.</p>
                  <p>Peculiarly, as to what concernes the Generation of Miſſleto,
<note place="margin">The gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Bird-lime.</note> 
                     <hi>Julius Caeſ. Scaliger</hi> treats largely thereof <hi>Exercit.</hi> 168. where firſt he relates the Opinion of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, imagining, that the Berries of Miſſleto being Eaten by Thruſhes, the pulp ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is concocted; but the Seed comes away indigeſted with the dung, and fals on the boughs of thoſe Trees whereon the Thruſhes are wont to ſettle. But he conceives this Opinion is therefore to be rejected, becauſe it is not any where planted or ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor grows upon every ſort of Tree, nor is it credible the Seed can enter into the hardeſt boughs ſo as to cleave the Bark, and become one with them without any Roots; that it proceeds out of ſome branches where no dung could ever reſt nor no Seed ſtick; nor could he ever find any grains of Miſſelto in the Crops or Guts of Thruſhes, having nouriſhed them with the berries thereof on purpoſe, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward cut them up. But he holds, that as horns (as it were) grow out of the Bones of Animals, ſo Miſſleto grows out of Trees, and that the unſhaped principles of Miſſleto being cheriſhed by the inward heat, aſſiſted by the outward, in a Juyce con-natural thereto, it grows into this Plant. And therefore there is one Wood of both, nor is the Miſſleto inſerted into the bough of the Tree like a Pant thruſt into the Earth. Which Opinion is ſo far true, as it holds that the principle of the Miſſle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to is in the Trees on which which it grows, and doth not come from without, but is Generated within the ſame, and proceeds from ſuperfluous matter, as horns in Animals. Yet herein is a difference, in that Miſſleto is not bred on all ſuch Trees, as all Animals of the ſame ſort bear horns, but on ſome Particular Trees only. There muſt therefore, doubtleſs, ſome peculiar diſpoſition concur in ſome ſorts of Trees, and in ſome Individual Trees of thoſe ſorts, by reaſon of which this ſuperfluous Humor may be generated, which the Soul of the Tree doth afterwards drive into the outward parts, and thereof Generates Miſſleto. And whereas it may be objected, that becauſe it grows upon Trees of ſeveral ſorts it cannot proceed from one and the ſame principle but if it came from the inward Nature of the Tree the Leaves of the Miſſleto ſhould differ according to the difference of the Tree: to that <hi>Scaliger</hi> anſwers, that it is not neceſſary that the Excrements of different Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſhould differ in outward appearance, but it ſuffices if they be rationally or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively different, as we ſee in the Tears of Plants. And although the external face is one and the ſame, yet the Nature it ſelf is different, and the Miſſleto of the Oak hath far other Virtues then that of the Apple-Tree. As alſo Galls are bred on ſundry Plants, as ſhall be anon declared. And this Juyce hath one peculiar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, that though the leaves of the Tree fal off, yet the Miſſleto keeps his Leaves all the year. <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> indeed, in 2. <hi>de Cauſs. Plant.</hi> writes that Miſſleto holds its Leaves all the year, upon ſuch Trees as hold their Leaves, but loſes them if it grow on Trees that ſhed their Leaves. But <hi>Scaliger</hi> rightly accuſes this of falſity. For every where in the Woods we ſee Miſſleto at all times green, upon the Oak, the Apple-Tree, the Birth-Tree, the Bullas-Tree, when thoſe Trees have loſt their Leaves. Yet is not this Humor ſimply ſuperfluous, but either part of the Alimenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or Seminal Juyce of the Tree, which the tree wantonizing (as it were) doth thruſt
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:35070:201"/>out: and therefore thoſe Trees on which Miſſletoes do grow do for the moſt part die.</p>
                  <p>After the ſame manner as Miſſleto doth grow on divers Trees,
<note place="margin">Galls.</note> ſo alſo Gals do grow upon the Oak, the Holme, the Beech; yea and <hi>Scaliger</hi> writes in the forealleadged place that he ſaw Galls grow upon Sage, of an Aſhy colour; and he relates alſo that Italian Merchants trading to <hi>Aleppo</hi> and other parts of <hi>Aſia</hi> informed him, that there is ſuch Apple-bearing Sage to be ſeen in many parts of <hi>Aſia.</hi>

                     <hi>Licetus</hi> indeed every where affirms that Plants are bred of corrupted Animals. But I ſcarce think there are any exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to be found of ſuch a thing, and that of the ſubſtance of Animals and their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements Plants ſhould be generated, as Worms are; unleſs peradventure the Seeds of Plants, or a Juyce containing in it the Seminal principle of Plants be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Excrements of Animals. And the examples which are brought of Plants bred out of Animals do hardly prove any thing elſe, then that the Seeds or rudiments of Plants may ſtick outwardly to the Bodies of Animals, and grow out of them and be augmented. Now Plants are bred either in living Animals or dead ones.
<note place="margin">How plants grow in Animals</note> As for live Animals, <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in 9. <hi>de Hiſt. Animal. Cap.</hi> 5. And <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſtus,</hi> 2. <hi>de Cauſſ. Plant. Cap.</hi> 23. do relate, that an Hart was caught, with green Ivy growing in his Horns, which (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> wel adds) being accidentally thruſt into the tender horn, as it were into a green Tree, became incorporated ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. Which both <hi>Pliny</hi> confirms, <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Cap.</hi> 32. as alſo <hi>Julius Caeſar Scaliger,</hi> who in his Comment upon that place of <hi>Theophraſtus,</hi> writes, that in the budding of his Horns the Hart rubbing them againſt ſome Ivy had broken a branch with a Root at it, which faſtned it ſelf into ſome tender part. <hi>Licetus</hi> indeed adds alſo two other manners, <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Spont. Vivent. Ort. Cap.</hi> 28. The former whereof is, that a duſty matter being blown into the Roots of the Horns near the Hair, and mixt with a various Humor, either proceeding from the Body of the Hart, (in form of ſweat or ſome other Excrement, or from the Air in form of dew or ſome other matter) did ſtick unto the Horns, to which poudery matter the form which had long lain therein as in a Veſſel being ſtirred up by the Heat of the Ambient Body doth now adjoyn it ſelf as a quickning and Jvy-making form. The other is this. He holds, that out of the Body it ſelf of the Hart an Excrementitious ſubſtance, bred chiefly by eating of Ivy, by the concoctive and expulſive faculty ſeparated and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled with other Excrements of the third digeſtion to the Roots of the Horns, and by reaſon of its own clammineſs or ſome other glutinous matter ſticking there faſt, it is by the ambient heat digeſted into a new living Plant. But neither of theſe waies is probable. For as to the former, if ſo great a quantity of duſty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter might be collected at the Roots of Horns in the Hairs, that therein as in the Earth Ivy might grow, other plants might alſo grow there. Nor can any reaſon be ſhewed, why that poudery Humor gathered at the Roots of the Harts-Horns ſhould be collected only from Ivy. Again, it cannot eaſily be ſhewed, how the Soul of the Ivy through ſo many digeſtions can arrive ſafely to the Horns of the Hart; nor can any reaſon be ſhewed, why other Plants alſo ſhould not grow on the Harts-Horns.</p>
                  <p>But on the back of Shell-fiſh and Whales moſſie Herbs grow out of the Mud and Scum of the Sea,
<note place="margin">Moſs gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing on Shel-fiſh and on the Backs of Whales.</note> ſticking to the Backs of theſe Fiſhes, which contain in them the Seeds or Seminal rudiments of Moſs and other Plants. But that other manner ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Licetus</hi> of Excrements driven from the inner parts of the Beaſt into the ſurface is leſs probable then the former. For it is not credible, that Whales feed upon Moſs and Plants. And if this manner were true, other Fiſhes which are known to feed upon Graſs, Moſs and Plants, ſhould have moſſie Plants growing upon their Backs.

                  </p>
                  <p>Now it is worthy our conſideration to examin, whether Plants do grow alſo out of the Carkaſſes of Animals. <hi>Licetus</hi> ſaith they do, and that it is no news, <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Spont. Vivent. Ort. Cap.</hi> 32. But this muſt be fitly explained. For I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that as Worms are bred of the very ſubſtance of dead Carkaſſes, ſo alſo Plants are Generated of the ſame ſubſtance; nor doth experience confirm the ſame. Upon the Skuls and Bones of Men Moſs is bred. But ſince it grows not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch bones as lie under a roof or covering, but on ſuch only as lie in the open Air
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:35070:201"/>and are wet by the Rain, the original thereof is rather to be attributed to the Rain, like that which grows upon Stones. For ſince, as was ſaid before, the principles of the Seeds of Plants are mixt with Rain, if they fal upon bones, eſpecially ſuch as are Rotten and begin to turn to duſt, the ſaid Seminal principle ſticking in them and finding matter to work on, and cheriſhed by the Ambient heat, if it do not make other Plants, it will at leaſt generate Moſs.</p>

<note place="margin">Whether Aſparagus do grow upon the horns of a Ram.</note> but Fabulous without doubt; nor doth experience confirm the ſame. <hi>Fortunius Licetus</hi> indeed, in the place fore alleadged, endeavors to defend it by four Reaſons, but all in Vain.

                  <p>The other is, becauſe Animals are bred of the Carkaſs of Plants, Namely worms out of Wood, whereas nevertheleſs the Carkaſſes of Plants are more imperfect then the Carkall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And ſeeing that it is much eaſier for a thing to procreate that which is more imperfect then it ſelf, then to act beyond its forces by breeding that which is more perfect: credible therefore it is, that Aſparagus may grow upon the Horns of a Ram. But Carkaſſes do not as the efficient cauſes breed any thing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but we muſt look to the diſpoſition of the matter, and conſult with experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, what may be made out of thoſe ſubordinate forms. Moreover, although Worms are Animals, yet it is a queſtion whether they are more perfect then perfect Plants. Nor doth any reaſon enforce, that as out of an Animal another Animal though of a different ſort may be generated, ſo alſo a Plant may be bred thereby.</p>
                  <p>His Third Reaſon is, becauſe it hath been obſerved that in the Sea Coral hath grown out of a dead-mans Skul. If therefore Coral were bred out of a Skul, Aſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragus may alſo grow out of horns. But how Coral may grow upon a Skull, (which notwithſtanding is very rare) hath been lately ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Since Ivy hath been found to grow upon the Horns of an Hart; Aſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragus may in like manner grow upon a Rams horns. But the caſe is different.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Johannes Marcus Marci,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Marci.</note> in <hi>Defen. Idaearum ſuarum, Prefat. Loco Tract it. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſa,</hi> teaches, that ſuch Forms divided from the ſociety of matter, becauſe they are impaſſible do need no place. Yet becauſe a finite Eſſence is neceſſarily deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be in ſome part of an imaginary place, he holds, that it abides in that part of a place where it is ſeparated from its ſubjuct, and is neither by it ſelf nor by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident Locally moved. And in Chap. 4. of the ſame Treatiſe, he writes that ſuch Souls, the Corporeal number failing, (into which they had degenerated by the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of matter) being freed from Corporeal Laws they return to the unity of the ſimple eſſence in which they were at firſt created. Yea, he conceives that they are not to periſh at the laſt day, but that the form of this world being paſſed, they ſhal not at all be ſubject to thoſe viciſſitudes, nor reaſſume any Bodies, but paſſing the time in eternal ſilence they ſhall as well as the Elements diſtinguiſh and adorne the world with a wonderful variety of Eſſences, without ſenſible Figures, the world being no leſs abſolute and perfect then now it is. But theſe things are only ſaid and not proved, nor do the Reaſons before alleadged for this opinion ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently prove the ſame. To which before we make anſwer, that is to be noted in the firſt place which <hi>Scaliger</hi> hath, <hi>Excrcitat</hi> 207. <hi>Sect.</hi> 20. All that is (ſaies he) is either the firſt principle or proceeding from the firſt. There is but one firſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reſt depend thereupon. Therefore all things, but one, are in their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture corruptible. For although beings are free from ſubject and Term; yet are they not free from cauſe. They are therefore by another and from another. But every thing dependent may be changed by that on which it depends if it be voluntary. And therefore the immaterial minds themſelves as they depend upon the firſt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, at the Pleaſure of the firſt they may be depoſed from that Eſſence wherein
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:35070:202"/>they are placed by him. For if they could not, they muſt have in them another principle reſiſting his infinite power. And then he ſhould not be the firſt principle. But they are not corrupted, becauſe it is not his pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Johannes Serranus</hi> upon the <hi>Timaeus</hi> of <hi>Plato,</hi> writes according to <hi>Platos</hi> opinion: God only truly is, and therefore he only is truly eternal, and the Foundation of all created things, all which have this common adjunct, that they had a beginning; yet the Nature of things created is not one, but various and manifold. For ſome by the pleaſure and power of the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter have a more firm and conſtant eſſence, and therefore compared with other things they have a kind of eternity, given them by favour of the Creator: yet are they not truely eternal; ſince they did proceed from a certain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and when the Work-maſter ſhall pleaſe may have an End. For the glorious God is only independent and ſimply immutable. But all the parts of the World being created by God, as by a voluntary Principle, do depend upon him in their Eſſence and conſervation; or they have their Eſſence in God, and are preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by him. But Angels and the Human Soul, inaſmuch as they are immortal, they have not their immortality of themſelves and their own Nature, but by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of God, by whoſe power they are preſerved. God only hath immortality and immutability communicated from no other: but the Human Soul and Angels have immortality indeed, but communicated from God, by whoſe Favor and grace it is that they have in themſelves no inclination to non-being, but may alſo be conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and ſubſiſt without matter. Whereof <hi>Damaſcenus, Orthodox. Fid. Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. <hi>Angelos Athanatos, ou Phuſei, alla Chariti: an Angel is immortal not by Nature but by Grace.</hi> Now God hath afforded this Grace and Favor, not to all Creatures, but only to Angels and the Human Soul; but all other forms and Souls are ſo ſubject to the will of the Creator, or ſo immerſed into this matter, that out of it they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be preſerved, but their ſubject periſhing they have a natural inclination to not being, and being deſtitute of their ſubject they are annihilated.</p>
                  <p>Out of which it is eaſie to anſwer to the Arguments for their opinion who hold,
<note place="margin">The former arguments anſwered.</note> that the Souls of Brutes and Plants cannot be Annihilated. For Firſt, whereas they ſay, that what ever is created by God cannot by any creature be Annihilated,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> nor the Creator be hindred from the action of conſervation; all that, truly, we grant, but we ſay withal, that ſuch was the free pleaſure of God, that ſome forms ſhould be immortal, others corruptible; and therefore he is not by any Creature hindred from the act of Conſervation, but by his own moſt free will withdraws the ſaid act, ſince he would have ſuch to be liable to perpetual Generation and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and would not have individuals perpetual, but that the kinds of things ſhould be perpetuated by reparation of new Individuals. And if it were not ſo, what difference would there be betwixt the Soul of a man and the Souls of Beaſts? And thus not only the Human Soul, but the Souls of brutes and Plants ſhould be immortal.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Although the Souls of Plants and Brutes do periſh as ſoon as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual dies: yet God doth not therefore repent of his works. For as God of his own moſt free Good will created them of nothing, as an Eſſential being, ſo he moſt freely withdrawing his conſervation ſuffers them to return to nothing.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, All ſorts indeed of things tend to the perfection of the world,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and no ſort is aboliſhed; but all Individuals are not neceſſary for the perfection of the world, but there is in them a various Intercourſe of Generations and Corruptions. Now the ſorts neceſſary to the worlds perfection may be as well maintained in a few Individuals as in many. And when after the flood there were but a few indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual Animals, the world was not more imperfect then now it is.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> That Place therefore of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> muſt be underſtood of the ſorts and not of the Individuals of Animals and Plants.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> We grant that the forms of Plants and imperfect Animals do not alwaies periſh when they are thought ſo to do, but thoſe that were thought to be aboliſhed do lie hid for a time, and afterwards return to life again, either in their former or in a new ſhape.</p>
                  <p>Now this therefore happens, becauſe thoſe forms do not require for their ſimple being a matter ſo noble, variouſly elaborated, and furniſhed with ſo many Organs, but can many times lie hid for a Seaſon in ſome place. But this is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:35070:203"/>for they alſo are at laſt aboliſhed. But in more perfect Animals, where the Seeds if they muſt be perſerved muſt of neceſſity be forthwith received into the Womb, the Soul cannot be perſerved out of its Body and out of its Seed. And let them ſhew us but the leaſt ſign or token, whereby it may appear that the Soul of a Lyon, an Ox, an Horſe, a Dog, did ever live after the Death of the ſaid Animals.</p>

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:35070:203"/>the Soul and of the Aliment begets a ſubſtance) hence it is that this Heat was to be lively and ſtrong, and endued with a vital faculty. Nor ought we to refer this force to the ſimple Intention of heat, as <hi>Galen</hi> did, 3. <hi>Aphoriſm.</hi> 20. who propounds no faculty above heat. For although heat concurs to the production of living things; yet unleſs a ſuperior vital cauſe doth concur, it cannot of it ſelf produce an Animal. And whereas afterward he makes that Cauſe to be the Coeleſtial Bodies, therin he is out; ſince he doth not propound an univocal and proper Cauſe, as was ſaid before in <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. The Opinion of <hi>Thomas Minadous</hi> long ſince a renowned profeſſor in the Univerſity of <hi>Padua</hi> was more true and accurate, who in his Treatile <hi>De hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mani Corporis Turpitudinibus, Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 9.

And a little after when he had related their Opinion who held heat to be the efficient Cauſe, he adds: but on the other ſide, ſince it ſeems impoſſible, that the introduction of a Form and ſhaping of an whole Animal ſhould be the effect of bare heat, but that it depends upon ſome provident action of a certain Artificer working with diſcourſe and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; the mind is forced to ſeek out another agent beſides heat, which can moder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate all things in the forming of an Animal with Councel and Choice. For heat alone hath never learnt to ſhape an Arm, a Leg, an Eye, with its own ſhape, nor hath it been accuſtomed to uſe the Diſcipline of ſome Maſter; but acting alwaies after the ſame manner converts it ſelf to ſundry things, ſets it ſelf about ſundry forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, according as the builder and Architect of all the parts directs and moves the ſame. Nor doth <hi>Minadous</hi> attribute the generation of perfect Animals alone to a ſuperior power, but of Lice alſo. For although <hi>Galen</hi> conſidering the Generation of Wig-Lice, Lice, Fleas, and the like petty Animals, durſt not aſcribe their Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to this div<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:35070:204"/>when it is burning it riſes into bubbles. And therefore without doubt that ſame ſtone contains in it ſome kind of Earth tempered with moiſture, in which moiſture doubtleſs the form is, which is afterward actuated by the force of Heat, and being rouzed ingenders this Animal; as in other furnaces and about Bakers Ovens Crickets are engendred of the Morter.

                  <p>That Animals are alſo bred in the Snow <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> teaches, <note place="margin">Animals bred out of the Snow.</note> 5. <hi>de Hiſt. Anim. Cap.</hi> 19. Yea alſo, ſaith he, in thoſe things which can ſuffer no corruption, we have known Animals to breed, as reddiſh hairy Worms in old Snow. But in the Snow of <hi>Media</hi> greater and Whiter are found; they are all ſluggiſh and move very hardly. He relates alſo the ſame thing in 2. <hi>de Plantis, Cap.</hi> 1. And <hi>Pliny Lib.</hi> 11. <hi>Cap.</hi> 35. writes. In old white Snow Worms are found; in the middeſt of the Snows thickneſs reddiſh (for the Snow it ſelf looks red with Age) hairy, large, and Lazy. And <hi>Olaus Magnus, Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Hiſt. Septentr. reg. cap.</hi> 8. ſaith thus: in the moſt vaſt deſarts of <hi>Iſeland,</hi> eſpecially under Juniper Trees, and great heaps of Chaff or Straws, although the Sun be in the Scorching ſign of <hi>Leo,</hi> there is ſnow lying, wherein in the Summer time they keep Wine and Beer who deſire to drink Luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly; but no Body mingles the Snow with his Wine or Beer, becauſe of its Clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineſs and Impurity. For Worms and Moths are found in it, juſt as in Cloaths ill laid up.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mercurialis</hi> indeed, <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Variar. Lect. cap.</hi> 4. doth altogether queſtion the truth hereof, becauſe Heat is required for the Generation of Animals which is not in Snow, and becauſe the Snow is wont to kill ſuch petty Animals in the Earth as are wont to hurt the fruits thereof. And if any Worms are ſeen in Snow, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives they came out of the Earth, and ſo entred into the Snow. But theſe Reaſons are not ſufficient to make us reject the teſtimonies of ſo many Learned Men. For there is ſome heat in Snow. Although Snow of its own Nature is exceeding cold, yet it may receive Warmth from the Sun and from the Earth; eſpecially out of the Earth many hot exhalations do ariſe, which the Snow retains within it Self. And therefore husband men do in the Winter wiſh for Snow to cover their ſowed Lands; becauſe experience hath taught them, that the Corn is ſooner hurt by the coldneſs of the Winter Air if it be not covered with Snow, then when it is ſo covered; not that the Snow it ſelf doth warm the Corn, but becauſe it keeps in and retains the exhalations which ſpring out of the Earth, and hinders the coldneſs of the Air from piercing to the Corn.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe Worms are bred in the Snow,
<note place="margin">How Worms are bred in the ſnow.</note> not as it is ſimply Snow or Rain congea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with cold but inaſmuch as Pouders, Juyces, or Excrements of Plants or Animals diſpoſed to the production of ſuch Worms are mixed therewith; and then Worms are bred of Snow after the ſame manner as of Rain, of which we ſhall ſpeak here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Again the ſame Exhalations and Atomes may aſcend out of the Earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ful of them, when it is covered with Snow, and may ſo be mingled with the Snow. Yea and duſt containing in it the Rudiments of ſuch Animals may by the winds be brought from elſwhere, and mixed with the Snow; which chiefly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in Snow that hath lain long. Now this matter which way ſoever it comes to be mingled with the Snow, when after it comes to be cheriſhed by the Ambient heat, raiſed partly by the Sun, partly from hot Vapors exhaling out of the Ground, the concealed form diſplaies it ſelf and produces Worms. Now, this ſeldom happens in the upper part of the Snow, ſince the heat exhaling out of the Earth, neceſſary to excite the Form, doth hardly riſe ſo high, nor can long continue there, ſeeing it is eaſily diſſipated by the cold Winds.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo wel known to Husband-men,
<note place="margin">From Rain, Dew Miſts.</note> that out of Rain, Dew, and Miſts, ſundry petty Animals are bred in thoſe Plants which they fal upon; as they often find to their great dammage. For by the Heat of the Sun Vapors out of all kinds of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary Bodies are carried from the Earth up into the Air: wherein there being Atomes containing in them forms diſpoſed to breed ſuch petty Animals, or an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal-making Nature, as <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> calls it; when they are cheriſhed by the Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent heat, and gain that diſpoſition of matter which is neceſſary to the performance of operations ſundry ſorts of Worms are generated. And theſe Worms are either

                  <p>For it hath been alſo obſerved that petty Animals have fallen down with Rain.
<note place="margin">Animals falling down with Rain.</note> So <hi>Olaus Magnus, de Hiſtor. Septentr. Lib.</hi> 18. <hi>Cap.</hi> 16. writes: Not only in <hi>Norway,</hi> ſaith he, but alſo in <hi>Heſtingia,</hi> and in many other Provinces of the <hi>Dioceſs</hi> of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſal</hi> certain ſmal four-footed Creatures called <hi>Lemnars,</hi> of the bigneſs of Mice, with a party coloured Skin, do fall down with the Rain; and it is yet unknown whence they come, whether brought by the Winds from the neighbouring or other remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Iſlands, or bred rather in the clouds. Yet this is well known, that ſome of them having been cut open as ſoon as they fell down were found to have raw Herbs in their ſtomach, as yet undigeſted. Theſe falling down like Locuſts in Huge quantities deſtroy all green things, and infect whatever they touch with their mouths, and they live till they taſt the Second ſprouting of the Herbs and go away all together, like ſwallows taking their flight; but at a certain ſet time they die in great multitudes, exceedingly infecting the Earth and Air, which becomes peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential; whereby men are taken with dizzineſs in their Heads and with the Yellow Jaundize. So far <hi>Olaus Magnus.</hi> But it is ſcarce credible that Animals can be bred in the Air. For ſuppoſe it, that Animals have fallen out of the Air: Yet, it is doubtful whether they were bred there; ſeeing Winds and whirle Winds carry many things from the Earth into the Air which owe their original not to the Air but to the Earth. And ſince there are ſundry winged Animals in the Summer time flying in the Air, if they ſhould be ſurprized with a ſudden thick ſhower, or beaten down with the weight of great drops of Rain, or ſhould be hindred from flying by the wetneſs of their Wings, they might well fall down with the Rain, though they were not Generated in the Air. Nor is it probable that they could be bred in the Air. For, ſince all Animals are heavy, and riſe not up into the Air, unleſs by Leaping or Flying, or except they are detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therein ſome other way; they do by their weight all tend unto the Earth, and reſt themſelves upon the ſurface thereof, and conſequently cannot be generated in the Air.

But that Clouds being rare Bodies ſhould ſo putrifie as for Animals to be bred of them; or that vapors from Carkaſſes, (few being drawn up in thoſe cold Countries) ſhould be carried aloft and putrifie in a cold place, and be turned into Animals, is not probable; but likely it is, that in ſome Iſle, or other neighbouring place unknown (as there are many unknown places in thoſe Regions) thoſe Animals were bred, and by force of Winds like Locuſts were brought into <hi>Norway.</hi> Which may be known hereby, that when the ſaid Animals were cut up preſently upon their falling raw Herbs were found in their Stomachs undigeſted, which doubtleſs they had eaten in ſome other place, and not in the Clouds.</p>

Which are really Earth-Fiſhes. For in puddliſh and Muddy places, where the Summer hath dried up the Water which had been there collected in the Winter, they are dug up out of the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:35070:205"/>Mud. And concerning Eeles it is reported, as we read in <hi>Ariſtotle, Lib.</hi> 6.

But I cannot beleeve that Eeles have no Seminal principles; ſeeing they are caught in Rivers, as wel as in Muddy Ponds, 'tis credible thoſe that are taken do leave ſome Seminal principle behind them, out of which afterwards others are generated: and ſome conceive that Eeles do grow of the ſlime, which the former Eeles caſt from their outſides, as the Snake caſts his Skin. Of which <hi>Scaliger</hi> alſo writes <hi>Exercit.</hi> 15. Eeles are thought to generate nothing within themſelves, but by their mutual twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and twiſtings one about another they are thought to make a kind of Slime, of which yong ones are generated without.</p>
                  <p>Oiſters alſo and all Shel-Fiſh are bred of Slime, concerning which <hi>Opianus,</hi> in his Poem of Fiſhes, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. thus writes:
<q>
                        <l>They couple not nor bring forth any young,</l>
                        <l>But of themſelves they breed the Mud among,</l>
                        <l>As Oiſters do, Glib Oiſters that no Male</l>
                        <l>Nor Female have.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet ſome aver that Snailes do alſo couple, and that they have ſeen them Joyn together, and ſticking one to another, ſo as to ſend forth a ſlimy froth, which after a day or two was changed into the ſhape of a Snail. Nor is it abſurd, that they may be bred both waies, ſo that when many have been generated Spontaneouſly, thoſe may afterwrads generate more by Copulation of Male and Female.</p>
                  <p>Moreover the <hi>

For although they have no ſex, yet they may have Seed, ſince they are Plant-Animals, and belong partly to Plants, wherein alſo there is not properly any Sex; and therefore it is not abſurd to think they may ſend forth Seed, which ſticking to the Rocks may be formed into a Body like the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerator; which way ſoever this emiſſion of Seed is cauſed, whether by Seed proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo called, or by ſome other thing Analogical to Seed.</p>
                  <p>And inaſmuch as ſo many Animals are bred out of the Earth, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid very wel, that all things are after a ſort ful of Souls. For every where almoſt ſmalleſt Bodies or Petty Atomes are found, ſevered from the Bodies of Animals, wherein there is a Soul but Latent, and not exerciſing the ſecond Act or Functions of a Soul. For thoſe more Ignoble Animals do not ſend forth ſeed as the perfect Animals do, but a Seminal principle diſperſed through their whole Body, as it is in ſome Plants. And therefore it is no wonder, that the Bodies of ſuch Animals being turned to Duſt ſhould be like Seed, and having afterward attained a ſitting place ſhould again produce Animals. <hi>Pliny</hi> knew thus much, who <hi>Lib.</hi> 9. <hi>Cap.</hi> 51. writes thus of Frogs: 'Tis ſtrange (ſaith he) how after ſix Months time of Life they are turned into Slime and no man perceives it, and in the Spring they are again regener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in the Water, after the ſame ſecret manner, and this happens every year.</p>
                  <p>Alſo ſundry Animals are bred of Plants, and ſome of Plants that are yet living, and others of dead Plants: yet every Worm is not bred of every Plant, but certain Worms of certain Plants; as alſo the ſame worms do not breed out of all Carkaſſes of Animals, but ſome out of one ſort, ſome out of another, and the forms of ſuch inſects ſeem to be ſubordinate to the forms of Animals and of Plants.

But which are generated from which, we ſhall hereafter ſhew when we come to ſpeak more particularly. Concerning which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath many excellent things wel worth the reading in 5. <hi>Hiſt. Animal.</hi> eſpecially in the 19. Chap. Where he teaches in general, that Worms and Caterpillars are bred of Plants, and of them <hi>Chryſalides</hi> Golden-Worms, and of them butter-flies and other Winged Animals are bred. For not
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:35070:206"/>only Butter-flies, but other winged Animals alſo are bred of Plants, as Flies, Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and ſuch like.
<note place="margin">The Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal of Flies.</note> Concerning the Spontaneous Original of Flies <hi>

I, as I will not deny but Flies may be generated out of any putrid matter, and out of the Carkaſſes of Animals, (and I have ſhewed before that out of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifying fleſh of other Animals as wel as of Bulls Bees are generated as from the moſt fitting matter) yet I conceive they are bred for the moſt part of Plants, and I have obſerved an example thereof. For when, ſome years agone, in the Winter time, when no other green Herbs were to be had, I did beat red Cole-worts, and kept them in a ſtove til they bred Worms, the Worms generated thereof turnd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Golden Caterpillars, which when I had kept ſhut in a Box, and afterward came to open the ſame, a troop of ſmal Flies made their eſcape, which were bred of the Caterpillars, and broke out of their Crackt Skins.</p>
                  <p>But to come to Particular ſorts;
<note place="margin">Animals bred of Muſhroms</note> in the firſt place, truly, 'tis very well known that of Muſhroms which are the loweſt ſort of Plants, Worms are bred. Of the Generation where of <hi>Fortunius Licetus</hi> diſputes <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Spont. Viv Ort. cap.</hi> 44. and conceives that they cannot be produced by the Soul of the Toad-ſtool or Muſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom, becauſe it is in the loweſt ranke of vegetables and cannot act beyond its power, ſo as to procreate a ſenſible Soul more noble then the vegerable. And that alſo for the ſame reaſon the Soul of a Muſhrom cannot be changed into a ſenſitive Soul. But he himſelf holds that Worms are bred of Muſhroms, becauſe in the ſubſtance of a Puck-fiſt, a Toad-ſtool or Muſhrom, many petty Bodies or Atomes are contained, which came from the Bodies of Animals either living or dead, in which Bodies a Portion of the old ſenſitive Soul doth remain as in a veſſel, which the Toad-ſtool coming to wither, and it having by the heat of the ambient Air at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained diſpoſitions neceſſary to life, it is Spontaneouſly animated and turns to little Worms. But this opinion of <hi>Licetus</hi> hath been often propounded and examined. In this place, we ſhall firſt obſerve this doubt therein, whether or no thoſe little Worms which are of the kind of Animals are ſimply more noble then Plants: of which there ſeems no neceſſity. For the Creator did not in the firſt place intend and create thoſe Worms, but the Plants as we ſhewed before, <hi>cap.</hi> 4. ſpeaking of the final end of theſe kind of Creatures. Again it hath been often ſaid, that that Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis of <hi>Licetus</hi> will hardly be granted, that the form of nobler Animals ſhould be changed into the form of Ignoble Worms. Moreover Toad-ſtools are often bred upon Trees, and under Trees in Woods, where it is ſcarce credible that there hath been any Carkaſs of an Animal. Yea and they are bred every year. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though peradventure Animals have diſcharged their Excrements in thoſe places, yet the Soul of an Animal was not in them.</p>
                  <p>Moreover worms are bred out of ſundry perfect plants,
<note place="margin">Worms out of living Plants.</note> whiles are they living. <hi>Pliny Lib.</hi> 13. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. writes, The Turpentine Tree bears certain Bladderkies, out of which certain gnats or other Animals do ſpring.

As in the Cods of Elmes there are bred much ſuch like. And therefore the Arabians are wont to call the Elme the Tree of Wig-Lice. or lowlie Tree. So out of the pith of the Fullers Thiſtle when it is ripe a ſmal Worm grows: which <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> truly reports to be good againſt the Quartan Ague. Such Bladders alſo the Turpentine Tree bears, wherein are a certain Liquor and Gnats. It is exceeding well known that Worms are bred in Haſel-Nuts, Cherries, Apples, and Plums.

Pag.</hi> 87. where he ſaies, that Caterpillars and other petty Animals do not only breed of certain plants, but that a Caterpillar bred of one Plant doth not feed upon another, but only upon its own out of which it was generated: as for example, if a Cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillar were bred out of a Plant of Rue, it will feed upon other the like Plants of Rue, but not on all that bear the Name of Rue, as Goates Rue and Dogs Rue, by late Authors ſo called, nor on the Leaves of any other Plant unleſs it be of the ſame Nature, and quality. And thoſe that are bred upon the Radiſh will Eat the Leaves of Radiſh, but of no other plant, unleſs peradventure it be a Plant of the ſame kind, as Cole-worts, Rapes, Navews and ſuch like. From which obſervation of the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Caterpillars I conceive a man may know the qualities of the Plants they feed upon. For Silk-worms we know eat the Leaves of Brambles and Mulberries, our People when the Worms are little lay Bramble Leaves upon them for their food, and when they are greater the Leaves of the black Mulberry Tree, which are queſtion leſs of the ſame Nature with the bramble leaves, for they do doth bind and color, as <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> teſtifies: ſo that from the food of theſe Caterpillars and Butter-flies we may know what Plants are of like Nature. For if Caterpillars or Butter-flies feed upon divers Plants of the ſame kind, 'tis Credible they have like Vertues and qualities. So far <hi>Fabius Columna.</hi>

<note place="margin">How Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillars and Butter flies are Generated</note> 
                     <hi>Ariſtotle, Lib.</hi> 9. <hi>de Hiſtor. Animal. cap.</hi> 19. thus writes thereof: Butter-Flies (ſaith he) are bred of Caterpillars; Caterpillars of living Leaves of Plants, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of the Cole-wort. Firſt of all a ſmal Seed leſs then Millet lies upon the leaf, ſoon after of that Seed ſmal Worms are bred and grow, then within three daies they become ſmal Caterpillars; which being augmented ceaſe moving, and change their ſhape, and are for a ſmal time called <hi>Chryſalides,</hi> as if you would ſay Golden Worms. They are covered with an hard Shel ſtirring when you touch them, and full of little pores. They have no mouth, nor other member diſcernable. A long time after the Shel being broken, out Flies a parcel of winged Creatures which we call Butter Flies. And therefore at firſt whiles they are Caterpillars they are nouriſhed by food, and void Excrements. But when they are turned into thoſe <hi>Aureliae</hi> or Golden-worms, they neither Eat nor void any thing. And concerning the Generation of the Silk-worm, in the ſame place; It is made of a certain large worm, which thruſts out two horns as it were, and is of a kind by it ſelf, which is firſt wholly changed into a Caterpillar, then it becomes a Fly like a Butter-Fly, and afterward it is called <hi>Necydalus.</hi> Which various ſucceſſion of Forms is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed in the ſpace of ſix Months.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes Aldrovandus</hi> in the place fore alleadged diſſents from <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and thus he deſcribes the Generation of theſe Creatures: every Butter-fly is bred of the Worm called <hi>Chryſalis</hi> the <hi>Chryſalis</hi> of a Caterpillar, the Caterpillar of the Eggs of Butter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flies; whoſe end is not to breed Caterpillars or Gold-Worms, but other Butter-flies. But he blames <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> for not having obſerved that the ſeed on the leaf was the ſeed of a Butter-fly; and for not underſtanding, that thoſe little Worms which firſt break out of the Eggs are ſmal Caterpillars. But in good deed, although it cannot be denied, that ſome Caterpillars are bred of the Seed of Butter-flies (which I doubt whether <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> were ignorant of) and that the Seed on the Leaves of Plants, leſs then that of Millet, is the Seed of Butter-flies: yet the queſtion now is, whether Butterflies are only bred of Seed, or whether they are not alſo Spontaneouſly generated: ſince certain it is that many Animals Spontaneouſly generated do ſend forth Seed. And experience ſhews that ſuch Worms and Caterpillars are bred out of Dew and Rains falling down upon Plants. For in the ſpring time for the moſt part Caterpillars are thus bred before
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:35070:207"/>Butterflies are ſeen; and therefore ſince theſe Caterpillars come before Butterflies, it is a ſign that they are not bred of the Seed of Butterflies, but of corrupted Plants. Which <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> himſelf was forced to confeſs, when he relates afterwards, that thoſe Caterpillars which are turned into Butterflies are not all bred of Butterflies Eggs, but ſome of them of the corruption of Plants. Which experience alſo doth Teſtifie, whence it is manifeſt, that frequently Caterpillars are bred of the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Plants, and of the Caterpillars Butterflies are bred, which bring forth Eggs, out of which again Caterpillars are bred, and of them again Butterflies. In the ſame place <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> denies that all Butterflies are bred of Caterpillars, but ſome, he ſaies, are generated of Worms; and he writes that if Corn be over moiſt it breeds Worms, which turn to Gold-Worms, and they to Butterflies. He writes alſo, that he hath ſeen Butterflies come out of hollow Trees eſpecially Willows, with their Skins wherein they were bred ſcarce off. But here it is to be inquired, whether or no thoſe Worms were not Caterpillars, which were afterward changed into Gold-worms, and they into Butterflies. Nor are Caterpillars all of one kind, but ſome are bred of Living Plants, others of Corn, others out of Wood. And thoſe Caterpillars of which Silk-worms are engendred do not retain the ſame Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, but change their Coats four ſeveral times. Whereof ſee <hi>Libavius Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Bombyctor.</hi> who hath written moſt diligently concerning this matter. This is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, that all thoſe little worms which hide themſelves in down, or wrap them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Leaves of Trees, after ſome changes of their outward ſhapes are changed into a flying Creature, like to that by which the Eggs were laid</p>
                  <p>This I have alſo obſerved in Caterpillars bred of Indian Water-creſſes, which they frequently feed upon, being kept in a Glaſs; that out of their Bellies live Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures did come forth, which died ſoon after, and would queſtion leſs revive again the next Spring, and the Caterpillars themſelves alſo died, no Butter flies being of them generated. Wherein I was confirmed by that which <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> relates <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Inſectis, Cap.</hi> 1. how that ſuch as have written of the wonders of the new World do report concerning Piſmires, how that out of the Body of the dead Parent innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable little Worms ariſe, which live after a wonderful manner, until being winged they fly out of their underground Habitations; although the Parents do ſomtimes bring forth during their Life.</p>
                  <p>We conceive that Gnats alſo are bred of the corruption of living,
<note place="margin">The gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Gnats.</note> or withered Plants. For although Gnats are generated out of Water and Vinegar: yet that happens, becauſe they contain in them either the parts or Juyces of Plants.

Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Cap.</hi> 19. they are alſo bred of Water, eſpecially ſtanding Water: yet there is no queſtion but many things are bred therein by the corruption of Plants.

But this manner is ſcarce agreeable to reaſon; eſpecially that Geeſe and Ducks ſhould be thus bred. For it is not credible that the Souls of ſuch perfect Animals ſhould be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main perfect and intire under ſo many Mutations. Nor doth the ſenſitive Soul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute any Animal in its kind; and every Animal, as for example a Lion, an Ox, a Gooſe, an Hare, hath not only a ſenſitive Soul but a ſpecifical Soul of its own, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from the Souls of all other Animals.</p>
                  <p>The Second manner he makes to be of Atomes,
<note place="margin">The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</note> which have flowed from the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Animals, flying in the Air, and driven into the ſubſtance of Plants and ſticking thereto by the clammineſs of Dew, and being driven within the Porous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or the Downy corpulency; which in fit ſeaſon being digeſted by the concoctive faculty of the ambient Air, and prepared for another life, they become living Creatures, <hi>viz.</hi> Caterpillars, Spiders, <hi>Cantharides,</hi> Geeſe and ſuch like Animals. But neither is this manner probable unleſs it be limited. For that Geeſe ſhould be generated of Atomes flying in the Air, and ſticking to Plants, as it is a thing unheard of, ſo any one may eaſily underſtand that it is impoſſible. But this we grant, that with the Rain and Dew a matter fals upon Plants, and cleaves to them, out of which Caterpillars are generated, and other ſuch like Inſects. Nor do we deny, that Atomes in which the Seeds of ſuch living Creatures do ſtick may deſcend with Rain or Dew upon Plants: Yet we do not think that this is alwaies neceſſary ſince the Excrements of Plants and Animals and their corrupted parts have this power, and the Seminal principles of theſe Animals are faſtned upon Plants by the dew and Rain.</p>
                  <p>The Third manner he makes to be, when Atomes or Juyces of the ſame kind,

And if after this manner Animals ſhould be bred of living Plants, many more would be generated then are: How beit certain Animals are nevertheleſs bred of certain Plants.</p>

But if this were true, why ſhould they not be bred in the Skin, hairs, or Garments of Men and Women, as Lice and Fleas are? And therefore it is more likely, and experience doth witneſs the ſame, that they are bred in Bedſteads <hi>[underſtand Dutch Beadſteads]</hi> and eſpecially in their chinks, and in the Wood of the Walls next the Bed, which is their proper place. And if they are found elſwhere in the Straw, or in Garments, they have crept thither from the Bed-ſteads. Howbeit, there is aſſiſtant to their Generation the filth or rather the Vapors of Men and Women ſleeping, which ſticking to the Wood corrupt the ſame and cauſe it to breed theſe Vermin.

Others conceive they are bred none of theſe waies, but that they are hatched of Eggs, as other Animals are.</p>
                     <p>But I think it wil be beſt to ſet down the Relations of Authors themſelves concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this matter. <hi>Fortunius Licetus</hi> produceth this follwing Account (in <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Spont. Viv. Ort. Cap.</hi> 47.) out of <hi>Turner. The former Gooſe is termed by our country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men a Brand Gooſe and a Barnacle; it is leſs then a wild Gooſe, on the breſt partly black, on the Reſt of the Body of an Aſh-color. It Flies and cries like wild Geeſe, frequents ſtanding Waters, and devours ſtanding Corn. The fleſh of this kind is ſomwhat unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and not in requeſt amongſt the Rich. No man ever ſaw the Neſt or Egg of a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle; which is no wonder: becauſe they are without the help of any parent, Spontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly bred after this manner. When the maſt, or ſome Fir-boards of a Ship have lain Rotting for a time in the Sea, there grows thereout, at firſt, certain Muſhroms as it were; in which in proceſs of time the manifeſt Forms of Birds are to be ſeen, which are afterward cloathed with Feathers, and at laſt quicken and fly. And I would not have any one think that this is a Fable, for beſides the common Teſtimony of all People living upon the Sea-coaſts of</hi> England, Scotland <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>that ſame Fam us Hiſtorian</hi> Gyraldus, <hi>who hath wrot the Hiſtory of</hi> Ireland, <hi>(more happily much then could be expected in the Age wherein he lived) doth teſtifie that Barnacles are Generated no otherwiſe then as we have ſaid. But counting it not ſafe to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:35070:208" rendition="simple:additions"/>beleeve vulgar reports, and not crediting</hi> Gyraldus <hi>by reaſon of the Novelty of the matter, while I was ruminating upon this ſubject whereof I now write, I made enquiry of a certain Iriſh Divine Named</hi> Octavianus, <hi>whom I knew by experience to be a very honeſt and credible Perſon; whether he conceived a man might beleeve</hi> Gyraldus <hi>in this point: whoſe anſwer was (ſwearing by the Goſpel he did profeſs) that what</hi> Gyraldus <hi>had reported concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Generation of this Bird was moſt true; and that he had ſeen with his own Eyes, and handled with his hands ſome of theſe fowl before they were come to perfection; and that if I would tarry a month or two longer at</hi> London, <hi>be would ere long cauſe ſome of the imperfest Birds to be brought to me. I am therefore by the credible report of honeſt and learned men who were Eye witneſſes perſwaded, that it is a real truth, that Brand Geeſe or Barnacles, are bred out of the rotten Maſts of Ships, after the manner of Muſhroms. In Wales, which is a part of</hi> England, <hi>in</hi> Ireland <hi>and</hi> Scotland, <hi>theſe Birds are found up and down upon the Sea-ſhores imperfect and unfeathered, but having the true and proper ſhapes of Birds.</hi>

                     <p>Hector Boetius <hi>in his deſcription of the Kingdom of</hi> Scotland, <hi>thus writes concerning this matter: It remains (ſaith he) that we ſhould declare what (after long and diligent ſearch into the matter) we certainly know and underſtand concerning the Scostiſh Geeſe which they call Clack-Geeſ, and which are commonly but falſly thought to grow upon Trees in theſe Iſlands. For I conceive that the Virtue which breeds them is rather in the Seas which flow betwixt theſe Iſlands, then in any other thing. For we have ſeen them Gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated ſundry waies, but evermore in the Sea. For if you caſt a piece of Timber into that Sea, in proceſs of time, there are firſt of all Worms bred, the Wood being hollowed, which by little and little have Heads ſhaped, and then Leggs and Wings, and at laſt are covered with Feathers: Finally growing as large as Geeſe, when they are come to their ful ripeneſs of Age they fly in the Air like other fowl, which was evidently ſeen in</hi> Buthphan <hi>by many spectators, in the year of our Lord</hi> 1490. <hi>For when as in that Iſland at the Caſtle of</hi> Pech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlege <hi>a great log of this kind of Wood was brought a ſhore by the Sea Waves, thoſe that firſt eſpied it, being aſtoniſhe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He coming cauſed the Log to be ſawed aſunder, which being done, preſently there appeared an huge Multitude, partly of Worms, of which ſome were yet unſhaped, others had ſome members formed; and partly of Birds perfectly ſhaped, of which ſome bad Feathers, others bad none. Being therefore aſtoniſhed at the ſtrangeneſs of the thing, at the command of the Lord they carry the Log into the Church of</hi> St. Andrew <hi>at</hi> Tyra <hi>(a Village ſo called) where it remains at this day bored through as it were with Worms. The like Log in the</hi> Iſle Taum <hi>was caſt aſhore by the working of the Sea, at the Caſtle of</hi> Bruthe, <hi>two years after, which was ſhewed to many that came running of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſee it. Nor was that any other which two years after the former was ſeen by all the people in</hi> Lethe <hi>a port of</hi> Edin-burge, <hi>For an huge Ship whoſe name and Badge was</hi> St. Chriſtopher, <hi>when it had Lien at Anchor three years together by one of the Hebrides Iſlands, and was brought bither again and laid in Dock, the Beams being eaten aſunder as ſar as it had lien in the Water, there were ſeen therein a great number, partly of ſuch rude Worms, not yet having their perfect ſhape, and partly of fowls fully perfected. But ſome may cavil and ſay, that there is ſuch a virtue in the Wood of the Trees which grow in thoſe Iſlands: and that the Ship</hi> Chriſtopher <hi>was made of Timber which had grown in the Iſlands</hi> Hebrides: <hi>Therefore I ſhall not think it tedious to ſet down, what I my ſelf ſaw ſeven years ago.</hi> Alexander Gallowid <hi>the Paſtor of Kilkenny, a man beſides his ſingular honeſty incomparably ſtudious after Rarities, having drawn out ſome Sea-weeds, and ſeeing betwixt the ſtalk and the branches, from the bottom to the top, certain Shell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh growing, he was amazed at the Novelty of the thing; but when preſently for his fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſatisfaction he opened the Shells be ſtood much more aſtoniſhed then before.

                     <p>Out of all which Narrations it is manifeſt,
<note place="margin">The true Opinion concerning theſe Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Geeſe.</note> that theſe Geeſe are not bred out of rotten Wood, but out of certain Shels, which by means of Sea-weed are faſtened to the holes of rotten wood, as the foreſaid <hi>Mejer</hi> writes. Thoſe Cockles as it were with black Shels are alwaies found ſticking to wood lying in the Water, as to the wooden foundations of Bridges, and to Ships ſunk under the water. Now they ſtick to the wood by certain thrids of Hair or Snevil as it were, or elſe by Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weed. And <hi>Mejerus</hi> adds this alſo in their deſcription, that if the Cockles open themſelves, thoſe ſmal yong Birds appear, like Chickens in their Eggs, which have a Bill, Eyes, Feet, Wings, alſo the Hairy Rudiments of Feathers. And as they encreaſe, ſo their Shells encreaſe, as it is with all Shel-fiſh and Snailes. And cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible it is, that theſe Cockles do draw nouriſhment out of the fat and clammy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of rotten wood, by thoſe pieces of Graſs or Sea-weed, that goes between them, as by Navil-Veſſels. And as to the relation of the Hollanders who found theſe Geeſe ſitting upon Eggs, it may thus be reconciled with the reſt, by ſaying that ſome were firſt bred in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> out of the Shels, which might fly to other places: of the number of which were thoſe Geeſe, which the Hollanders ſaw upon the Rocks in their Voyage to <hi>Nova Zembla.</hi> For ſince the greateſt part of Inſects being Spontaneouſly bred do afterwards couple and Generate: why may not theſe Fowls being Animals much more perfect do the ſame?</p>

                     <p> Now there is nothing of certainty to be found in Authors concerning the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe Geeſe.
<note place="margin">The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of theſe Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Geeſe</note> The ſaid <hi>Mejer</hi> Chap. 5. attributes the Generation of theſe kind of Shels and Birds to the Heaven, and conceits they proceed from I know not what imaginative Virtue in the Heaven. But, as we have ſaid elſwhere, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is only an univerſal Cauſe; whereas here our queſtion is about the next and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate cauſe.

                     <p>And if any one ſhall wonder that a Bird ſhould ſpring out of a Cockle or Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſh, let him think with himſelf that it was as eaſie for the Creator to make a Cockle bring forth a Bird as another Cockle; and let him conſider how many other won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful things do happen in Nature. Amongſt which is that Relation concerning the Lamb which in <hi>Tartaria</hi> grows out of the ground, which <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> Baron of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſtein (in Rerum Muſcoviticarum Commentariis)</hi> thus deſcribes:

                        <hi>Not far,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>from the Caſpian Sea, betwixt the Rivers</hi> Volga <hi>and</hi> Jaik, <hi>there dwelt once the Sawol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſian Kings of whom I ſhall ſpeak hereafter. Among theſe Tartarians,</hi> Demetrius Danielis <hi>(as he was counted among the Barbarians, a grave and credible Man) told me a wonderful and ſcarce credible thing; How that his Father being once ſent from the Duke of</hi> Muſcovia <hi>to the Zawolhenſian King; while he was upon this Embaſſage he ſaw a Seed a little greater and rounder then the Seed of a Musk-Melon, but otherwiſe not unlike the ſame: out of which being ſet in the ground there grew up a thing very like a Lamb five hands high, which they called in their ſpeech</hi> Boramez, <hi>or the little Lamb: For it hath an Head, and Eyes, and Ears, and all other parts like a Lamb newly brought forth, alſo a delicate fine Skin, which many uſe in that Country to line their Caps withal. He ſaid moreover, that this Plant, (if it may be called a Plant) hath blood indeed, but no fleſh: but inſtead of fleſh a ſubſtance very like that of the fleſh of Crabs. Moreover it had little hoofs, not horny like thoſe of a Lamb, but Cloathed with hairs reſembling horn: the Root thereof was at the Navil or the middle Belly. And it lived ſo long, til having eaten all the graſs round about it, the Root it ſelf for want of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment withered away. And this Plant was exceeding ſweet, ſo that Wolves and other Ravenous Beaſts did exceedingly delight to Eat thereof.</hi> This Relation is confirmed by others. <hi>Fortunius Licetus, Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Spont. Vivent. Ortu, Cap.</hi> 45. hath this Relation out of the Journey of <hi>Odoricus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tinenſis</hi> to the great Cham of <hi>Tartary. I write,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a wonderfull thing, not ſeen by my ſelf, but which hath been told me by very credible perſons, who ſay that in a certain Kingdom there are Mountains called</hi> Capeſci, <hi>where grow very great Pompions, which being ripe do open, and therein is found an Animal like a ſmal Lamb, which hath fleſh and the ſubſtance of a Pompion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and although this may ſeem incredible, yet as there are Trees in</hi> Ireland <hi>which bring forth Birds, ſo may there in that place be ſuch Pompions as we ſpeak of.</hi> And in another place he reports the ſame thing ſaying. <hi>One day I ſaw a beaſt, as big as a Lamb, white as Snow, whoſe Wooll being like Cotton might eaſily be pulled off from its Skin; the by-ſtanders being asked told me, that it was given by a certain Baron to the great Cham, as the beſt fleſh in the World for a Man to feed upon: and they ſaid withal, that there was a Mountain called</hi> Capſium, <hi>in which there grew great Pompions, which when they are ripe do gape, and put forth ſuch an Animal. Julius Caeſar Scaliger,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves the ſame in <hi>Exercit.</hi> 181. <hi>Sect.</hi> 29. <hi>The things aforeſaid</hi> (quoth he) <hi>are but toies in compariſon of that wonderful Tartarean plant.</hi> Zavolla <hi>is a prime Country of</hi> Tartaria <hi>Famous as the ſeat of their moſt ancient nobility. In that Country they plant a Seed, very like the Seed of a Melon, but rounder. From whence ariſe a plant which they cal</hi> Boramez, <hi>or the Lamb. For it grows in the ſhape of a Lamb, about three foot above the ground, having Feet, Hoofs, Ears, and the whole head like a Lamb, only it is without horns. Inſtead of borns it hath hair reſembling an horn. It hath a very thin skin whereof the inhabitants make Caps to cover their Heads. They ſay the inner pulp is like the fleſh of a Crab, and of an admirable ſweetneſs. A Root grows out of the ground faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to its Navil. And which makes the wonder greater; as long as any Herbs grow about it, it lives like a Lamb in a good paſture: But when they are conſumed it pines away and dies. Which happens not only by chance, and in tract of time, but alſo when the graſs is taken away, for experiment ſake. And to encreaſe the miracle, it is deſired by Wolves, but not by any other Beaſts which live upon Fleſh.</hi> See concerning this thing, <hi>Andreas Libavius,</hi> 2. <hi>Part. Singular.

<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration according to</hi> Licetus. <hi>Firſt.</hi>
                        </note> But he himſelf holds (which is the firſt manner ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his reckoning) that a Spontaneous Animal is bred out of the Excrements which yet remain in the rotten Wood, together with the Aliment drawn out of the Earth, made up of the dung and Juyces out of the Bodies of ſundry Animals; which afterwards from ſome external agent receives a diſpoſition at laſt, to put on the Nature of an Animal; and the Soul being preſent as in a Veſſel preſently diſplaies it ſelf, and gives it ſelf thereto, as an Eſſential and Quickening form.</p>
                     <p>But although I leave every mans Opinion free to himſelf, yet the Opinion of <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger</hi> is more agreeable to truth. For the vegetable Soul doth not produce the Soul of an Animal nor is changed thereinto, but contains under it another Soul of an Animal, which doth belong to the diſpoſition of the matter, which afterwards being ſet at liberty diſplaies it ſelf. And therefore <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaid not abſurdly, that Plants contain in them certain Seeds for the Generation of Animals. Nor is it ſufficiently proved, that ſuch inſects and imperfect Animals are more noble then the nobleſt Plants; ſeeing both the Plants themſelves have more noble faculties, and are of longer life then ſuch petty Animals; nor were they produced at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the World by the firſt intention of the Creator, as other ſorts of Living things; but were only bred out of the Corruption of other things. And if the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Licetus</hi> were true, a great many more ſorts of Animals would be bred of Woods, ſeeing the Excrements which Plants draw are various, and therefore of the ſame Wood ſundry Animals ſhould be bred; whereas nevertheleſs only cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Animals are bred of certain Plants.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards <hi>Licetus</hi> propounds three other manners,
<note place="margin">The ſecond manner.</note> according to which Animals are bred out of the Carkaſſes of plants. The Second manner he makes to be, when Animals are bred of the Carkaſſes of Plants in the Waters; and that he ſaith comes to paſs, when the Juyces, Excrements or Particles of Animals contained upon any occaſion in the Waters, have in themſelves (as in a Veſſel) ſome weakned part of the former ſenſitive Soul, with a ſmall degree of heat, and ſo cleave to Plants, and ſink into them through ſome pores or Chinks, and being digeſted by the ambient heat they are prepared for life again, whereupon the Soul as lying hid in the Form be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to be a ſubſtantial and quickning Form, and to conſtitute an Animal. But though it is not to be denied, that ſundry Excrements of Animals with their Juyces and parts are contained in the Water, and may there cleave unto Plants: yet if this manner ſhould be allowed, ſundry Animals anſwering to the ſeveral froms of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals ſhould be bred of woods in the waters, which nevertheleſs is not ſo. And therefore after this manner alſo lately declared, I hold that Animals are bred in the Waters out of dry Plants, and that the Water contributes nothing, ſave that it diſpoſes the dead Plants to putrifaction, and ſupplies heat neceſſary to actuate the hidden form.</p>
                     <p>He makes the Third manner to be, when as out of the water,
<note place="margin">The Third</note> in the ſurface of wood, Atomes or Juyces which have flowed from the Bodies of Animals, living or dead, and fly in the Air, do light upon logs of wood, when they are come to a due quantity, and have from the Ambient Air attained a diſpoſition neceſſary for Life. For then the ſenſitive Soul which before lay hid in them as in a Veſſel, gives it ſelf to them in the Nature of a quickning Form. And thus he holds that Moths, Flies, Worms, and other ſuch Animals, are bred in the rotten boughes of Trees, which touch neither the Earth nor the water. But thoſe little Animals are Gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, not ſo much out of the woods, as out of the things which did ſtick to the ſaid woods: and if they are generated of the ſubſtance it ſelf of the rotten woods, they belong unto the firſt manner.</p>
                     <p>Finally, He makes the fourth manner to be,
<note place="margin">The fourth</note> when out of the ſhavings and juyces of Animals ſhed from their Bodies upon the Earth, and from the Earth ſome waies chruſt into the Bodies of dead Plants, being digeſted by the ambient heat, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:35070:211"/>for life, an Animal is bred. But this manner ſeems not much to differ from the Third.</p>
                     <p>Animals are alſo bred of the Juyces of Plants;
<note place="margin">Animals bred of the juyces of Plants.</note> as is ſeen by Vinegar and Wine, and other Juyces, and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> makes mention of wine gnats 5. <hi>Hiſtor. Animal. Cap.</hi> 19. to which alſo Honey may be referred. For Animals are alſo bred there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, eſpecially if bread be mingled therewith. Now <hi>Licetus</hi> makes a twofold origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of theſe Animals, <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Spont. Vivent. Ortu, Cap.</hi> 49. The Firſt is, when in particles long ſince fallen from the Body of an Animal, and infected with Dung and Onions, and preſſed out with Wine or Juyce of Onions and Baſil (for of the Juyce of Onions and Baſil he conceives Scorpions are bred) ſome degree of the former Soul remains, which when by the ambient heat it is cheriſhed and diſpoſed to life; the ſenſitive Soul lying hid as in a Veſſel joyns it ſelf thereto as a quickning form, by which the Worms are firſt Animated. But <hi>Licetus</hi> hath recourſe to the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which he never proved, as if it were impoſſible that an Animal could be bred of other then an Animal; wheras nevertheleſs experience teacheth, that ſuch Ignoble petty Animals are bred of the matter which in living Plants was the proper ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the ſpecifick Form of the Plants. And if Animals were bred of juyces after this manner, not only Flies and Wine gnats would breed out of Wine, but other Animals alſo; ſince it is not credible that the forms of Flies only are contained in the dung wherewith Vines are manured. And whereas many things are every where reported by Authors concerning the breeding of Scorpions out of Baſil, (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which experience muſt be conſulted) it is not credible that all Baſil Plants have drawn with their Aliment the particles of Scorpions; ſince in many places Baſil grows, where there are no Scorpions. It is more credible, that ſince of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Juyces not any Animals but only a certain ſort is bred; the Creator being rather willing that of the Corruption of Plants an Animal ſhould be made, then a putrid Body, hath given to the Bodies of Plants a power for the production of ſuch determinate Forms.</p>
                     <p>Moreover it is well known,
<note place="margin">Some Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate without Copulation Female Mice en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender of themſelves without the Male</note> that moſt Animals are generated by the Copulation of Male and Femal, or of the Seeds of Male and Female Joyned together. Yet it is alſo obſerved that ſome Animals are Generated without the Congreſs of Male and Female. Female Mice engender of themſelves, and thence it is they are ſo ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and plentifully generated. So, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> 6. <hi>de Hiſtor. Animalium</hi> relates, <hi>Cap.</hi> 37. that a Mouſe with young being ſhut up in a Barrel of Milet, a while after the Veſſel being opened, an hundred and twenty yong Mice were found therein. And a little after he writes, that in a part of <hi>Perſia,</hi> a Mouſe with yong being cut up, the Female Mice in her Belly were found to have yong ones in them: and that there are ſome who ſtand ſtifly in it, that if Mice lick Salt they breed yong without Copulation. So that a man may (not without Reaſon) doubt, whether that is true which is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of Mice being bred of rubbiſh. For ſince Mice can be ſo eaſily generated, if ſome Mice do but Leap to ſeek Food out of an old Ship into a new one, they may eaſily grow to a great multitude.
<note place="margin">Eeles have no Male nor Female</note> So <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> tells us that Eels have no Male nor Female 4. <hi>Hiſtor. Animal. Cap.</hi> 11. and that they have neither Seed nor Eggs, but they are generated of a ſlimy matter coming from the whole ſurface of the old Eele, as Snakes Skins come from them. And he tells the ſame thing in 6. <hi>de Hiſtor. Animal. Cap.</hi> 14. and 16.</p>
                     <p>From the premiſes 'tis eaſie to anſwer to the objection of ſome men,
<note place="margin">The Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal of ſame Animals may lie hid in ſundry Bodies.</note> who cannot underſtand how the Seminal matter may lie hid in rubbiſh, (<hi>viz.</hi> Such as mice are ſaid to be bred of, if ſo be they are ſo bred as hath been ſaid) can be of the ſame ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick Nature with the Seed of the Male and Female, of which they are otherwiſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated. For we muſt obſerve that in ſuch more Ignoble Animals Generation is not ſo ſtrictly tied to the Seed of Male and Female, as in perfect Animals, but that one ſex alone may alſo generate. And as ſome Seeds of Plants can conſiſt and abide even in a baſe matter, as in Rain: So alſo the Seminal matter of theſe Animals can lie hid in rubbiſh, or other baſe matter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fortunius Licetus</hi> reckons this kind of Generation,

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:35070:211"/>of Plants which have no ſex by their Seed, or by a branch or Root, is therefore ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med non-Spontaneous, becauſe it is made by the ſame ſort, and by Seed, or part containing in it the Seminal principle: ſo alſo Mice, if they breed Seed in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without the Male, or if Eeles are produced out of the ſlime containing in it the Seminal principle, they are not properly ſaid to be of Spontaneous Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.</p>

For ſomtimes petty Animals are generated in Living Animals; and ſomtimes Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals proceed from the Excrements of Living Animals, and ſomtimes out of the Bodies of ſuch as are dead.

                     <p>As to their Generation,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Animals Breed in Animals after a threefold manner, according to</hi> Licetus.</note> 
                        <hi>Licetus</hi> propounds a threefold way and manner, <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Spont. Vivent. Ortu, Cap.</hi> 51. The Firſt is when the Soul of the old Animal begets another Soul in the Excrements contained within the Body ſubject thereto, not like it ſelf, but much more imperfect; being hindred by the imperfection of the matter; as the Seed of an Horſe coupled with an Aſſe doth not generate the Soul of an Horſe, but one of a far inferior Nature, by Reaſon of the baſeneſs of the matter.</p>
                     <p>The Second manner he makes to be out of the Excrements ſeparated from the Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein (as in a Veſſel) there is a portion of the former living Creature from whence the Aliment came. For ſuch Excrements being digeſted in the Body of the Animal by the heat of the Ambient Bowels, and by digeſtion having attained diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions neceſſary to Life, they come to receive the Latent Soul, in the notion of a quickning form. And after this manner Worms (he ſaies) are frequently bred in the Belly of Man, out of the Excrements of the firſt digeſtion brought thither.</p>
                     <p>The Third manner he holds to be of Excrements into which by the action of heat the ſubſtance of that living thing is turned, in which ſuch Animals are Spontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly generated, in which Excrements there is yet remaining ſome portion of the former Soul, as in a Veſſel; which when by the digeſtive heat of the Ambient Air it hath attained diſpoſitions neceſſary to Life, it gives it ſelf to its ſubject matter in the Nature of a quickning Soul, which conſtitutes divers kinds of Animals; for that the former Soul is ſo impaired as to degenerate into an Eſſence much more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect then it was before. And that after this manner a Serpent may Spontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly breed in the Womb of a Woman, a Flea or Louſe in the Skin of a man, or a Crab-Louſe within the pores of the Skin.</p>
                     <p>But in very deed, as to his firſt manner of Generation, it is hardly agreeable to truth. For it is not yet proved that one Soul can beget another of a different ſort. The forms indeed by the indiſpoſition of the matter are ſo hindred that they cannot attain their end, ſo that ſomtimes Monſters are bred; and that one Soul may put on different Bodies, was ſaid before: but that it may produce another Soul, is not agreeable to truth. Every Soul indeed can multiply it ſelf, not by generating an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other out of or in the ſubject matter, but by multiplying it ſelf, by the divine Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction, and by communicating ſome of its Eſſence, without Diminution of its ſelf. Nor doth a Mule Generate, becauſe the Soul of an Horſe acting upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an Aſs doth produce the Soul of a Mule, as baſer then it ſelf; but the Horſe communicates his Soul, which being mixed with the Seed and Soul of the Aſs doth not produce an Aſs, but a Mule, equally participating of the Nature of an Horſe and an Aſs.</p>
                     <p>Alſo the Second manner cannot take place. Nor when Worms are bred in the Guts, was there a portion of the Soul divided from the Worm; but ſuch was the diſpoſition of the matter, that thereof a Worm might be bred.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, In Excrements indeed into which the ſubſtance of ſome part is turned, Worm are bred, as happens ſomtimes in Ulcers: but who can beleeve that the Soul of a man (for that there is but one Soul in a Man we proved before) ſhould ſo degenerate as to turn into the Soul of a Worm? And to let paſs that queſtion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Soul of a Man; Worms often breed in the Ulcers of Horſes, but who will beleeve that the Soul of an Horſe is turned into the Soul of a Worm? I hold to that which I have ſaid in my 12. <hi>Chap. de Conſenſ. &amp; Diſen. Chymic. cum</hi> Galen. And I have ſaid before in general, that of the matter which is the ſubject of the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick Form ſuch Animals are bred; and therefore as that matter is various, ſo alſo various Animals are generated, and determinate Animals of ſuch and ſuch matter;
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:35070:212"/>in Ulcers Worms, not Lice or Fleas, of the filth of the Skin Lice and Fleas, not Worms. For juſt as Plants (as <hi>Scaliger</hi> writes, <hi>Exercitat.</hi> 59.) breed Animals, not by putrefaction, but cheriſhing certain Seeds within themſelves; and in <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercit.</hi> 100. Animals are not bred in putrid Plants, but are the work of the remaining vigor of the ſaid Plants; ſo is it in Animals: and as he writes in 1. <hi>de Cauſſ. Plant. Cap.</hi> 5. in Spontaneous living things there are certain moſt ſecret Seeds.</p>
                     <p>Moreover Animals are bred of the Excrements of Animals of the ſame ſort.

                     <p> Concerning theſe things therefore we muſt conſult with experience. For all ſuch Animals are not bred of every Animal; but ſome of one only, ſome of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>Nor doth it follow from our Opinion,
<note place="margin">How worms are bred of the Bodies of Animals:</note> as one man cavils, that the Bodies of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, or Serpents themſelves, Frogs, Toads, Lizards, do go to the conſtitution of our Bodies, and that we are actually made up of ſuch things as are deſtructive to our Natures. For no man ever ſaw ſuch Creatures bred of the Body of a Man. And although ſuch things have been bred in Mens Bodies, yet have they not been bred of the Body it ſelf, but of vitious matter brought into the Body from elſwhere. Yet is our Body ſo diſpoſed that ſome Worms may breed thereof, which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs were not actually in the Body, but that matter had a diſpoſition that Worms might be made thereof. Where nevertheleſs this is alſo to be conſidered, ſeeing our Body may be conſidered as in health, and as being ſick, we muſt mark whether theſe Worms are bred in the Body being ſick or in health. And it is moſt credible that ſuch Worms are bred in Mans Body being ſickly, but not as it is ſound; but rather of vitious Aliment, and Excrementitious Humors, as in <hi>Arabia</hi> the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid little Dragons are reported to be bred of Excrementitious Humors in living Bodies; and little Worms breed in the back of Infants, of which we ſpake before. <hi>Johannes Marci</hi> in his <hi>Idea Idearum Operatric.</hi> makes the cauſe thereof to be the eating of Locuſts. For ſince thoſe people Eat Locuſts frequently (from whence they are termed <hi>Acridophagi</hi>) in proces of time there grows an itching and putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in their members, and their fleſh is changed into a kind of inſect not unlike a Locuſt, whereupon they pine away and die. For he writes, that in the Chile and blood, yea and in the fleſh it ſelf, ſtrange forms are contained and may be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, becauſe in all thoſe Mutations nothing is generated contrary to them. For the latter Form approaching doth not change the whole ſubſtance and aboliſh the former Forms, but takes away only ſuch as are contrary to its own faculties. So, that ſame ſubordination of forms muſt not be ſtretched too far, nor muſt we if any thing be bred of the Body of an Animal preſently conclude, that it proceeds from the Natural matter thereof; ſince it may be bred from the Aliment and Excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious Humors therein. So I do not conceive, that the Form which ſhapes the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of a Silk-worm in the Carkaſs of an Heiſer is a form ſubordinate to the form of an Ox, but that it lay concealed in the Mulberry leaves, as appears out of theſe Verſes of <hi>Hieronymus Vida,</hi> in the 2.

And therefore again, <hi>Julius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar Scaliger</hi> did wel write, in 1 <hi>de Plantis,</hi> that there are moſt ſecretly hidden Seeds of Spontaneous live things. And therefore, if we liſt to ſpeak accurately, nothing can properly be ſaid to be Spontaneouſly generated; but every thing is bred of its own Seed, though hidden and not diſcernable by our ſenſes, or at leaſt of a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple anſwering to Seed. And this is all the difference betwixt Spontaneous things and non-Spontaneous, that the latter have a manifeſt Seed, the former an hidden ſecret Seed, or ſomwhat equivalent thereto. For we liſt not here to contend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout words. Only this muſt be remembred, that thoſe things which are ſaid to be Spontaneouſly generated do not proceed from an external equivocal agent, but from an internal principle; which if any man will cal Seed, or a Seminal principle, or ſomwhat anſwering to Seed, he ſhall have my Conſent.

                  <p>AND ſo much ſhall ſuffice to have ſpoken (though but briefly) of a moſt excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hard and obſcure ſubject. It had been eaſie to have diſcourſed more largely of more ſorts of Spontaneous living things: but my purpoſe is not in this place to write a natural Hiſtory, but only to propound the manner of the original of Spontaneous living things, and to declare the ſame by certain examples. And although I know many things may be objected againſt that manner of the Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe things which ſeems to me moſt probable: yet this I know withall, that it is eaſier to oppoſe the truth then to declare the ſame; and that a right line is the meaſure of it ſelf and a croaked line too; and who ever ſhall rightly diſcern the truth may eaſily anſwer all objections, of which a thouſand may be invented.
